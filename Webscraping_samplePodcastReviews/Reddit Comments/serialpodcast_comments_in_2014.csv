anonymous	8	0	"Mostly I listen so, I can come here and be attacked by a mob of people who have a different opinion then I do..../s But really it's because Each episode of Serial has been a amazingly riveting, pieces of entertainment. SK and team produce a high quality show, high production value, they do great research, they build peeks and valleys in the story ark. It's cutting edge journalism, it's breaking boundaries that I'm not sure if we are fully aware of what boundaries are being broken (average joe interacting with the subjects of an ongoing investigative reporting piece???) ....but think honestly we all listen for the same reason. To find out who did it. I'm 100% sure Adnan did it! But I've been wrong before. What's the downside for me of being wrong? I get blown away by an amazing story? alright if he is innocent it's going to be the most epic story ever. So epic that they will change ""bad luck Brian"" to ""Bad Luck Adnan"" but I don't see that happening. I said this in another thread but, there are 1000s of people here creating all kinds of crazy situations so Adnan is innocent, it's ok for a few of us to look at the evidence and to see him as being guilty."	20141126T021139
Nutbrowndog	3	0	It's about more than innocence or guilt. It's about truth, jurisprudence, confirmation bias, police handling or mishandling--it reflects all of us. It's our justice system--our jury system, our police, our fellow man. We all could be someone depicted in the broadcast.	20141126T022321
gaussprime	3	0	Just to be semi-meta, I'll put it this way: I've watched 12 Angry Men a half dozen times, and have enjoyed it, every time in spite of knowing how it ends. Storytelling is tied up with plot, but they're not the same.	20141126T035321
anonymous	5	0	Is it actually hard for you to understand why someone might enjoy the podcast if they felt convinced of his guilt?	20141126T023537
blackwingy	3	0	I think he's guilty, and have since about episode 4 or so, but that has zero to do with why I listen to Serial. It's just great storytelling. In no way does my belief mar SK's narrative and writing skills, the editing, pacing-everything about it is tops. It's surprising you think listening to the show would be pointless unless one believes he's innocent.	20141126T035354
anonymous	2	0	Because it's a pleasure.	20141126T031242
mke_504	1	0	I completely understand the OP feelings. It's more about the people here that go out of their way to be nasty when anyone presents a case for Jay as the murderer. The whole story is riveting, but it's the mystery that makes it fascinating. If there's no mystery for you because you are so convinced of Adnan's guilt that you think any case against Jay is ridiculous, you're kinda missing the whole point of the show.	20141126T053234

bloomfrog	-1	0	I am calling your bluff that you are such a junkie for high quality radio production. And OP's point was not that it could only be interesting if you believed Adnan was innocent; rather, it was that there are too many inherent doubts that have to be ignored to believe 100% that he is guilty (or innocent) and, moreover, that those facts that demand doubt (unless intentionally or subconsciously ignored) are what keep everyone coming back each week.	20141126T045550
anonymous	1	0	I don't think that's what this thread is for but to sum it up; its the overall amount of combined things pointing towards guilt vs. lack of reasonable counter arguments. Note that decision is based on like 5000 other minor judgment calls.	20141126T040812
anonymous	6	0	It's excellent engaging storytelling. I wasn't initially convinced of his guilt, and my enjoyment didn't stop or decrease once I became convinced that he was guilty. I don't really know why it would. I guess we enjoy it for different reasons. I mean no one I knew as a kid thought that OJ was anything but a cold blooded murderer, but literally everyone I knew followed that trial like it was their job.	20141126T024748

It would have to have been someone with motive of a very real personal nature. She could not have been a victim of a random perverted murderer because as we know her body was in the hands of Jay (by his own admission) and Adnan until it was buried in Leakin park.	20141126T050501

joppy77	1	0	"I never said I didn't think Adnan was involved; I'm inclined to believe he was. My comment about Jay was referring to his admission of guilt and knowledge of the car's location.

Superfarmer	4	0	I absolutely think the criminal justice system is flawed and there are many innocent people behind bars. That's in part what makes this vile to me. That this sympathy and energy is wasted on someone who is so clearly guilty. The absolute constellation of wild coincidences that would have to come together for Adnan to be innocent is overwhelming. There are million questions about what happened that day that he has no reasonable answers for. And for a mob of redditors to try and fill those holes is saddening. Look at Fergueson. America is a country that vilifies black people - in spite of their innocence. And here we have a subreddit doing the same to Jay. Jay is not a good person. But his consistencies are greater than his inconsistencies. He cracked the case open. And has shown remorse and emotion over the death of an innocent girl. Which is universes more than Adnan has done. EDIT: GILDED! What does that even mean?!	20141126T175826

Workforidlehands	2	0	"I'm no expert on streaking but it would seem like a good place to be able to indulge without being caught - ie undress, wait for an opportunity and then disappear back into the woodland. Maybe he was stashing his clothes underneath the log in order to reduce the chances of them going missing again. I've seen nothing to convince me he went looking for Hae's body but find his simple ""I went for a pee"" statement unconvincing too."	20141126T123501
anonymous	1	0	So you're theorizing that maybe he was planning to stash his clothes and then jump in the road streaking and use the woods for cover afterwards? I think that's the most logical explanation I've heard so far. Especially since (if I remember correctly) he had a history of running up to cars nekkid.	20141126T160953
Workforidlehands	2	0	It's what sprang to mind simply because any victims would have to follow him back into the woods on foot. A victim would likely follow from the safety of a car but Leakin Park would remove that opportunity. Having been caught numerous times I imagine he'd improved his MO to avoid future capture.	20141126T182008

ShrimpChimp	8	0	Flip side is Adnan is a drama llama seeking attention and painting himself as the victim, making Hae look bad, and that whole ego show. I side with your interpretation, but on slim and incomplete evidence. We don't know enough to make a call. A lot of this stuff has to be written of as inexplicable teenage nonsense. Their teachers might have a better idea.	20141126T025442
joppy77	2	0	"I don't think it means much either way. It's one of the countless ambiguous factors in the case that can take on a number of subjective meanings under post-murder scrutiny. Without a much better understanding of the various social/relationship dynamics involved, it's hard to read any meaning or motive into it. The main thing about it that strikes an odd note is the ""I'm going to kill"" line, but even that is too ambiguous to read too much into without context."	20141126T104846
UseAMaleShrimp	2	0	He was sharing it with Aisha, Hae's best friend, who likely already knew about Hae's feelings and perhaps the note itself. Don't forget that the note is from a few months before Hae's murder. They break up and Hae sends the note, they get back together, then they break up again, and *then* she dies. Says very little about his mindset or her's at the time of the murder.	20141126T030425
asha24	1	0	Hmmm I haven't thought of it that way, but yeah you're right, he was basically sharing a rejection letter.	20141126T023355
claud334	1	0	I wouldn't personally read too much into someone's overall character from the fact that they shared any random humiliating letter. However, I do think if a person were upset enough about breaking up with someone to kill their ex, s/he probably wouldn't be sharing the rejection letter casually in class.	20141126T025525
8shadesofgray	1	0	Were Adnan and Aisha sharing it? I don't know why I had always thought it was Aisha and Hae. This makes a lot more sense ... I could never understand how Hae got the letter back and then it subsequently ended up in Adnan's bedroom :)	20141126T033724

It's also very possible to not agree with someone, but still make fun of their ex, them, and yourself. Especially if you're all friends. If anything, their scribbles go against this theory. There's no sign of sympathy for Adnan. (They also go across the controlling, angry ex theory.)	20141126T131627

distortederly	3	0	I have seen this before and I do not think it is unfairly prejudiced. Why do you think so? The fact is that the people talking to the police and telling the story (Jay and Jenn) were full of shit mostly. While this neither explains everything nor proves any degree of guilt/innocence, it surely elucidates the point. This gal went through the briefs which I like tying in actual testimony to the call log which makes them look like they're concealing a less desirable truth.	20141126T060545
mo_12	1	0	"What backs the assertion that the L689B is a tower/antenna ""whose range is almost exclusively limited to the southwest leg of Leakin Park""? This to me is a crucial assertion but logically it makes very little sense to me. On the map, the illustrated range is both the smallest geographic area of any of the towers highlighted AND covers the least dense areas. Why would the cell company put a tower here just to cover Leakin Park, a place where relatively very few calls would be made? Especially in 1999 when it's not expected that you have universal coverage everywhere you go. I'm not saying the cell company didn't do this (businesses do illogical things fairly frequently), but it seems unlikely. I would like some source backing up that assertion."	20141126T160831
dev1anter	2	0	I want to believe police did something similar at the time with Jay, Jenn and adnans stories. but if they did they would see how Jays story(s) didn't make ANY sense	20141126T134516

stoopydumbut	5	0	The bias is the supposition that Jay had Adnan's car and phone while Adnan was at mosque that evening, in contradiction to Adnan's own testimony that he probably dropped off Jay before going to mosque. On the other hand, there's enough information here too draw either conclusion, depending on which assumptions you favor. After reading this, I'm still undecided. However I'm convinced that if the police had decided to build a case against Jay instead of Adnan that Jay would be in prison today.	20141126T075350
dev1anter	3	0	it seems unlikely that they put the smallest and cheapest antennae in a place where, by your words, relatively very few calls would be made? makes perfect sense to me. (if i understood you correctly). don't know about the USA carriers, but leakin park is in baltimore. it's in the city. i'd expect having signal in the city. i understand it's not exactly downtown but still.	20141126T165842
dev1anter	3	0	Well, all the calls made from the phone are to Jays friends. So maybe adnan really has shit memory. It's not like he had his phone in his hand at the mosque. Or maybe he was high and forgot it in the car	20141126T141113
mo_12	1	0	"Where do you get that it was the smallest and cheapest? That's the sort of backing I'm looking for but not seeing. That still doesn't make great sense to me. This is 1999 where you as a customer wouldn't necessarily expect coverage in a park that isn't widely used. Also, ""smallest and cheapest"" doesn't make a ton of sense to me - the fixed costs of such a tower would likely be enough that it would make more sense to put one there that would have a much greater range outside the park."	20141127T034349
dev1anter	1	0	I'm afraid you'd have the ask the carrier himself	20141127T034636
mo_12	1	0	I guess I'm not being clear: do you know that that antenna is smaller than the others? Where did you get the information that the range is that small? EDIT: Sorry, I didn't realize you weren't the author. I'm literally trying to figure out if those ranges are reliable. They don't seem logical to me, but I would defer to actual reliable sources verifying them. Here's what the author did say, in a comment to her post: >I didn’t do overlay of the territorial divisions, and I have no idea who did (p.s., if someone who sees this did it, let me know so I can give credit!), but the boundaries around each area mark the approximate equidistant points between cell towers; each cell tower’s territory includes all the points for which that tower will be the closest, and for which (all other things being equal) a call placed from that point has the highest probability of being routed through that tower. To me, that doesn't at all mean that the marked ranges indicate the whole of each tower's range. The purpose of the Leakin Park tower could very easily be to provide redundant coverage to other towers so that during times of high load (say in the 7:00 hour), calls in other towers' ranges would be routed through L689. The drawing of the range showing that it only encompasses Leakin Park is causing us to overly weight the likelihood that the phone was actually in Leakin Park.	20141127T124730

It's not a magic word that prints an embellished S on the bearer's chest so that all of the rest of us can go about our lives in virtue and rectitude. *Asshole* covers a hell of a lot of non-clinical, non-diagnosable behavior.

So if you have someone who continually beats on their spouse, runs cons, steals cars and gets in fights, and you deal with the socioeconomic factors, figure out the underlying situational triggers and deal with those, go through anger management and impulse control treatment, medicate for a neurotransmitter deficit and little to nothing changes... that would be the time. But you start with anger management and socioeconomics. Sociopathy is a long-term pattern. or, in the case of a teenager... Eric Harris is probably the better textbook case. In his case, his socioeconomic status and high parental involvement masked the early signs but retrospect pings at minor offenses to vandalism to drug offenses to social misadustments to combativeness and defiance to light violence before the big day.

anonymous	1	0	It depends on the professional. So a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (who is a therapist) or a master's level psychologist should absolutely refer up the line to either a doctorate level psychologist who partners with a psychiatrist or to a psychiatrist, and either of those professionals should be specialized in ASDs, since the therapy used for people exhibiting anti-social behavior that stems from another disorder will actually help someone with an ASD diagnosis just be better at screwing other people over. (Therapy gave some in residential settings better tools for faking empathy. Huge mess in the early days.) As of today, there is no real treatment for ASDs, just coping strategies and incentives. And some professionals do refuse to work with that diagnosis, because it does pose a higher than background risk to the therapist. (We can't practice if we're dead, after all.)	20141127T201657

mangosplumsgrapes	1	0	"Ok, I'm assuming this is the mental health criteria you use for antisocial personality disorder. Basically, ASPD disorder is the term that we give to people who display repeated violent and criminal behavior who won't rehabilitate. This is useful for a diagnosis to give to that specific behavior in the clinical setting, but that's it. Sociopathy and psychopathy are not exactly the same thing as ASPD. The terms psychopathy and sociopathy refer to a specific type of person who lacks the ability to feel empathy for others and the ability to feel guilt or remorse. So for example, a CEO of a large company that knowingly engages in unethical behavior that hurts or directly/indirectly kills others and feels no guilt or remorse about it could be termed a psychopath. A government/military operator who knowingly kills civilians and feel not a wink of sadness about it, but instead enjoys the thrill of war, could be termed a psychopath. Neither of these people would qualify for ASPD because they are not committing crimes (our gov't considers killing civilians ""collateral damage"") and because they are functioning well in society. However, because of their lack of empathy, remorse and guilt, they could be considered psychopaths. Only the people who are unable to function in society get diagnosed with ASPD. But those are not the only type of people who display the characteristics of psychopaths and sociopaths. There are many many who display these characteristics, but who function well in society, and for the most part are able to exercise self control throughout their lives. I personally think psychopath and sociopath are very useful terms. I also understand that they are not used by medical professionals."	20141126T082032

anonymous	1	0	The thing I don't think you're getting is that there is no treatment for any of the anti-social spectrum. They're an empathy circuit fault (to grossly oversimplify) and we have no means for correcting it. Thus, by definition, when we get to that diagnosis, it's endgame. Everything after is coping technique. The PCL does factor in quasi-legal antisocial behavior, such as during military service or security employment. It does factor legal or quasi-legal financial malfeasance (such as fraudulent or ethically flexible business dealings). Do you think we haven't considered this? Yeah, they have, but it's not first line. The behavioral differences between clinical psychopathy and someone who is dissociated, oppositional-defiant, non-attached and with poor impulse control is minor to nil. The difference is in functionality of treatment -- can we help reinstall the tools? Yes, in the latter. No in the former, and we only get to that no after we try. The vernacular usage of the words is like the vernacular usage of the word theory versus the scientific usage. The Theory of Gravity means a very different thing than supposition or guess. The vernacular usage of psychopath is non-specific and a euphemism for evil, which carries uncomfortable cultural baggage. We use the specific terms correctly. Psychopathy, sociopathy, Anti-social Personality Disorder are all specific and precise terms of art. (And terms that have generated their own inter-community flame wars, but what doesn't? The disagreements are over fine distinctions, not generalizations.) But they're your opinions. You're as entitled to it as anyone.	20141126T085344

In my observation, I think most murders are cases more of ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" and the deceit for concealment after the fact is more punishment avoidance and scramble.

And there are people out there who might commit one violent act, but no others, who would be considered sociopaths based on their lack of guilt, remorse or empathy for the victim. Basically, what I'm saying is that the way we use the terms in vernacular is a useful way to use it, and labels something that I think is definitely real. And that when people on this reddit ask mental health professionals to weigh in on a diagnosis of psychopathy and sociopathy, those people don't understand that mental health professionals do not diagnose this. I am not saying that the people you diagnose with ASPD do not meet the criteria for psychopathy and sociopathy, but that they are only a small portion of the psychopaths and sociopaths out there."	20141126T092030

There are times when no decision is right, someone is going to get hurt, and the only options are bad or worse. From an idealized point, such decisions can look like lack of empathy. In this case, I go with frightened, desperate, covering up and ill-equipped. One bad decision -- whatever it was -- lead to a cascade of many, many more.

According to Jenn's testimony at trial, Jay asked her to send the cops to him sometime before her first interview on the 26th. But she doesn't. So why did she wait until the next day? I guess lawyers maybe...? Sorry, just trying to piece this bit together. It just makes me wonder whether the whole story was sold to Jenn between late night on February 26th (after Jenn's first unrecorded interview, in which she says nothing) and the morning of January 27th and that's why their stories - which have glaring inconsistencies - don't really work well together. They didn't have enough time to get them straight. Wouldn't you have your story straight by now? It's been over a month. And if you believe they both knew everything on January 13th, then they even had a chance to brush up on their story on the evening of January 26th when it started getting real. Why are there so many inconsistencies between them? Jay could have told her his whole tale on the evening of the 26th, and implied that she needed to lie to substantiate his claims about what happened on January 13th by convincing the cops that he spilled the beans to her on the night of the murder. It makes his story more believable. Meaning, he could have said, ""I couldn't tell you on the night because I didn't want to involve you,"" or ""I was scared, Adnan threatened me and Stephanie. But it's all true, so please just tell them these key points: Best Buy, shovel(s), strangulation, Adnan, heartbreak."" The current alleged sequence of events requires us to believe that both Jenn and Jay sat on this until it was too late and they had to fess up. Fair enough. But was she really that close to Jay, that she would help him dispose of known murder weapons and let Adnan run around free as a bird, threatening people all the way? Wouldn't Jenn have socialized with Jay and Adnan in the weeks after the murder and before she gets questioned? After all, the call that Nisha actually remembers tells us that Adnan and Jay were hanging out at the video store after the murder. What, Jenn's just like, ""Hey there's Jay's buddy, the strangler! Don't worry about those shovels, wink-wink. We got you covered."" whenever she sees Adnan? Is she just hiding her extreme fear this whole time? Of course if the cops DID visit Jay late at night and off the record on February 26th, this adds a whole new element to the potential deception. Also, why in the world is the drive to find the car basically just the detectives and Jay in a car at midnight. Can I get a witness, dammit?

If Asia had testified, a huge monkey wrench would have been thrown at the state's case ... forcing them to regroup. I'm also conjecturing atm that Asia is black (from name, speech, etc.). The cynical side of me says that if you pit Asia against Jay come trial it matters from a race perspective.	20141126T045959
StaceyCarosi	1	0	I've been thinking that he confessed to Gutierrez as well- or at least confessed some significant involvement and they decided it was best to just hang their hat on innocent, since the murder timeline/details did not happen as outlined by the prosecution. Gutierrez was an in-demand criminal defense attorney. It takes significant time and experience to be permitted to even defend a criminal against a death penalty/life in prison case. She was generally well respected, handled many similar cases and there is no reason why she would have ignored the Asia letters unless she knew they were untrue. I also think it's very strange that Adnan would not have asked her about Asia being an alibi once they learned that the prosecution was arguing the murder occurred by 2:36pm. Keep in mind the defense puts its case on after the prosecution. I also think we're sort of asked to doubt Gutierrez's efforts from the beginning because SK wrote an article about her that was seen by Rabia.	20141126T162742
gts109	1	0	Solid thought. I'm a lawyer (civil, not criminal). An attorney could write that down. But I wouldn't. What if a third party sees the note? Then the attorney-client privilege is blown by disclosure to a third party, and you've revealed your client's guilt to the world. Whoops! It's also more difficult to defend a client that you know did it. You have to be careful not to suborn perjury. That problem isn't as big here because Adnan didn't testify, but perhaps that's another reason that he didn't testify. The lawyer knew he was guilty, and couldn't allow him to lie on the stand. This is one of those things that I don't think we'll ever know, however, so I don't think people should really consider it in trying to determine Adnan's guilt. It's also not the type of thing that the state would ever know during an ineffective assistance of counsel appeal. The note would be protected from disclosure to the state, so it's very unlikely to be an argument it could raise in response to claim that Gutierrez should have followed-up with Asia.	20141126T194130

I realize that this seems like a stupid reason to lie, considering that murder or accessory to murder would hurt him more than whatever the pool hall investigation turned up, but maybe Jay was pushing his luck. Teenagers make incredibly short-sighted decisions when they try to minimize their appearance of guilt. I've worked with troubled youth who have lied to the point of absurdity to evade responsibility when stealing or using drugs. Ultimately, this is complete conjecture. It's just a possibility I pondered. I don't have a horse in this race; I'm just hoping for justice.	20141126T052515
anonymous	7	0	"Ok I'll get killed but my theory is (as short as possible I could fill in a lot more speculation) Jan 8th: smoke out session A and J shooting the shit, Adnan is hurt from the break up. A is bitching about Hae and somehow it comes up to kill her. Jay fuels the fire not really thinking it's not going to go anywhere (honor student, religious) he may even help plan it out. Jan. 12th Adnan tells Jay he's going to go thru with it.(he may offer to pay Jay to help) Jay says ""yea sure"" Jan 13th A drops off the car with Jay they go shopping for??? a duffle bag or other ""equipment"" J is going along as ""this is crazy"" and ""this guy is never going to go thru with this"" They were both committed to the plan but they were both to proud to backdown. Adnan does it and Jay lies his ass off to stay out of jail."	20141126T042357
anonymous	2	0	When we talk abut Jay lying, I think we frequently discount that he's also recalling details well after the fact, for which he was high for some/all of the time. He's also doing this in the context of telling a story to the police that is essentially a confession to being an accessory to murder, so he's under a lot of pressure. Then at the second interview he's trying to keep his story straight but also trying to make his story mesh with the call logs he now has access to. From there on out the consistency of his story is already shot and he just says what he needs to keep the prosecutors who are giving him a sweetheart deal happy. Point is, his lies aren't necessarily sinister or premeditated.	20141126T055725
cat_morgue	4	0	I haven't yet decided if I think Jay or Adnan was the primary killer, but I feel it's pretty apparent that Jay is far more involved than he wants to admit, both to the police and SK after the fact. While binge listening, I had an idea -- what if Jay tried to make a pass at Hae after she and Adnan split up? Maybe she rejected him and he lost his temper and strangled her to death. Or maybe he murdered her to prevent Hae from telling his girlfriend Stephanie? It wouldn't be the first time something like this occurred. However, I don't know how Adnan would factor into this theory. Perhaps Jay confessed to Adnan, which is why Adnan didn't attempt to contact Hae via pager or phone after she had gone missing?	20141126T034845
CJSchmidt	1	0	One likely scenario: He meets up with Adnan who just snapped and killed her. Jay sees himself as the fixer from Pulp Fiction and takes over from there - loving every minute of it. He can't pretend like he wasn't involved, so he wants to look like he's just the pot head idiot who got swept along with events. I'm guessing he was also covering for his girlfriend too (where they went instead of the park across town). Hell, maybe he got Adnan so high that he doesn't even remember doing it.	20141126T081638
Lancelotti	1	0	Jay tried his best to keep his friends out of the story. So he has to make things up as he goes along which then don't fit with the evidence.	20141126T094026
CharlesVillage	2	0	"I just can't relate to the whole ""Jay's lying, but he's essentially telling the truth"" mentality. His story is the main piece of evidence against Adnan.

anonymous	1	0	Oh I had not thought of that possibility. I figured that he was there when the murder went down, but I also couldn't reconcile why that justified lying as much as he did. It's kind of a goofy idea but I like it.	20141126T043016
Shane099	2	0	I'm only a few episodes in, and I was just about to post the same thing. Jay could have been jealous and upset with how close Adnan & Stephanie were, as was suggested. So Jay went after Hae to make a sexual pass at her (If he's taking my girl, I'll take his). Hae got upset, and Jay overpowered her. He somehow went too far, and felt he had to kill her. I haven't really put together what I think happened after.	20141126T065119

rosseky	1	0	That's why the important thing is the corraborating evidence. The state uses the pats of Jays story that have other proof, which shows that those parts are likely true. This is what they built a case on. If you think jay did it, or that the cops had it out for Adnan, you would also need corraborating evidence. The absence of evidence against jay I'd why he is innocent. Just because someone can come up with a story that blames someone other than Adnan does not make that story plausible.	20141126T131806

In her car in the parking lot at the Woodlawn Library (Jay’s Story to Chris). Jay has no idea (Jay’s Story to Jenn). Patapsco State Park (Jay’s Third Interview). >Places Where Adnan Showed Hae’s Body to Jay: At Edmondson Avenue (Jay’s First Interview). At the Best Buy (Jay’s Second Interview). Never, Jay was with Adnan when he killed her (Jay’s Third Interview). At Franklintown Road (Brief of Appellant at 12) (Detective MacGillivary testified “that [Jay] told him that [Adnan] showed him Hae’s bodyin the trunk on Franklintown Road”). At a pool hall in Catonsville (Episode 8) (“[Jay] was shooting pool, Adnan called him he was like ‘yo, I gotta talk to you,’ and he was like ‘yo I’m busy.’ ‘Yo, where are you’ and he told him where he was. Adnan showed up and he’s like ‘oh I gotta talk to you’ and he’s like– this was a little tug of war for a while and Adnan eventually convinced him to come outside with him and his car or, I.”) When the body was in the trunk of Hae’s car (Trial Testimony). When the body was in the back of a truck (Trial Testimony) (referencing prior statements to police). >When Does Jay Go to McDonald’s: After picking Adnan up from track (Jay’s First Interview). While waiting for Adnan to come back from the Park’N’Ride with Hae’s car so they can bury the body (Episode 5). >When Does Jay Go to Patapsco State Park: After 2:15 p.m., to help Adnan kill and/or dispose of Hae, because “[Adnan] killed Hae in Patapsco State Park,” and “[Adnan] paid [Jay] to help” (Jay’s Third Interview). At 4:30 p.m., after ditching Hae’s car and after buying weed. Once there, while “standing . . . at this cliff and [Adnan] starts telling [Jay]about how it was when he killed her,” while they watch the “[s]un getting ready to hit mountain tops” (Episode 5). They are there for “[t]wenty minutes to a half an hour” (id.). (And yet somehow Adnan makes it back to Woodlawn in time for track.)

There have been brain imaging scans of psychopaths that show they have different brain structures and functioning than normal people: http://www.med.wisc.edu/news-events/psychopaths-brains-show-differences-in-structure-and-function/32979 http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/07/us-brains-psychopaths-idUSBRE8460ZQ20120507 I know David will probably not see this, but I needed to correct him	20141126T072238

anonymous	11	0	I think what she's doing is purposeful for tons of reasons, namely because of her role as a journalist and the nature of the narrative. As a reporter, you often have to pose seemingly obvious, open-ended questions to your interview subjects because even if you think you have the answer, you have to get it from the other person so your audience can hear it directly from the horse's mouth. Otherwise, you're just putting YOUR words in their mouths. Plus, a slew of other reasons people here have already mentioned (e.g. getting Adnan to feel comfortable talking to her, keeping her audience guessing, etc.)	20141126T064803
Malort_without_irony	6	0	"I don't think that naive is the right word and I think that Waldman is half right. I think the notion that a person is knowable is more thesis than axiom for Koenig. It's right there, in the description of the show: >all of it leads back to the most basic questions: How can you know a person’s character? How can you tell what they’re capable of? In Season One of Serial, she looks for answers. I think it's dangerous just to leave it as ""nice guy"" when discussion Adnan. I do suspect that her primary window to this case is a fascination with Adnan, almost to creepy levels. There's something particularly high school crush about the whole thing, what with talking on the phone every day with authority figures controlling in the background. But that fascination isn't limited to her. I think a lot of us are fascinated by Adnan. And one of those things that's struck me about reading discussion about the case is, second only to the sort of ""but the payphone was left handed"" rabbit chase through the evidence is the attempt to read the tea leaves of character. For Adnan, for Jay, for just about everyone, even the detectives. So, with Adnan as locus, Serial is an examination of the idea of understanding someone's character. It's not ""how could such as good guy commit such a heinous deed,"" but ""how should I square what I know about this particular man, and what he's accused of, and how does that change how I look at knowing people."" In other words, I think treating it as a matter of credulity is the wrong way to look at it, because that's the question she's experimenting with."	20141126T063508

He called her out on it and she seemed oblivious. He's made it clear that he's not in this to be friends with yet another stranger who thinks he's a nice guy. He's using her for her profession- to get his story out and his case review. He clearly sees the 30+ hours of phone calls as nothing but work on his end while she seems or seemed to think that the time was spent as part work, part play. Like he said, he'd rather she think he's an asshole who was wrongfully convicted based on what happened with his trials rather than yet another person claiming he couldn't have done it because he's such a nice guy.

Rolyat136	1	0	"**(For the *""sake of the polemic""* )** Serial"" is primarily an entertainment (in the broadest sense of that word) project not an invitation to serious consideration concerning the guilt of the defendant, the validity of the verdict, or the justice of the sentence. There are only two items ""proven"" by the podcast and its attendant notoriety. First, Ms. Koenig and her team are masterful practitioners of the ""radio narrative"" art form. (think of Orson Wells's *""War of the Worlds""* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_%28radio_drama%29 think of the fabulist's excellent adventure on Ira Glass's *""TAL""* http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction Every detail (right down to the amount of *""vocal fry""* engineered onto the audio tracks) of Koenig's presentation is *""shaped and crafted""* toward the goal of creating an emotionally attractive narrative. Second, Audiences can always be gulled by narrative prestidigitation. All of the information concerning this murder - the police investigation, the prosecution, and the defense - are presented through Ms. Koenig, with very sparse access to materials (transcripts, recordings, written reports) that could validate her POV for me. The failure to make available the transcripts or recordings of the trial removes this ""story"", as presented by Ms. Koenig, from serious considerations on whether the jury's verdict was deserved. Her withholding of the opening and closing statements in particular make her characterizations of the case for the prosecution appear intentionally anemic and cramped. Besides having access to the case materials she withholds, it would be interesting to see just how much of this case and its principals Koenig has previously reported on, especially when she was with the Baltimore Sun."	20141203T154358

peetnice	3	0	> She was all giddy with excitement about news that was more important to her story than his case. He called her out on it and she seemed oblivious. I think she purposely played up that stark contrast to make it more impactful to the listener, not when she initiated the call, but as soon as he responded. She then refocused from his perspective, and pointed it out even more in the narration over the conversation. I think this kind of story-telling should be familiar to any regular TAL listener. The reporter knows more than they tell, and they plan out how to slowly reveal it in storybook format. They also like to ask stuff they already know, like Colombo, just to hear it from the horse's mouth.	20141126T074424

Whether or not you meant to be ad hom[fem]onym is irrelevant to me, as that was the implication, one I take seriously. I wanted you to understand that given my background and experience, any questions I raise have always-already been sent through the prism of feminism, gender equality and civil rights. I hold SK to a high standard *because of her extensive journalistic experience*. I seek to avoid putting her in a gender- or hetero-normative box and do not think I've done so. Though there is a feminized societal context of the word naive, I would absolutely pose this exact same question were the host a male. Naiveté is a particular preoccupation of mine. It's not in any way an encapsulation of my view of her as a person, rather, a word that invites polemic, and people ran with it below. I am also preoccupied with linguistics and speech - hence my delight at pointing out a really great instance of vocal fry. It, like a regional accent, is something people adopt as an expensive social buy-in, [along theses lines](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/667654?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21105304621523). In pointing it out, I wish to hold up Waldman's agency in employing vocal fry as a social marker, not simply to reduce her to it or to belittle her on those grounds. I realize it has been taken up as a misogynistic weapon, though one I give little weight to. I pointed out Adnan's vocal and grammatical mannerisms as well, and those of Mail Kimp girl.	20141126T204453

There is no evidence That I'm aware of that can be used to rule out one of the two stories. That was Gutierrez job and she may have just chosen a bad strategy. But There just isn't much evidence to work with so a coherent story, even if supported by only weak evidence, is probably very hard to refute.	20141127T022421
namahoo	1	0	Could well be. That's how she'd get a hit podcast out of such a dud. I had that in mind, actually, but didn't spell it out. Here it is: If she were a man, she wouldn't get away with playing the naive.	20141126T210305
readybrek	1	0	If they can get a credible witness that shows Adnan getting in the car with Hae after 3pm - then that's pretty much game over. Summer came forward because of the podcast, who knows who else they might have tracked down. The only problem I have with this is that it would be kind of unethical getting the Innocence project involved if it were pretty certain he was guilty.	20141204T122249
anonymous	1	0	You're speculating based on weak evidence. I try not to speculate at all. This leads me to believe there's just no real evidence to work with; it's one story against another. Here's another way to look at your claims: 1. Motive: Adnan's motive is unsubstantiated. there's zero verifiable evidence that he was capable of murder. No prior history of violence against women. No criminal record. Is every ex boyfriend without an alibi a murder suspect? And even the claim that he couldn't get over Hae is weak. There's some witnesses who say he had moved on and others who say he hadn't. 2. Jay has no motive. But he is a violent person. There is evidence of this in that he has a criminal record. Perhaps he snapped and killed Hae for some reason we're unaware of. At least there's more evidence that he's capable of murder than there is for AS. Or perhaps there's a 3rd party. No one really tested either of these possibilities because they got fed AS and ran with it. We know the police just wanted to put someone away. They found a plausible suspect and went after him. I don't buy either motive. Point is, there's no real evidence to work with. 3. Adnan not accusing Jay is evidence of his guilt? Maybe he has no evidence that Jay did it. Maybe his lawyer told him not to speak out against Jay to Koenig. Maybe he did speak out but we haven't heard it. Again, this is just speculation. 4. The state invented a compelling narrative based on weak evidence. The judge and jury bought it. Anyone could. It's a good story. Put Jay on trial and redditors could invent an equally compelling narrative based on weak evidence.	20141127T042627
anonymous	1	0	Yeah but 15 years later... I doubt it's possible to find a credible witness. To be certain of guilt, we'd need actual evidence of AS either killing Hae (video, DNA etc), transporting her body, him at the burial site or driving her car or with her in the car. we have no such evidence - just Jay's story - so people base their guilty verdicts on assumptions. We can't test those assumptions without more information. I see no ethical issue in the IP attempting to collect more information that could possibly help provide a better understanding of what happened that day.	20141204T155351
anonymous	1	0	Circumstantial evidence is weak by definition, no? It's like this idea that you can just add up a half dozen untestable assumptions and then assign guilt even though each piece of evidence would seem like a minor inconsistency or could support more than one story. A bit outrageous, but to illustrate my point, If a person is sick for a week, should we conclude they have cancer? If a half dozen people report unknown lights in the sky, should we conclude that we're being visited by aliens from another planet? How can small anomalies equal guilt? Are you a lawyer? Is his really how the legal system works? I cannot believe anyone can be put away for life using plausible but untestable assumptions based on weak evidence.	20141127T051113
anonymous	1	0	Have you read thinking fast and slow? Humans are generally irrational. There's a whole section in the book about how we humans will jump on a causal story linking A and B not because it's empirically valid but because we want the world to make sense. Given this tendency it's not surprising to me at all that the jury convicted. They were sold a great story by the state. Consider these basic facts. *Neither J not AS has an alibi during the critical 45 minute period from 2:36 to 3:15. * the ping data clearly puts the phone at the burial site between 7 and 8. But the only thing that puts AS there is Jay and Jenn who worked together. There is no physical evidence that AS was there. gotta go more later	20141127T143225
Workforidlehands	1	0	"""the ping data clearly puts the phone at the burial site between 7 and 8"" This is a terrible misrepresentation of the evidence."	20141127T144801
anonymous	1	0	I don't know if I'm making myself clear. There is almost no evidence in this case at all. There's one unreliable witness who's at the mercy of the state. There's no forensic evidence. The ping data is somewhat useful at least in terms of helping the state add the illusion that there's some kind of science backing their story. So what you get is a very nice neat story told by the only witness that connects a few ping datapoints together and the jury eats it up. In other words, Jays story fits the data because there is no data. This is not to say AS is innocent or Jay is guilty; there just isn't any evidence to say anything at all. It's a coin flip. What is it that convinces you of anything?	20141128T040845
8shadesofgray	6	0	"There's a huge number of Don posts if you want to dig into it (search function in the upper right corner ... Be sure to check the ""limit my search"" check box). From what I can gather, Don was interviewed by the police but dismissed as a suspect because of the alibi RawbHaze has mentioned. Some people here (myself included sometimes) question how strong that alibi is, given that the unclear time of Hae's abduction and murder are ambiguous ... People have speculated about how long he was at work, how it was verified, if he had a scheduled break, etc. Very little is known about him outside of what you've already heard on the Podcast. Trial documents show he did testify during the case. One poster on here claimed in a post (sorry, don't remember which one ... There's a lot of Don posts) that he was a co-worker of Hae's and Don's at Lenscrafters and offered his own perspective on how Don reacted to Hae's disappearance and subsequent confirmation of her death. There's lots of speculation on here, so happy exploring!"	20141126T082727

MusicCompany	3	0	I think you make an interesting point because this incident shows that Jay and Jenn, that day, were downplaying the incident. They weren't trying to make Adnan look bad. At that time, they clearly wanted it to blow over. This is consistent with their reluctance to talk to the police or reveal what they knew. It shows that Jay and Jenn weren't conducting a conspiracy to frame Adnan.	20141126T202809

Irkeley	2	0	We don't know too much about the autopsy. There is talk about her having been hit with a blunt object prior to strangulation, and the coroner was interrupted by the prosecution when he/she testified in court. I cant find the transcript, but it was regarding a question related to whether she was manually strangled or with a rope. Also it's unknown whether she was raped. All we know is that they tested for sperm, and found none. Signs of rape would of course alter the whole case, as it indicate a different type of predator/motive. I don't think they would withhold this evidence, but they just never tested. The innocence project is currently looking into testing more samples from the rape test kit. They also found blood in her car, and it was not Adnan, Jay or Hae's blood.	20141126T081435
Irkeley	2	0	Did you see the autopsy report? I'm asking because I have many questions. What caused her head injury? Why was it not clear that she was manually strangled? Why was she not tested for rape?	20141126T095833

nautilus2000	15	0	Except that we've had people in this subreddit that are familiar with the area and the kindergarten say that people routinely arrived at the kindergarden around 20-30 minutes early so that they could avoid the very long line of cars that formed to pick kids up. Considering that Hae probably did not fly from her last class to her car, and it took her around 10 minutes to get to it and probably more since she'd be saying bye to friends or getting a snack, it seems likely that she indeed had no or minimal free time right after school.	20141126T080204
MDbluecrabs	6	0	I totally agree. I have also started re-listening to all of the episodes (serious Serial withdrawal) and this part also stood out to me a lot more than it did the first time around. The other thing that really makes me doubt Adnan here is that Jay also told the police that Adnan said he was planning to ask Hae for a ride after school, and then that was corroborated by multiple friends of Hae who had no idea that Jay told police that this was how Adnan planned to kill Hae. There is no other way for Jay to know that Adnan had asked for a ride, he doesn't attend that school at this point and he is not friends with Hae. It seems like a small detail but it seems way too coincidental.	20141126T150343
anonymous	2	0	"In my opinion, her not having free time to drive around the city doesn't mean she wouldn't have time to check in with friends or whatever else after school. For instance, she had somewhere she had to be, so going to hang out somewhere off campus or dropping someone off would lead to the possibility of traffic, getting lost, or whatever else -- maybe their friends would all know Hae was never really up for hanging out after school. But, that doesn't mean she was in a rush and running out of the school either. I dunno, it just seems obvious to me that there's a middle ground. Thinking about my own life, I used to have Debate practice after school. It would start 30 minutes after school ended, to make up for the time it took for the teacher to get his stuff together after his last class and for everyone to get settled. Even though there was a donut shop one block down the street, and a McDonald's two blocks the other way, I would have never left campus. I also lived .5 miles away, but I would never try to go home in case something came up that interrupted my plans. But, I would often hang out in the cafeteria with people waiting for other clubs/sports, and not actually go to the practice room. Maybe even go outside to someone's car, if it was nice. OR, go to the bookstore in the school where I could buy snacks and hang out with my friend who worked there. Even though I wouldn't have agreed to go anywhere with anyone because I had ""somewhere to be,"" I wasn't on a strict schedule."	20141126T151646
MusicCompany	2	0	What's also interesting about this story is that it exposes another lie. Adnan says that he thought Hae must have gone to California, which is why he wasn't worried about her when she was reported missing. But here he's saying that she wouldn't have deviated from going to pick up her cousin. So why wasn't he worried that she didn't pick up her cousin on January 13?	20141126T182256
cjtakoz	2	0	Valid point but it's tough to believe he would be seen asking his ex girlfriend for a ride on the day he planned to kill her. Unless he was much less intelligent than portrayed.	20141126T071325
We__are__Groot	1	0	But we know from the other wrestling manager that she was at school until around 3 that day. That means that she has at least 45 minutes of free time from when school gets out. Adnan's response to SK when she asks him about Hae's after school routine can not be the truth.	20141130T051546
joppy77	11	0	"Yeah, he rarely just says, ""no"" or ""yes"" in a concrete way, or just answer simply without a contrived explanation. It always feels like a slippery sales pitch to me, and there is often this kind of pandering and manipulative stuff about, ""I can understand why people would see it this way, I can, but see..."" I'd just love to hear him be concrete and sincere when he gives an answer to an important question. Sure, this all happened 15 years ago, but that means he's had 15 years to work out what he truly believes about that day. Instead, it almost always felt like he's trying to be so smooth, so charismatic, which has obviously won a lot of people over. But it feels very glib to me. Eloquent, but glib. I've always felt that when I hear him talk, even during the periods when I've leaned towards his innocence."	20141126T100317
miazia	1	0	I agree with this. And it also seems that Hae did have something that she had to do between school and picking up her cousin–she had to find Summer to tell her that she would not get on the bus and would meet her at the wrestling match. Thinking of my own high school, it was big and sprawling, it could take some time to get around and find people. So it would be conceivable that Hae would have told Adnan that she could give him a ride only to then realize that she needed to find Summer after school and that she wouldn't have time to do both.	20141127T164228
saturdaysalright	1	0	I don't think Adnan says that, if I remember correctly SK mentions that many friends didn't think it was as serious right away, then says, some of Hae's friend mention that she may have run off to CA, it doesn't explicitly say that Adnan thought that.	20141126T213209
anonymous	7	0	That is tough to believe. However, if this murder was not premeditated, it would not be difficult to believe, and it would be easy to understand why he would deny it later. Note: of course, prosecution want premeditated because it is good for them	20141126T074547
gts109	3	0	Are you saying that you don't believe he asked Hae for a ride? Three witnesses testified as much. The jury never heard Adnan's denial. You can debate what to make of that fact, I agree, but I believe it happened. Frankly, Adnan's denial is more consistent with his guilt, IMO. Why would you tell a cop that you had tried to get a ride from someone you just killed? That's even dumber than publicly asking her for a ride. You'd think someone who did it would deny trying to get access to the victim right around the time she went missing. And, that's one of the lessons of this show, I think. People are bad liars, and misremember stuff and you can't assume guilt or innocence based on small inconsistencies or that this or that statement makes no sense.	20141126T153828
MusicCompany	2	0	Episode 9, Adnan: > Yeah it was just a complete shock. No way did I, and I’m pretty sure they didn’t either, imagine that she would turn up, dead, murdered, her body would be found. So, no. I never ever considered that. I’m pretty sure they didn’t even think something bad happened, so we just kinda thought it was some, just some explanation. Hae was somewhere. With her father in California or with her new boyfriend, who knows? So, no.	20141126T214223

RichTea88	30	0	Strange. I'll state that I haven't drawn any set conclusion about who I think did it but had been chatting to my friends saying if I had to guess, I think both Jay and Adnan are involved. But just out of interest I'll create a theory where Adnan is innocent. It almost matches your explanation exactly. Here's my timeline. 32 Jay 10:45 a.m. 0:28 L651A - Adnan Calls Jay to drop off his phone and car, they're picking up weed later 31 Jenn home 12:07 p.m. 0:21 L688A - Jay calls Jenns house, he's way out by Patapso Valley at this time for some reason? 30 Jenn home 12:41 p.m. 1:29 L652A - Jay calls Jen again 29 incoming 12:43 p.m. 0:24 L652A - Jenn calls Jay back telling him to come over for some fun ;) 28 incoming 2:36 p.m. 0:05 L651B - Adnan has been out of School for only 21 minutes at this point. Hae is seen alive after this time. 27 incoming 3:15 p.m. 0:20 L651C - Jay still has the Cell phone, He recieves a call from Adnan who's at the library, along the lines of 'come pick me up for a smoke' or something. Jay by this time has killed Hae. She has spotted him around school and confronted him about cheating on Stephanie. The Cell tower shows that he was around the school at that time 'L651' is right next to woodlawn. 26 Jenn home 3:21 p.m. 0:42 L651C - Jay calls Jenn, he's in a panic because he's killed Hae but needs to pick up Adnan. 25 Nisha 3:32 p.m. 2:22 L651C - Jay has picked up Adnan for a smoke. Adnan calls Nisha for a chat since he has his Cell. He asks Jay if he can get some green for him before leaving for Track at 4. 24 Phil 3:48 p.m. 1:25 L651A - Jay Calls Phil looking for a hook up 23 Patrick 3:59 p.m. 0:25 L651A - Jay Calls Patrick looking for a hook up 22 Jenn home 4:12 p.m. 0:28 L689A - Jay calls Jenn, He's up by the park n Ride. He needs a lift from Jenn because He's just dumped Hae's Car and needs to get a lift back. 21 incoming 4:27 p.m. 2:56 L654C - Jay receives a call, he's presumably by his house by this point because the Cell location is right next to it. He's getting shovels. 20 incoming 4:58 p.m. 0:19 L654C - He receives a call from Adnan asking to pick him up from track. 19 incoming 5:14 p.m. 1:07 WB443 - Adnan has been picked up and is back with phone he calls to check his voice mail 18 # + Adnan cell 5:14 p.m. 1:07 BLTM2 - Also him checking his voicemail 17 Krista 5:38 p.m. 0:02 L653C - He calls Krista but gets her answering machine and hangs up. 16 incoming 6:07 p.m. 0:56 L655A - They're on their way to chill at Cathy's. He recives a call from Haes little brother looking for Hae 15 incoming 6:09 p.m. 0:53 L608C - Jay and Adnan are at Cathy's. He recives a call from Aisha, Haes Friend telling him about the police looking for Hae and they're going to call him. 14 incoming 6:24 p.m. 4:15 L608C - Jay and Adnan are at Cathy's still, he receives a call from the police and is pretty high. He asks his firends how to get rid of a high because he's got to go meet someone. His Dad, for Mosque. 13 Yaser cell 6:59 p.m. 0:27 L651A - Adnan makes a quick call to Yaser before getting dropped off at mosque - this cell tower is right next to the mosqu and his dad verifies that he's there that night. 12 Jenn pager 7:00 p.m. 0:23 L651A - As soon as Adnan leaves, Jay springs into action, paging Jenn to tell her he's going to dispose of the body 11 incoming 7:09 p.m. 0:33 L689B - Phone Call from Jenn - this is the cell towers by Leakin Park again. 10 incoming 7:16 p.m. 0:32 L689B - Phone Call from Jenn - this is the cell towers by Leakin Park again. 9 Jenn pager 8:04 p.m. 0:32 L653A - He Pages Jenn, He's leaving the scene, the job is done. 8 Jenn pager 8:05 p.m. 0:13 L653C - He Pages Jenn, He's leaving the scene, the job is done. but he needs to ditch the car and pick up Adnan from Mosqu in an hour. Mosque lets out at 9. Also, he's contacting Jenn a lot, and on her Pager instead of at her house. I think at this time he's ditched the car on Edmonson Ave and called Jenn to pick him up. 7 Nisha 9:01 p.m. 1:24 L651C - He's just picked Adnan up, he calls Nisha straight away. 6 Krista 9:03 p.m. 5:28 L651C - The rest of these calls are to Adnan's friends, when he has the phone he's barely off it. He's only had it a day and its his first Cell so when he has it on him he's still excited by it and is using it constantly. 5 Krista 9:10 p.m. 8:41 L651C 4 Nisha 9:57 p.m. 0:24 L651C 3 Yaser cell 10:02 p.m. 0:06 L698B - This Cell tower is next to Jays - So this is probably when Adnan dropped him off. 2 Saad 10:29 p.m. 0:18 L651C 1 Ann 10:30 p.m. 1:44 L651C	20141126T140523

However once Adnan gets 3 phone calls about Hae's disappearance at Cathy's, including the detective's, Adnan/Jay get spooked and the timeline might have got bumped up, hence the phone calls in Leakin Park only a short while after leaving Cathy's. Point is, I think it's plausible a guilty Adnan is willing to wait a couple hours at Cathy's so that he doesn't have to bury the body in the early evening.	20141126T092931
AMAathon	5	0	"These posts are basically long forms of the simple, ""If it were me, I wouldn't have done that,"" which means nothing. If *you* had killed Hae, *you* wouldn't have done that, but you are your own individual looking at all of this from a much different perspective than anyone on the ground at the time. I posted this in another thread, but you're basically trying to make sense of a senseless crime, which will never work. It's an emotional, illogical crime, and trying to pin down others' emotions and logic is impossible. There are a million different reasons that could have made them think going to Cathy's was a good idea at the time -- panic, fear, adrenaline. They have a body in the trunk, they aren't seasoned killers, reality hasn't truly set in yet, they're freaking out, one or both decides ""let's just go somewhere and chill. Let's go pretend it never happened for a while."" Does it make sense? Absolutely not. But the crime itself doesn't and the actions following don't either. It's an insane, unusual day. We have the advantage of looking back at this day from an aerial perspective. We get to see the mice in the maze, if you will. While it looks so simple to us that all they need to do is take a left at the next corner, they can only see a few feet in front of them and have to make their decision based on that. So where you'd take that left because you can see from above it leads to dumping the body, they get to the corner and ask, ""Which way should we go?"" Not so easy, is it?"	20141126T184651

lockea	4	0	A problem I have with this, and most of the 'Jay did it' theories, is that **Jay was never in Hae's car at any point**. He says this confidently over and over to the cops - he would not do this if there was any danger of forensics contradicting him. There were no forensics linking Jay to Hae's car, no fingerprints anywhere and the car was not wiped (because all the other prints remained). To explain away this within the Jay theory you'd have to argue a couple of different things * Maybe Jay wore gloves? But then it must have been a pre-planned murder and not a spontaneous one * Maybe the murder happened in a different location? Possibly, but given that Hae was rushing to get to her cousin by 3.15 I think it would have been difficult to convince her to get out of her car without good reason - it would slow her down a lot >It seems to me there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to go to Kathy's house if you need to bury a body and you both know it. They probably had a couple of reasons which have been mentioned * Need to wait until it is dark. Yes sunset was at 17.05 but it doesn't immediately go dark at sunset - it takes another hour or two to become pitch black * Need to wait for fewer people to be on the roads. *They have to take a body out of a trunk at the Park and Ride* - Park and Rides are used by commuters and so are most busy at rush hour times as people come home from work at 5-7. Plus they need to park and work undisturbed near the road in Leakin Park, which does get busy * Creating an alibi I actually think their plan was to do the burial in the early hours after midnight, but the call from the cops spooks them - they probably think a police car is about to turn up any minute - so they accelerate the plan	20141127T021900

therealjjohnson	2	0	What I don't understand in this narrative is why Jay has Adnan's car. The gift, which I understand was a bracelet, was purchased that morning with Jay & Adnan were together after he left school. Why didn't he take his car back? Why is he lending his car to Jay again after getting high while he is at track practice? Did jay ask to borrow it? If so then why hasn't Adnan said this? It doesn't make sense for these two people to not be friends yet you have him driving your car all day for no apparent reason.	20141126T214552

DrOil	1	0	What really gets me is in Episode 7 when Deirdre says that she's never had the guilty sociopath client in her many years of doing this kind of work. As in she's never has someone who killed and was able to convincingly pull off appearing innocent purely by social manipulation. Based on what we know it seems clear that Hae was either murdered by Adnan or Jay. Both are sincere and appear to be telling the truth about their innocence. One of them is lying. One of them is being manipulative. One of them is the guilty murdering sociopath. But how can that be? Deirdre has been practicing for ages. She's dug through cases like this one many times. How can she never have encountered someone capable of this while Sarah finds one on her first go-round. It's like Sarah picked up Pokemon for the first time and caught a shiny right off the bat. You know what I mean?	20141126T204049
anonymous	1	0	Picture this... The Hae's car is dumped at the I-70 park and ride after Jay kills her (with her body in it). He goes back and grabs Adnans car and uses that (I-70 to Woodlawn high isn't a far walk whatever) Later he drives Adnans car to the I-70 park and ride, jumps out and get into Haes car, drives that, burys the body then drives back to the I-70.	20141126T234132
recklesseyeballs	1	0	They are waiting until it's dark to bury Hae. It's 'killing time' in the sense that they have to wait until nightfall but I don't think anyone is stalling.

sgtthompson	1	0	"Cell towers used in court cases was new in 1999 and don't think high school students would know or even think about them when committing a crime. I speculate Hae was meeting up with Jay and another 3rd person to buy drugs. I can’t think of another reason why she would stop on the way to her cousins. Adnan was asking for a ride, because he wanted to tag along. The call the night before was to set it up and the reason why Adnan gave his car and phone to Jay. Think Hae was killed because of something she said to either Jay or this third person. The third person was probably older and more experienced and told Jay what to-do. It was mentioned that Cell Tower Pings and timelines match up after 6pm that night (About the time Jay picked up Adnan from Track). Cathy’s put the two of them together. He then took Adnan to where the body was going to be buried to wait off the high. It’s the calls from Jenn that put him in these spots and think it was planned out. Now for the heavy speculation: • Jay said he was a ""Drug Dealer"" and not a ""Weed Dealer"". Think this was Hae getting something else other than weed. • Think the third person knew Adnan, was Muslim and higher up the drug ladder. • Blaming Adnan was the backup plan. When the body was discovered, the third person placed the anonymous, untraceable call pointing to Adnan. (Fact the call wasn’t traceable points to knowledge of tracking and probably cell towers. It was actually two calls because the first one was probably running too long) • Hae probably knew more about this person than she should have from Adnan. Think Jay was with Jenn and she went off on them about Stephanie and when the third person said something, she snapped back with something she wasn’t supposed to know. Which leads to why Adnan was probably established as the escape goat for the murder. • Jay’s changing story is trying to match up where he was that day before 6pm. As the cops challenge him with cell towers he changes locations. • Adnan probably knows this third person and can’t say anything. Either because he has access to his family or knows that this person or organization would kill him anyways. Think its alluded to when he says that if he was a better Muslim and didn’t hang with these people none of this would have happened."	20141126T213224
UrnotRyan	1	0	He would need it for transportation. He could leave the car in the park and ride and bury the body without having to drive around in Hae's car or have someone pick him up in a remote, suspicious location like Leakin park	20141126T174210
brickbacon	1	0	One, Adnan likely involves Jay for a number of reasons. Two, the reticence to involve someone else equally applies to Jay as well. Why did Jay involve Jenn if you think involving someone else in such a crime is unlikely? Three, if Jay is framing Adnan from the minute the murder happens, why doesn't he do a better job of it? Jay has access to Hae's body so he could have easily left hairs or blood in Adnan's car. He could have transported Hae's body in Adnan's car. Jay has access to Hae's car, so he have easily hid her registration, keys, etc. in Adnan's car. Jay has her purse so he could have left the entire bag in Adnan's trunk. Why does the extent of the job Jay does to frame Adnan consist of telling a couple people conflicting stories beforehand where Adnan does it, then hoping the cops trust him, a Black drug dealer known to be a weirdo, more than Adnan, a seemingly normal guy, honor roll student? Especially given Jay knows Adnan was seen in public by multiple people if he is innocent. Why doesn't Jay try harder to set him up? Just speaking broadly here, I don't really know any Black people who would trust the cops, or who would feel confident with that gamble regardless of what happened.	20141126T204303
PartemConsilio	0	0	Let's suppose Adnan did it. Maybe he did it while high and Jay somehow saw it happen. Jay doesn't tell the police for a long time, so to avoid being labeled as an accessory he comes out with an outrageous story just to push himself into a sweet deal. He may not have known the cops already just wanted Adnan, so to completely cover himself he made his role larger, but still innocent.	20141126T163910

It assumes Hae knows who Jay is, and there's no evidence of that (twofold if it's true Adnan wasn't really friends with him). It assumes Jay and Hae wind up in the same place, somewhere where she must have parked her own car and been on foot, and there's no evidence of that. So, actually from the get-go you're *starting* with an assumption and using other assumptions to back that up.	20141126T183127

mailcimp	2	0	"I was watching ""conversations on the serial podcast"" with Pete Rorabaugh, and Adnan's best friend, Saad participated in one of the episodes (the third ep I believe). Pete asked him specifically why they (Saad, Adnan and Rabia) weren't super pissed at Jay back then and in the present for what Jay did and said. Saad said he thinks it was very possible that Jay was coerced by the police to give the detailed story that he did and that it's plausible it was all due to shotty detective work. For that reason, Saad sort of feels that Jay was also a victim in this, that he was forced by the cops to do what he did. I am not saying that Adnan's friend (who is clearly biased) is telling the truth or giving a completely honest answer to this question, but it does make a lot of sense.

In order to shield his family from embarrassment and to protect himself from having to own up to years of deception to his loved ones, he just keeps saying he ""doesn't know"" when asked about certain details pertaining to the case. This way, he can save his family's while serving out a sentence that he would've been pegged with if he was honest from the get-go. In a nutshell: At this point, Adnan would rather spend the rest of his life imprisoned but under the illusion of innocence than come clean about what his & Jay's roles really were in Hae's murder because he truly does care about his family."	20141203T025510

BaltimoreBlackPearl	1	0	The road is a small road, but it is a heavily traveled route that connects west Baltimore with north and central Baltimore. Importantly, the road makes it easy to access the eastern-most end of Route 70, a major highway which runs east-west but stops near the city/county line. The road through the park is one of the few roads that continues to run in a direct east-west route through western Baltimore City, and has few or no stop sign or traffic lights. I use it frequently, at all hours of the day. Usually at rush hour, but also later at night and whenever on weekends. A forecast of bad weather wouldn't have changed the route of people commuting home from work. I would say rush hour runs through 7pm at least. If the winter storm had already started that evening, then traffic on this road may have been even worse because a lot of people avoid the major highways like 95 and 695 (4 lanes of traffic with idiots driving in snow is awful and unpredictable, whereas driving the smaller roads across the city usually means one lane of cars traveling at lower speeds… slow but steady)	20141126T191823

Workforidlehands	1	0	"A question that may or may not have been asked/answered is whether Adnan was continuing to smoke at Cathy's? That could constitute a reason for going there. I would guess that keeping Adnan as stoned as possible would be a good method to ensure he's as unaware as possible of what is going on around him if Jay was acting alone. Another point that is probably somewhere in the Serial transcript is the exact point in the timeline where Jay told Jenn about the murder. Was she aware at the point she and Jay returned to Cathy's later and played down the ""suspicious"" events from earlier without elaborating on what happened? I'm puzzled by why Adnan would chose to involve Jay if he had committed the murder... and I'm equally puzzled why Jay would tell Jenn unless it was Adnan that had committed the murder (rather than the ""Jay did it"" theory.) My logic that ""murderers don't tell people"" seems to fall on this point because logically one of them must have done so."	20141126T201126

Funny thing is that >Between 8:00-8:15 p.m., Jennifer got a message from Jay to pick him up at Westview Mall in 15 minutes, so she left and picked him up in front of Value City. (2/15/00-190-192) Appellant was with him, driving, and said hello to Jennifer. Jay got in her car and said, ""I have to tell you something, but you can't tell anyone."" He said Appellant strangled Hae in the Best Buy parking lot. Jay saw her body in the trunk. He said Appellant used Jay's shovels to bury her and Jay wanted to make sure there were no fingerprints on them. Jenn did testify in court, so IF I understand correctly, the court used Jenn's testimony placing Adnan after 8:00 at the mall. The only people who said adnan WASN'T at the mosque are Jay and Jenn, who's lies are well documented in their countless and everchaning stories. Also >The next day Jennifer took Jay to F&M drugstore to get rid of clothing and boots in a dumpster. (2/1 5/00- 1 96- 198) Sounds kinda strange..

serialmonotony	11	0	A murder in the car is clearly not the only possible explanation for a broken turn signal. Other causes that I can reasonably postulate off the top of my head include a larger driver trying to squeeze into the car to move it without adjusting Hae's seat settings, or a person aggressively cleaning all controls to remove their prints after having moved the car.	20141126T133337
serialmonotony	8	0	No, not necessarily. If we don't accept Jay's account as the truth, then we don't know that she was killed in her car at all or that anyone got in her car before her death. For all we know she stopped off somewhere and met up with someone, or got into someone else's car. The killer moved her car after her death, presumably, but then he would have access to her car keys.	20141126T123010
icase81	2	0	I think the popular theory is she randomly ran into him or saw Adnans car and was like 'WTF?', went to investigate and caught him doing something he didn't want anyone (Stephanie) to know about.	20141127T021223
Irkeley	1	0	Conveniently Jay makes sure he includes all the significant, more easily tested events of Adnan's day (school, track practice, Kathys house and the Mosque), knowing he would probably have been seen there. The mosque part was taken out of his final testimony though, or was it not? I think it didn't fit with the prosecutors timeline of the burial.	20141126T162554
Workforidlehands	2	0	"A thought that just occurred to me after posting above is that my ""murderers don't tell people"" logic could still hold true if it turns out that Jenn was actually involved in the murder too and that ""telling her"" was a lie. There doesn't seem to have been enough about Jenn considering she is supposed to have also helped dispose of evidence. The thing that bugs me the most about this whole case is the anonymous phone call. It occurs 3 days after the body was found and advises to look at Adnan. This leads to the phone records subpoena which leads to Jenn, which leads to Jay which then leads back to Adnan. As they had all remained silent to this point I can't see how it was in any of their interests to be involved in making that call unless Jay was the culprit, assumed there'd be evidence leading to him and just wanted to misdirect towards Adnan. That too seems like a very risky strategy as it would place them all into the story with no clue where it could lead after a month when they didn't seem to be under any great suspicion. Otherwise who was it? I can only speculate that this ""Asian 18-21"" was in some way connected to Hae (maybe related) and was aware of the ""big secret"" relationship and was pointing the finger just based on that. Otherwise we can only conclude that a 3rd party as yet unidentified was also aware of the circumstances of the murder. The principles of logic appear to be abandoning me :-("	20141126T205901

serial_lacuna	8	0	But the same is also true for Jay. Jay would have to be a mastermind of planning this whole event, including getting Adnan's car and phone from him, making all the calls and setting the whole thing in motion, and executing all the details. But then he would also screw up all the details and consistencies with the police stories, casting his own story into doubt, and he would be risking everything pursuing this plan, considering he knew he would be charged as an accessory.	20141126T143030

This is pretty much the holiest time of the entire Islamic calendar and also conveniently a time when Adnan's dad will be surely upset if Adnan does not show up at the mosque promptly for evening prayers. * Adnan meets Jay in the morning, but rather than carefully going over the days' planned events, Adnan spends the entire morning helping Jay buy a birthday gift for Stephanie.

Obviously this is not positively the reason that Adnan called Hae, but his assertion that that was the case seems to be backed up by his new cell phone number being written in her diary (which would indicate that she was most likely home and on the phone with him when she wrote it down.)

One page was ripped out from the map. At trial they pointed out that it was the page that showed Leakin Park. The defense argued, ‘well, you can’t put a timestamp on fingerprints, they could’ve been six week-old fingerprints or six month-old fingerprints, there’s no way to tell.’ And Adnan had ridden in and driven Hae’s car many times, all their friends said so. The ripped out page showed a whole lot more than just Leakin Park. In fact, it showed their whole neighborhood, the school, the malls, probably ninety percent of where they most often drove.

jtw63017	2	0	I liked the evidentiary posts, and believe the analysis added value to the conversation. This post just seems rash. There is nowhere near enough information for an observer listening to the podcast and relying on just that information to do an analysis of the issue. I don't see the value in trying given the qualifiers that have to be added. For that reason this blog post really amounts to just idle speculation.	20141126T163835
37151292	2	0	Regarding the judge's point 2, it has been said elsewhere on this subreddit that if Adnan had confessed some information to his lawyer that would have contradicted Asia's proposed alibi then it would have been ethically difficult or even impossible for her to further develop the possibility. As a layperson I'd like to know whether this claim is accurate since if it is it seems the only alternative to incompetence is guilt.	20141126T212940

But I do think that setting forth the legal framework and commenting about what I do know adds some value.	20141126T164926
EvidenceProf	2	0	Good point, and this is true. Below is a hypothetical I give to my Criminal Adjudication students. It is based on a real case, and the answer is that the appeal was not successful. So, yes, if Adnan told his lawyer information making it impossible that Asia's accounting was true, there was no IAC: Hypothetical: During an aborted robbery attempt, cab driver Jeffrey Songer was shot in the back and died in the street in St. Petersburg, Florida. It happened after midnight on March 21, 1983. Eight months later, Derrick Tyrone Smith was convicted for Songer’s murder and sentenced to death. After he is convicted, Smith appeals, claiming that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to call 3 witnesses who would have placed him at Norm’s Bar at 11:30 P.M. on the night of the murder. The attorney claims that he did not call these witnesses because what Smith had told him and other evidence that he had discovered led him to believe that it was impossible that Smith was at Norm’s Bar at 11:30 P.M. Will Smith’s appeal be successful? See Smith v. Secretary, Dept. of Corrections, 572 F.3d 1327 (11th Cir. 2009).	20141126T213456
EvidenceProf	1	0	Yes, you are correct. My posts are in response to each episode, and I do expect that my opinion on various issues will change as I listen to more episodes. And while most of my early posts have been arguments in favor of the defense, I expect that I will also end up with a number of posts supporting the State. For instance, I'm listening to Podcast #2, which deals a lot with the prosecution's use of Adnan's religion at trial. And while there is an exclusionary rule dealing with religious evidence, I'm thinking that it didn't apply at Adnan's trial.	20141126T184707

As in, going to visit her step-father in California. Their initial reactions to me seemed to appropriately reflect high school naivete - ""Oh man, she's going to be in so much trouble when her parents find her."" As in, they never thought there was something to truly be worried about - maybe she just decided to go hang out with her boyfriend instead of going to pick up her cousin or something. Personally, I think it's more normal for them to assume the least malicious reason for her disappearance on the same day she ""disappeared,"" rather than the most malicious.

Did she have packed bags in your car?I just find it weird that people thought she was just wrapping up a normal day of school and then just going to head to California at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Especially now since people have came out and said they had spoke to her around 3 o'clock and she said she was going to meet up with them and she was going to do this issue is going to do that.

MusicCompany	4	0	Yeah, it's totally unbelievable. SK should question Adnan in detail about this. When specifically did Hae say anything about California? Did she talk about it on January 13? When? He should have a detailed memory of this if he was so sure that's where she went. Did anyone else hear her talking about it? (And yes, Adnan talked to Hae that day. He spoke to her on the phone after midnight. He spoke to her in school that morning. He had last period with her.)	20141126T165024

FingerBangHer69	-1	0	I'm the same age as Adnan. When I was in high school my friends and I were on the phone for hours everyday. Talking to girls, about girls, trying to score weed or alcohol. The Internet was new but we would meet up on aol chat rooms or IM. A few people had cell phones ( I borrowed my parents phone very often) and a lot of people had pagers. We were also using email a lot at that point. I say all that to say your title is incorrect. There was was a lot of communication going on in the late 90s. I think it's very significant Adnan did not personally try to contact Hae. He called her 3 times the night before, she disappears and he never checked on her? This is very fishy to me. Not enough to prove he did it, but it makes me wonder.	20141126T134358
mcflydom	0	0	I'm around the same age as they are, and we did use phones very heavily. I think one of the weirdest parts is that he was calling Hae after midnight several times--which would have certainly alerted her parents. If he was trying to keep things hush-hush, why was he calling so late? And why was it so important that he give her that number that night? Yet, to go back to your question, I could certainly see how he wouldn't be calling her home after the fact, but even if he thought she had gone to California, I don't understand why he wouldn't try paging her. Anyway, people didn't have texting capability back then so the easiest way to get in touch would be to call (or page). But mostly people called, emailed, or used AIM. So the sheer amount of phone calls isn't really that strange.	20141126T182102

Also, after the Deal with Jay episode, a huge majority of the threads were pro Jay. I also don't think that there is a ""hive mentality"" here. That would seem to suggest that we're all working in unison to get everyone to have the same opinion. I think it's just more that as the show goes back and forth each episode, thousands of people who have listened then react *individually*, then come here to discuss it. At that point, you will find that, *individually*, many people have come to have similar feelings or ideas. That's pretty much the way the podcast was designed.

While others think it's a contemporary In Cold Blood (how anyone is capable of doing very terrible things). I'd say it's a little of both. Serial has a lot to say about the contemporary American experience. And I wish that this forum would spend a little more time discussing the creative/storytelling/cultural/political ideas of Serial instead of a constant debate over whether or not Adnan did it.

Of course, there are those who refuse to even accept anything supporting the other side. I've actually seen people on here use the words, ""I'm all for any theory that exonerates Adnan"", which is a terrible way to go about this. And I've seen similar declarations from the ""Guilty"" side. I also think more people need to understand the distinction between ""innocent"" and ""not guilty"". For example, I'm in the weird position of being 85/15 in favor of guilt, but I don't know if I believe the state's case was strong enough for conviction. If it was, it was just barely. The timeline they presented is all but impossible. And as a juror, your job is not to go with your gut, it's to determine if the state has a case beyond a reasonable doubt. You have to consider the case in the context of the evidence you are given, nothing more. So the timeline is, again, all but impossible, and other than that, it's cell tower evidence (which is good, solid evidence for the most part, but not 100% ironclad at all), and witness testimony. Not a super-strong case. tl;dr -- I think Adnan is guilty of the crime, but not sure he should have been convicted."	20141126T172533

Of course, regardless of which side you're on, you are going to notice those against you more often so it will always seem like a lot of people are biased against you when in reality everyone gets down voted and argued against if they feel strongly enough to write anything with any substance on here. I have been on this sub since maybe week two and have remained squarely on the fence. I often post honestly about what I find to be legitimate questions that aren't necessarily playing to anyone's guilt or innocence or I sometimes play devil's advocate for either side depending on how compelling or valid I find the discussion to be for that side - this is just how I like to approach the discussion on this sub and personally find it satisfying. And I have seen a great deal of vitriol and downvotes thrown at me from both sides pretty much equally, even when my comments are merely stating facts and not even mentioning who I think is guilty or innocent. I would say that it really depends on how you approach your comment. If you are fair and admit to not knowing and not being sure of what to believe, people tend to be nicer to you. If you make a bold statement without backing it up - or back it up with your own clearly biased opinion (and I agree that it is very tiresome to have to continuously back yourself up over and over and over, ad nauseum) then yup, there will always be assholes but, eh, the internet, so it goes. People seem to like getting worked up on here but I really think for the most part through all the changing waves, this has remained a civil, fun, interesting place to talk about Serial. I've found that I just have to wade through some bullshit but it's been worth it so I'm still here. I think being on the fence also has helped me not get overwhelmed by the shifting biases.

It's odd in many ways why serial choose such a cut and dry case. There are real cases of of innocent people in prison. In saying that, Serial is immensely gripping in exploring the case. The end I think will be a bit of a let down. The circumstantial evidence all points to Adnan. I can't see any rabbits being pulled out of the hat. Still Sarah Koenig is such a brilliant reporter with such a rich mesmerising storytelling voice I'd listen to her investigating a minor car accident.	20141126T134733

No. Do I know that Jay killed Hae No. But if they were together at Kathy's at 6:00pm and Adnan says he had his cell phone after that time...it's a fact I cannot stray from. I also know that the minute you try to take one side or the other, you will be met with serious flurries of ""WHAT?"" from both camps. I guess I'm taking the side of the cell phone. The cell phone was at leakin park. I do not believe that Christine Guiterrez is that great of a lawyer nor do I think the prosecution did a great job. But the Criminal Justice in this country has never been ""fair"" it has been a system inside of a system. A language all it's own. It's political and full of people operating with agenda's.

But the reality is there are different ways to interpret the evidence, which makes the case so compelling. Only Jay and Adnan know who is guilty/innocent and I don't think that's going to change. As for me, I do lean toward Adnan being guilty. But I recognize that I really don't know, I might change my mind and it doesn't bother me if people agree with me or not.

bencoccio	3	0	Ha, it's funny - I feel the same in reverse. Actually, this sub feels a lot like the current political polarization in America to me. Seems like the folks who have been on this sub the longest have basically made up their minds. I'd like to say I'm open to new information, but that's basically the same as me saying I'm a registered independent and voting Democrat *every single time*. And the more entrenched you get, the easier it gets to be rude or dismissive or short sighted. Shit, I need to stop hanging out here. Ha, psych.	20141126T212710
MusicCompany	11	0	The sub is very polarized. It fluctuates somewhat from one episode to the next. Some episodes have produced a pro-Adnan lean, and others have produced the opposite. Right now, after episode 9, I think we're in a more pro-Adnan period. I feel like people think I'm heartless and/or idiotic for believing Adnan is guilty or thinking evidence against him means something. But I persevere, because I think that the tragedy of this podcast is that it gives voice to a guilty man. I was thinking yesterday about what it would take to convince me of Adnan's innocence. It would take something momentous. Not how he cried once or how he seemed to be behaving after she was found.	20141126T135144
anonymous	4	0	"My guess is that this is a matter of perception. When I was leaning ""guilty,"" I noticed similar views being down voted by pro-Adnan folks. Now that I'm leaning ""innocent,"" I'm more cognizant of posts that are down voted that favor Adnan. Unfortunately, I think there are some on both sides that choose to shut down discussion in this way, which is super frustrating."	20141126T143602
HockeyandMath	4	0	"People just want a good story. I think there are two competing factions of guilt. One is whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. The other is saying, ""He may be guilty, but the case against him was bad."". Do I have to believe everything the state says to believe he is guilty? Absolutely not. I think Jay's accusation against Adnan and the cell phone tower evidence is enough. People can harp on about emotions, mannerisms, and minute details, but I stick to the things people remember after 5 weeks."	20141126T145200
anonymous	8	0	The irony of a post to those who think he is guilty filled with comments from pro Adnan people badgering those same people is too much. Yes I feel if I post thing pointing towards guilt I receive ton of comments questioning my sanity or people trying to minimize or down play every single piece of evidence. The asking for a ride doesn't matter, cell towers don't matter, the note doesn't matter, the eyewitness testimony doesn't matter, the not calling doesn't matter, the sketchy posts here by those who know him here doesn't matter,,,,,,, each piece can be rationalized, it's the totality of all of it the gets me to 100% guilty.	20141126T152248
jvt1976	3	0	What drives me nuts here is any scenario exonerating Adnan is embraced as plausible while anything pointing to guilt is quickly looked at with doubt and/or ignored.	20141126T164740
ChariBari	7	0	I think the main group of extremists on the sub are the ones who refuse to believe Adnan may not have killed Hae. Most of the people here who think Adnan might be innocent or that the case against him was inadequate are still willing to admit he may have killed her. I sure haven't seen many people saying he is *definitely* innocent, but I've seen a lot of people scoffing at the idea that he might be.	20141126T162610
joapet	2	0	I think the reason for the bias is that the whole point of this show is that they are investigating the possibility that the state's timeline of events was wrong and Adnan was convicted for the wrong reasons. So yes, there is probably a huge bias towards people supporting that Adnan isn't guilty as there are so many plotholes/unanswered questions that are being picked up on. However, so many people I have spoken to IRL and online aren't decided. I think there is only a small percentage of people that are on the side of 100% guilty/innocent either way. So you might just be feeling excluded because you've definitely made your mind up! I personally want to see more digging, more evidence, but I don't think it's necessarily down to me to even hold an opinion on whether he he is guilty or not.	20141126T174919
goliath_franco	2	0	First, I think that sub is about evenly split or even more in favor of Adnan being guilty. But I do encounter a lot of people who make arguments based on what we don't know. In response, I sometimes phrase my arguments like I am being forced to make a bet: If I *have* to place a bet for a large sum of money on who is guilty, I would place my bet on Adnan. And I have no problem standing behind that.	20141128T072758
Superfarmer	4	0	"Dude I've been on this sub since Day 3. I had an open mind in the beginning. But very quickly - through the evidence in this sub, jays testimony, jays personal FB page - came to the conclusion Adnan did it. Absolutely, I think jay helped dispose the body. But strangling is a one-person job and Jay had NO motive. Motive IS important. Adnan Truthers all make up their own motives. They have scores of them. I don't know why given two people with evidence against them - people choose to villify Jay. I can only conclude its partly because he's black. And Adnan is the ""model minority"" by comparison. Those who think race doesn't play into perceptions of guilt - look no further than today's headlines. And to all the people who call jay ""shady"" - a more racist accusation I can't think of. This ""shady"" person told the cops where the car was. He remembers the day in detail. It generally matches all the important facts of the day. Finally, I've also noticed that MANY people are like us and have come to the conclusion that Adnan did it but they leave. Why stay? Idk why I even stay. i actually like this community. Pro-Adnan people stay because they are fighting a perceived injustice. But for us -where justice was basically done - there no reason to stay. And the detectives did ""above average detective work."" So most sensible people (who think Adnan did it) have moved on. Haha, as I should. Because I certainly don't feel welcome here. People have called me pathetic, condescending, a bully - Rabia even accused me of being Jay! I very nearly left at that point. But then I took it for what it was - a distortion of reality; a conspiracy theory. The same as much of the other content in this sub."	20141126T182346
Irkeley	3	0	I'm pretty sure both camps feel the same way, and I don't agree that everyone in here thinks Adnan is guilty. Otherwise we would still have Rabia here, no? The people who thinks he is guilty are just as vocal as everyone else. Right from the beginning the sub polarized as a reaction to some very strong opinions. It would be better if we could discuss things in a more open minded manner, but that didn't work out.	20141126T133856
longhair_indifferent	2	0	100% agree with you. Every thread proclaiming Adnan's innocence is upvoted to death, whereas thoughtful, well-articulated threads speculating his guilt (e.g., http://redd.it/2n87kt) can't seem to buoy above 0. What you ultimately conclude shouldn't matter; it should be purely about deduction and reasoning.	20141126T211837
anonymous	3	0	The main problem IMO is that some of us think the cell tower evidence is absurd and some of us think it's rock solid. Without it, there is no corroboration. There is only Jay with his bizarrely shifting versions of where and when he was shown a dead body for the very first time. With it, the case settles into a kind of recognizable form . .. fuzzy around the edges, but not hard to make out. I'm frankly laughing a little at the OP's sense of getting disrespected. I get called a troll & downvoted like mad routinely, almost always for asking pointed questions. (Like, *are all boyfriends equally likely to murder their girlfriends*). It's hard to imagine something that could matter less than getting downvoted at a reddit sub.	20141126T182149

The more shrill and silly Adnon Truthers get a little tiresome but I expect a bit of unfairness when I invade enemy territory and have no problem with the general hostility here. I enjoy a pro Adnan post that actually has a new point to make, rare but worthwhile. What I hate about these sites is no one is changing anyone elses mind....mostly just making passive aggressive statement at the other party.

pwitter	34	0	"agreed. also, i just want to say that the whole reason this podcast exists (SK has said from day 1) is because the state's perspective and storyline is weak. Sk has come to the conclusion, the IP has come to that conclusion and an expert detective has come to that conclusion. If you're going to use this sub to ""every time I want to post something that might show guilt, or is from the state's perspective"" people aren't going to want to engage because you're trying to push through the state's narrative that's been shown to be pretty implausible already. personally, i know i've gone head to head w/you rosseky but i really think that if you posted stuff that wasn't just rehashing the state's flawed case or showed real evidence that could point to his guilt, i'd actually 100% engage. I'm in the camp of undecided but leaning towards adnan's innocent 53%-47% but always down to change my mind if the facts warrant it. The facts don't include "" I can't judge Adnan on the limited air time he gets, etc"" because most people want discussion on things that aren't subjective and that can be agreed on by most people. Your judgment on Adnan probably would be too subjective a lens to view him through. Also, as far as subjectivity goes, the people that are 100% pro-adnan's innocent turn me off too because on the off-chance that he did it, i'm concerned that they'll spin it any which way to try to exculpate him. However, so far I haven't seen things from you that aren't: a. subjective, b. supporting huge parts of the state's narrative that are incorrect/flawed. That's probably why people are harsh."	20141126T140447

BearInTheWild	2	0	I think the problem is there isn't any narrative that ties all that evidence together cleanly. Of course there isn't a clean narrative the other way either. So unless this becomes a simple, clean case in light of a smoking gun showing he did or didn't do it, we'll all continue to fill in the blanks with emotional perspectives on what's actually before us. The strongest evidence of this is the swing in the polls and discourse after the Jay and Adnan episodes. Those were mostly humanizing episodes with little additional fact (I don't think anyone really believed the Best Buy timeline by the Adnan episode.). It seems the swings were very emotional and not really based on evidence. For example, I look at the same evidence you mentioned and think some of it is absolutely meaningless (not calling/note). Maybe it isn't, who knows. I do know if I thought he was guilty by now, I would think that evidence is just additional confirmation he did it rather than meaningless. Either way as long as the discourse is based on actual facts and isn't personal against others, I think it's all good in the hood.	20141126T220634

In my mind jay was a white guy that I pictured looking like the guy in the scumbag Steve meme. In fact I think finding out he was black made him more sympathetic to me. Like instead of being an entitled prick who was unwilling to take responsibility for his actions, he was a young man with a hard life and legitimate reason to mistrust and lie to the cops. That being said I still think Adnan is innocent.	20141128T014420

Workforidlehands	1	0	"One thing that puzzles me is in relation to the ""shifting versions"" by Jay. When SK approached this she first listed what she described as minor discrepancies but then focused on the major discrepancy about the change to the location of where Adnan first showed Jay Hae’s body in the boot. Her argument was that you wouldn’t forget such an event so what was the reason behind the change of location. This is a perfectly logical question. What really puzzles me is her list of minor discrepancies – one of which was the change from having nothing to do with the burial to helping to dig the hole. To me this is an even more massive discrepancy and I simply couldn’t understand why she focussed on where you first saw the body above and beyond whether you actually dug a grave or not. I’m not drawing any conclusions from it; I’m just very puzzled by it – simply because I’m more likely to get confused about where I was as a certain event happened than I would be about whether something as disturbing as digging a grave actually happened at all.

The micro-inconsistencies of real life are exposed and heralded as case-breaking flaws. Gotcha! Your milk this morning was *skim!* -- and an illusion of progress in the narrative is maintained.

People are not ""implying"" he committed premeditated murder...they are saying it. And he was found guilty of it. Do I believe it? IDK.

If there is a retrial of some sort I do think that Jay will be an even more compelling witness than before when he was you g. Adnan will have to face his nemesis again.

I've met people like Adanan--not killers, but smooth talkers who get away with sh*t because people are gullible. I can't know in advance what it would take to be convinced of his innocence. I'd assess any evidence on a case-by-case basis. It's not going to happen though. I could ask you the same questions: what did it take for you to be convinced of his innocence? What will it take for you to be convinced of his guilt?	20141126T142348
walkingxwounded	9	0	It's not like the police officers really explored many other options, tho. They decided on Adnan and doggedly pursued that without really doing much to look at other suspects. They didn't even test DNA of anything found near her body. They didn't give Jay a lie detector test. They didn't search his home, or Jenn's, two people who had a significant involvement as well. They decided on who they wanted to accuse and they pointed all their evidence that way and molded the evidence to fit that. Of course there is no case against anyone else because they never really explored any other possibilities. Look, I am not saying Adnan is innocent. I think it's pretty likely that he had something to do with this, and as personable and charismatic as he seems, I think he definitely was more at play than he will admit. However, the case against him was not strong and I don't believe he should have been sentenced to life in prison for it, and that's a sentiment a lot of these expert lawyers/investigators seem to believe - and not just on the Serial podcast, but even in other places. The Slate specials are pretty anti Adnan, but even lawyers they've dragged out have said that the state's case was not strong enough and they didn't agree with the conviction. The Innocence Project took this case on for the same reason. My point is, I guess, that he can be not guilty in court but still guilty of the crime. From what we know so far, I don't believe he should have been found guilty. Aside from that, I'm not sure what else you expect on this site, tho. People are going to have strong opinions and they're not going to be swayed, and most of them are not going to be open to exploring or looking at it from another point of view. This post isn't going to change that, and people are going to experience this whether they are pro or anti Adnan. It just comes with the territory	20141126T164017

cruelfate	1	0	I believe matters may become worse for Jay. This rather formidable [detailed analysis of cell phone records and testimony by a GW law alumni](http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/23/serial-a-comparison-of-adnans-cell-phone-records-and-the-witness-statements-provided-by-adnan-jay-jenn-and-cathy/) is a thing to be reckoned with. Sorry .. it's a lot to chew through. While that that blog post linked to Rabia's blog, I'm sad that there wasn't a link to [the entire document of Jay's statement](http://www.splitthemoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Interview-with-Jay-Wilds-redacted2.pdf), which was surprisingly provided by Rabia, as I interpreted it's contents otherwise. I do wonder how events would have unfolded were Jay's plea deal had been handled differently. From what I discern from [the appeal document](https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-PUUcby-AZWfEhcuW/2002_WL_32510997_djvu.txt) (IANAL), the first jury was unaware of complete details of Jay's plea regarding his accessory to the crime. There's that, and the subsequent leniency in his sentencing that gave the case a _bad smell_.	20141130T041759

And here I thought we were going to have a respectful conversation! >the question are all boyfriends equally going to murder their girlfriends is stupid It's really not stupid. There's a valid reason that prosecutors look first at the boyfriend when a woman is killed -- because, sadly, it's a thing for some men to kill their wives and girlfriends. However. The fact of a murdered woman doesn't change the likelihood that any individual guy is guilty. It just places him in one population that contains the very small group of men who actually have killed their intimate partners. What I take issue with is people who say that Adnan definitely had a motive to kill Hae Lee. My position is that being an ex makes him a suspect, based on statistical data, but no way no how gives him *personally* a motive.	20141126T203839

anonymous	13	0	I'm leaning to Adnan being innocent. But I do think the prosecution's case is falling apart and based on the new evidence and new witnesses, I believe he would have been found not guilty if he were tried today. Try this as a thought experiment. Assume Adnan is innocent and look at the prosecution's case. Hae could not have been killed prior to 2:30 as multiple witnesses saw her up to 3pm. And now there are witnesses that saw Adnan dressed for track practice at 3pm. If he went to track he was unavailable to be part of the murder until 5pm and Hae was likely already dead by then. The cellphone towers have been shown to be unreliable. (I saw a post that showed where everyone agrees where the phone was, but the closest tower did not ping.) There is no physical evidence tying Adnan to the killing whereas Jenn and Jay admit involvement including disposing of dirty clothes and wiping fingerprints from shovels. I think the issue is that the pro-Adnan camp are coming from the place that he's innocent and the prosecution can't prove his guilt. And the anti-Adnan camp are coming from the place that he's guilty until he proves his innocence. Proving innocence is incredibly difficult.	20141126T144905

Many of us are grappling with the ""who else did it then"" question, but I think a lot of us can somewhat comfortably conclude that the state's case probably shouldn't have removed reasonable doubt. The interview of the juror made it sound like she was waiting for Adnan to prove he was innocent which is all kinds of wrong."	20141126T144345
hazyspring	2	0	"I agree with some points you make. The main reason I am undecided is because there is no explanation as to who else did it. A person unconnected to Jay seems like a stretch. I am not at the point where I can believe gross police misconduct, and that is what would be needed for Jay to not have been involved in any way. I don't see a motive for Jay to kill Hae. On the other hand, I do strongly believe that there is reasonable doubt for Adnan, I do believe in ""innocent until proven guilty,"" and the state's theory makes absolutely no effing sense. I was on a jury where I thought the person was guilty (it was a stabbing) but my other jurors felt strongly there was reasonable doubt, so we ended up not convicting. So, I understand how this feels. Someone needs to explain to me why Jay and Jenn lied so many times. One of the biggest things to me on evidence of Adnan's guilt, is that multiple people heard him ask Hae for a ride, and then change his story. But, I need more than that."	20141126T164851
rosseky	-7	0	I did read what you said, you don't seem to understand your point, though.

GoodMolemanToYou	7	0	"This may come as a surprise to you, but I've listened closely to the show and read all of the supporting documentation on Reddit and elsewhere. Sorry, but the parts of Jay's testimony that can't be corroborated are all but worthless to me. Yes, he demonstrated his involvement and knew where Hae's vehicle was. He also has told at least three wildly different stories, and a fourth to Chris that would suggest it was a crime of passion. So, sorry, but a known and proven liar claiming that Adnan was planning on killing Hae is not compelling evidence to me at all. Also, there are a million different ways to demonstrate that Jay's details of the story are not credible, so I don't think the jurors really had a clear picture of who they were hearing from. This is a big failure on the part of the defense. You can argue semantics and my use of the word imply, but I was paralleling the structure to the message I was responding to for effect. We all know he was convicted. Using that fact itself as ""evidence"" of his guilt is tautological. Each new episode brings up something the jury didn't hear or was never asked to consider. And SK has introduced enough doubt to make for a compelling program, which would suggest that the facts of the case were far less cut and dry than a 2 hour deliberation would indicate. And whether he asked Hae for a ride or not is no indication of premeditation. He could have been looking for a way to force a conversation with her about their relationship... none of us know, at all. We also have several witnesses and Adnan himself saying he didn't get a ride from her. Does that mean anything to you? Because none of those facts mean much of anything to me."	20141126T173655

8shadesofgray	3	0	I don't have a legal background, so I may be way off-base in this assessment, but it has struck me that Jay has been untruthful not only frequently but in ways that are really material ... Substantial changes over at least 6 on-the-record accounts of the day (and another to Jenn and another to Chris), changes in primary locations including the initial place he first saw a corpse, calls he placed to someone's house while he claimed to be at that person's house, changes in whether he first heard Adnan's intent that day or 4 days prior, changes in descriptions of key comments made by Adnan about nature and location of the crime ... These seem like they're actually really core to the case. I think it's natural that his story would shift out of forgetfulness or self-preservation. I think I'd accept him as a good corroborating witness or character witness. But I'm less convinced that his testimony alone reads like something that it should form the very core of the state's case (at least in my admittedly layman's mind).	20141126T164523

The user in that thread (mcqueensomething) is the one who started off saying something really rude about Rabia even though the topic (which i posted) was just a link about her faith and her journey. It was not a thread expressing facts either way or a discussion of a particular theory. YOU chose to stick up for this person instead of conceding that in that thread, they were saying something inflammatory and rude just for the sake of it (go ahead and look at that thread- other users also stated mcqueen was being rude for no reason.) That thread is neither the place nor the avenue to come and talk about adnan's guilt. go do it on the other 1000 threads about theories for why he did it. The one about Rabia's journey and faith is not the platform for it and yes, i stand by it. They shouldn't have been commenting about murder and guilt in that particular thread. It wasn't the place for it. And I don't understand how you can stick up for that. You told me to stop discussing something on a LINK I posted and wanted to share with the community which had NOTHING to do with innocence or guilt. It was just ""hey, here's this post by the woman who's been struggling these 15 years to give AS a platform and this what her journey's been.""

anonymous	14	0	I haven't exhaustively analyzed Jay's testimony like some people have, but as I was listening to the first 8 episodes, nothing really stood out to me as a major inconsistency. From my understanding, he's consistent on the major parts of his testimony - that Adnan killed Hae, how Adnan did it, that Adnan asked him for help burying the body, etc. - and the inconsistencies relate to issues that are pretty collateral. He was obviously part of the murder, since he knew where Hae's car was, so what's the other possibility? That he and Adnan killed Hae together? In that case, Adnan is still guilty. That Jay killed her on his own? Why? There's no motive and there is corroboration for Adnan's involvement in the crime. So really, it seems that simple to me. If you're asked half a dozen times over the course of months about things that happened months ago, you're going to conflate some times. You may lie about other things, or say something you're not sure about simply to please the people that you're talking to. But is there any reason to doubt the core of his testimony - that Adnan killed Hae and that Jay helped bury the body? Not really, in my opinion. For reference, every witness will have inconsistencies at trial. In every case I've ever tried, even ones where we knew the Defendant was guilty because of a suppressed confession or other suppressed evidence, we still had to address minor vs. major inconsistencies. Sometimes people mistake the date of the crime itself! Other times its things like - who arrived at the car first, what time it happened, how far away they were from the accident, which police officer arrived first, etc. So while Jay's testimony has some larger issues that would be difficult to handle at trial, and may suggest that he was fabricating part of what happened, that is not in and of itself a reason to doubt him when he says that Adnan killed Hae (IMO.)	20141126T171731
anonymous	16	0	What people are doing on this site is what defense attorneys want jurors to do during deliberations - lose the forest for the trees. Did Jay potentially lie or make mistakes during his testimony? Sure, that's possible. But that doesn't make him not credible on the key issue at trial, nor does it make Adnan innocent. The question is, do you believe him when he tells you that Adnan killed Hae? And do you believe that Adnan killed Hae? Does common sense tell you that Adnan killed Hae? That's the forest that you can't miss for the trees. As that former detective, now defense witness stated - there's going to be holes in any explanation of a crime, barring a complete confession. Witnesses can make mistakes, they can fill in gaps in their memory with events that didn't actually happen or which have only a foot in the door of truth, but at the end of the day you don't put them on the stand if you don't believe them to be credible on the issues that matter. You also don't put them on the stand unless you believe in the defendant's guilt. In fact, I've seen many times when defendants correct the judge during plea allocution - no it wasn't just his wallet, I also took his phone and keys... no, it wasn't at that intersection, it was one block over - it happens all the time. I think that Adnan is a sympathetic character, so it's natural to think he isn't a murderer. A lot of people came forward saying he was a nice guy - then again, a lot of people thought that Ariel Castro was a nice guy as well. Frankly, we have the mentality that criminals are these machiavellian figures, constantly living a life of crime and evil with no attractive qualities, when the reality is quite the opposite. Even a guy who does horrible, violent home invasions on a regular basis can be polite, intelligent, charming and charismatic to people who know him. Even that guy has a family that love him and trust him and would never say that he is a criminal. I think a retrial would depend entirely on the jury that you get. Older people with families tend to be the best for the prosecution, while young liberals tend to be better for defense attorneys, since they are more skeptical of police and more likely to think that they are more intelligent than anyone else in the room (that leads to strong opinions and entrenchment during deliberations - also, please note that I consider myself very liberal, if not so young anymore!) Of course, publicity would be a huge issue. Also, the current political climate is more anti-police and anti-prosecutor than it has ever been during my tenure. People were much more willing to trust police officers and prosecutors 15 years ago then they are now!	20141126T170002

It's one thing to say that he's on the suspect list and a whole 'nother thing to say he had a motive. When I ask if every ex-bf is equally likely to commit murder, that's what I'm trying to get at . . . clearly they're NOT.

anonymous	1	0	I would agree that most people started the podcast with an open mind. However, I find that most people (me included) think that if someone is in jail for murder, they must have done SOMETHING wrong to get there.	20141126T145748

Again, I'm not saying I believe 100% that Adnan is innocent, but we will have to agree to disagree if you don't think the prosecution's version of events and Jay's credibility have been obliterated. The only point that holds water is the timeline. They presented the cell tower data as evidence to support witness testimony. They used the witness testimony to support their case and didn't use the information that might might their case less clear. Obliterated? You are delusional. All this doubt has not disproved any of the evidence against Adnan. The only way you can say that is too believe that jay had been lying about way more. What evidence do you have for that? Because there is ACTUAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH! Try to understand you are being swayed by the way the story is being told.	20141126T160149

SK so far is so firmly in Adnan's corner that I doubt she'd conclude Adnan was guilty unless there was a video of Adnan killing Hae, with two forms of government ID for both of them, a police officer there to verify the whole thing, 5 of SK's buddies AND Dana there taking notes, and Adnan's mother there to confirm his identity.

anonymous	1	0	"Fair enough. I think I was of similar mind for the first episode or two. But I've since realized that, say, her reflections in interviews aren't enough to amplify the momentary hesitations in the podcasts to anything other than brief sanity-checks. I have perhaps an over-simple ""read"" of SK. She presented Adnan as this affable, capable, introspective young man, who was beloved at school and is a prized citizen of his prison. Things that complicate his case are ""bad for Adnan"", things that exonerate him. Most of the reporting has been about poking holes in the case and the testimony it contains. There's a nearly irresistible plot arc of the case that put him in prison disintegrating as we listen. That's reinforced by myriad contemporary interviews of people testifying that the Adnan they knew could never do it. Meanwhile, those who are more confident that he's a murderer are presented as shady, hidden, inexplicable, irrational. Sarah Koenig may very well have genuine, substantive doubts, but the story she's telling doesn't reflect them."	20141126T203741

And this 'worst ever' seems to be not only worthy of a podcast - not on the basis of being the worst, lamest, idiotic guilty convict - but because the producers thought there was doubt. And then, instead of being laughed to the bottom of the pile because it is so obvious this was the stupidest murderer ever and the most clear cut case in history, it turns into the most successful podcast ever.

Do you believe that defendants never falsely confess for all kinds of reasons -- the most common of which is police/detective manipulations, pressure, deceit, and pressure? Are you familiar with all of the Chicago ""confessions"" over some decades that have been conclusively refuted and suppressed retroactively on the basis of systematic detective misconduct in forcing false confessions?

All the accusations about jay on this site, all of them with no evidence, are kind of sickening when you think of it that way.	20141126T151202
anonymous	1	0	IDK, I didn't think that. I definitely was along for the he's totally innocent *Thin Blue Line* wrongful conviction style story. In the beginning we only heard from Rabia, Adnan, and Asia, and it was easy to feel like this was a story of the justice system failing.	20141126T150056
rosseky	4	0	They have others witnesses. They have letters and journal entries. Jays testimony gave them evidence that was proven true by corroboration. He knew where the car was. This stuff can all be explained away in a vacuum. Each individual thing may have another explanation, but taken together they forum a very compelling case. You have to take it all in. Try listening to everything again from the point of view that Adnan is lying and suddenly all the confusion disappears. He is the cause of the confusion.	20141126T150802
perchanches	3	0	"the prosecution showed that adnan had a motive, told their star witness jay his intention to kill, wrote on a note that he is going to kill, has no legitimate alabi for the entire day, was at least partially controlling and/or obsessive, had a witness say they saw the body, helped bury it, led police to the car they could not find, and corroborated this with cellphone records and tower data which put adnans phone where the eventual body was found. noone else had a motive or any evidence linking them to give reasonable doubt as to Adnans innocence. If jay loved stephanie so much that he would kill hae, why would he cheat? if it was a serial killer how did jay know where the car was? if it was drug/gang connections to small-time drug deal Jay how does that makes more sense than the most recent obsessive ex-bf? just because some of the timeline stuff seems to not match up 100% it still does not explain away any of the facts that adnan has NO alibi whatsoever and still corroborates many of the key allegations. The frustrating part about this subreddit is that the ""Adnan is innocent"" people appear to be championing adnans acquittal on some sort of technicality other than provide a real rational explanation or give any compelling evidence that would suggest ANYONE other than Adnan was the MOST LIKELY killer."	20141126T152227

gts109	5	0	It's not the defense's burden to show who else did it. That's right as far as it goes. Because of the peculiarities of this case, however, there's really only one other possible killer, and it's Jay. Once the state puts on a persuasive case, and convinces the jury that Adnan did it, the only thing that is going to create genuine doubt in their minds is plausibly showing how Jay did it. I think that that case might have been possible to make, based on the cell records, but it would have required expert testimony and some new fact witnesses who could back up an alternate storyline. That never materialized. I don't think it ever will either (unless some new forensic evidence is discovered).	20141126T154918

I may be misreading, but statements like ""try to understand you are being swayed by the way the story is being told"" seems a little paternalistic to me. Is it possible we're being swayed by the narrative? Of course. But I think it's an unfair characterization to suggest that we're categorically being ""swayed"" if we have doubt of guilt or believing that the prosecution offered up an insufficient amount of evidence or that Jay's credibility or shifting testimony is material. And it certainly seems unfair to want a forum for expressing your perspective without feeling attacked by those who disagree with you ... When you're calling people who disagree with you ""delusional""."	20141126T170921
randomchars	3	0	I contend that you have it the wrong way around. The witness statements were used at trial as evidence to support the cell phone records. It's a crucial difference. The cell phone records tied the whole case together for the prosecution and you can see how the Jay's evidence has been 'massaged' for want of a better word, to match the cell records. The real question is not whether Adnan is innocent or not. I don't know the answer to that and I'm struggling to think of anyone else who could be involved. The real question is whether Adnan should have ever been convicted on the case that the state presented. On that, the alignment of witness evidence and cell phone records doesn't really stand up to scrutiny - neither then, nor with what comes to light in this series and reasonable doubt should have been a no-brainer in this case. I agree that Adnan has no alibi, however he is not obliged to give one either. Maybe that was a poor choice, I don't know. But even in the absence of a presented alibi at trial reasonable doubt should have been found on the prosecutions case alone.	20141126T184900

I just don’t see it. Not one person says he was acting strangely after they broke up. He and Hae, again by all accounts were still friends. He was interested in other girls. He was working at his job. He was headed to college. About two weeks after his arrest, he gets an orientation packet from the University of Maryland. I don’t think he was some empty shell of a kid who betrayed his family and his religion and was now left with nothing and conjured up a murderous rage for a girl that broke his heart. I simply don’t buy it. And the reason I don’t buy it is because no one who knew him, then or now, says that’s how it was.* The only person who has ever said that Adnan wanted to kill Hae for breaking his heart is the guy who knew where her car was, where she was buried, and how she died.	20141126T225528

I'm all for checks on our judicial system, but this is not a blatant misuse of the court system. This comes across to me as people who are really worried that this is going to happen to them. You would need someone to murder your ex significant other right after you broke up with them. This is not likely. This is what makes everything more suspicious. It colors the evidence and it had to. That's how this works and if it wasn't you would never be able to convict without a signed video of the act itself.	20141126T153853
VictoriousEgret	2	0	Hae's Note: I agree. Failure to call Hae: There could be any number of reasons for his failure to call Hae.

Inability to Recall Detail: This is a 17 year old kid who, at the time, wasn't thinking about himself as a suspect in a murder trial. I could just as easily claim that because he had found out his ex girlfriend had died, all else of that day just wasn't anywhere near as important.	20141126T222240
platorithm	13	0	I am leaning towards Adnan being guilty. I definitely believe it was either Adnan or Jay, and I see too many holes in the theories presented so far that Jay did this on his own and framed Adnan. So look, we probably agree on this. But I completely disagree with your view that Adnan should be convicted because there were no better stories. That's not how the justice system is supposed to work, and logic like that is where it breaks down. The prosecution's timeline has been pretty thoroughly debunked. That was their case. Since I don't believe the prosecution's timeline after nine episodes, I have reasonable doubt. It's up to the prosecution to present a case/timeline that removes reasonable doubt for someone to be sent to prison, and I don't believe this has been done. Yep, that means people we think are probably guilty might go free, but we can't convict based on feelings or lack of better stories.	20141126T163104
ilovecherries	10	0	Let's be specific: there is no physical evidence of Adnan's guilt. It's all based on assumption that Jay's testimony is truthful and accurate. If you don't make that assumption, all evidence is pure speculation.	20141126T164459
rosseky	-2	0	So it either never materialized because the state failed to do is job, over committed to pinning the case on an innocent kid, and never suspected jay.

And the only reason I have been given to discount it is because people really want Adnan to be innocent. Either because they like him, or because it's a better story.

GotAhGurs	2	0	I don't think you get what I am saying. I'm not saying anything necessarily about Adnan. I'm saying that your logic is flawed. I'm saying that, generally, if the best thing you can say about your position is that it is not impossible (or even not unlikely), then you're in a really weak spot. You should be able to say about your position that there is evidence things DID happen the way you see them. Not just a lack of evidence that things DIDN'T happen the way you see them. It's the whole you can't prove a negative thing.	20141127T173739

platorithm	5	0	"Yes, the state is proving that he killed her at 2:36 in the Best Buy parking lot. That is the state's case. If it can be shown that Hae was talking to Summer at school at 2:36, you cannot then say ""well, he probably just killed her later, convict!"" As my post above says, I lean towards Adnan being guilty, but I disagree with you that he should have been convicted if the state's case is shown to be deeply flawed. We can't make assumptions and fill in details ourselves if the state's timeline is wrong. Convictions can't be made on overall feelings of guilt if the details don't work out."	20141126T164406

SheriffAmosTupper	2	0	"I think there are other potential indicators of sexual assault aside from the presence of sperm, and these indicators were not present. I think that's the most straightforward way to interpret her statement that I quoted. She had access to everything in the file (including, I would have to assume, the coroner's report). I'm thinking that it wouldn't come up in court documents if it wasn't a disputed issue. Sounds like everyone accepted that she wasn't sexually assaulted. She did mention that the test came back negative for sperm, but she didn't say that was her basis for saying there was no evidence of sexual assault. I think the Innocence Project wants to test for DNA because that's their best bet at exoneration, regardless of whether there was evidence of sexual assault. They also appear to think seriously that it could be a serial killer, even though there are some pretty real reasons that is highly unlikely. It's their job. I've worked with these kinds of organizations before on a pro bono basis (I don't want to say who exactly because even though they sometimes drove me nuts, I admire what they do), and let's just say that things don't have to be reasonable or realistic. They have a specific mission and ideology, and inefficiency or a high likelihood that something is a waste doesn't really seem to enter the calculus (in contrast to how a paying client makes decisions). That being said, I think you are entitled to your skepticism and to hold open the possibility. Just explaining the basis for the understanding that she wasn't sexually assaulted. EDIT: OK, here's the relevant part of Episode 7: >Finally, Deirdre and Katie and Mario were all confused by the swabs that were taken from Hae’s body. The medical examiner had done what’s known as a PERK kit, it stands for Physical Evidence Recovery Kit. It’s a standard procedure in a rape case, but it is also done in some murder cases. **There was no evidence Hae was sexually assaulted, but they did the swabs just the same. The medical examiner’s report says they came back, “negative for spermatozoa.”** But that’s about it which seemed very thin to Deirdre, these swabs weren’t examined more thoroughly, that they were never tested for DNA. [bolding not in original, obviously] Sorry for the lengthy excerpt, but here again, I think Sarah's wording indicates she's not basing the ""no evidence of rape"" on the lack of spermatozoa. She says even though there was no evidence of rape, they did the PERK, which ended up finding no spermatozoa anyway."	20141126T185619
rosseky	1	0	But there is evidence that Adnan was overly attached, and showed stalking behavior. There was evidence that he killed her as well, unless you discount witness testimony. You are discounting parts of the case and then saying that the case doesn't make sense. You can have doubts about Jays testimony, but there is not reasonable doubt to discount it. The important parts are consistent, and backed up with other evidence.	20141128T001135

I'm not even sure how phoning a friend 3 times is supposed to be evidence to implicate someone in a murder so I can't really defend that one. The asking for a ride thing can't really been proven and again doesn't prove murder. Cellphone in the park - the cell towers gave proven to be pretty questionable, and his guilt is not the only explanation for it. I'm pretty new to the sub so I haven't seen how discussion is always conducted, but I honestly don't mean any disrespect when I say that the strong reaction you get from people might be because what you are defining as ""proof"" doesn't really stand up to scrutiny. And when you are condemning someone to life in prison the standard of evidence should be much higher than what you are providing.

Irkeley	2	0	I don't feel like I have anything real to build my conclusion on, so I honestly don't know who killed her. Had the testimonies been truthful that's one thing, or if the physical evidence had been tested. At least if we knew for sure how she was killed (manually, rope, blunt object (and raped?)), or where, or what time. I don't see Jay or Adnan having alibis for the time she went missing, but they were both in the area she was last seen. Both before and after she went missing. I'm not ruling out Jay, because he admitted to being part of it, but I'm not convinced he is telling the truth. So, this is were I stand, I would not convict Adnan.	20141126T145713
UrnotRyan	1	0	But you could make similar claims (without physical evidence) of half a dozen other theories, the debate on here can attest to that. By your standard of evidence these are all equally valid. This particular scenario is only more convincing if you start with the assumption of guilt and bend the details to conform with that theory.	20141201T203044

JellyfishSandwhich23	5	0	Does anyone know if there has been any information that's come out about the 6:59 call to Yaser? This is interesting to me. Adnan (presumably) makes that call and then the only outgoing calls for the next two hours are to Jenn's pager. Adnan (presumably) then calls Nisha at 9:01. Since Hae is supposed to have been buried in that two hour window it seems finding out what that call might have been about would be pretty important (keeping in mind that on the Adnon-is-guilty model this is also during the time Adnon is supposed to be freaking out about the police coming to see him). I've been listening/ lurking here for a long time and haven't heard a thing about it. Just curious.	20141127T020918
pitydfoo	4	0	Adnan called Yaser at 6:59, just before the alleged Leakin Park burial (approx 7:10). Hypothetically, this could have been to ask Yaser to cover for him at mosque, since Adnan knew he'd be late (due to the burial). Jay could have been present for this phone call, and thus known that Yaser was someone who could sorta corroborate Adnan's involvement in the crime.	20141127T030423
ThisbeMachine	10	0	"Yeah, I thought it was really weird that in his police interview, Yaser was asked ""If Adnan was going to hurt Hae, where would he have ditched the car?""

That seems so insane! It's also possible that the cops kept harassing Yaser until he gave them some kind of answer, even though he was just picking spots at random.

Answering the question, ""Hey man, if you were going to rob a bank, how would you do it?"" doesn't mean you have the intention of robbing a bank. It's answering a question regarding a hypothetical scenario. I don't think you can really look at Adnan having a hypothetical 'burial spot' as conclusive proof that he was going to murder Hae or that he'd thought about it. Especially when we look at the fact that the car wasn't buried in a lake. We don't even know how the whole conversation went down. Sure, if the question was asked and he immediately, and with no hesitation, had an answer ready then that's a bit weird. But it's a bunch of kids sat around, getting high and asking stupid questions to each other... Can we really use those moments to establish a motive for murder? I honestly couldn't.

DirtyThi3f	10	0	"Some context: I'm a psychologist who works with adolescents and young adults. I do therapy, but I specialize in personality and pathology assessment. I used to work in forensics (now private clinical work), where I did assessments and research on jury manipulation, predictors of violence, and interrogation techniques. Got stabbed at the office and decided to leave forensic work. Disclaimer: I have no further info than any listener. I've been listening as entertainment and nothing I'd say on reddit is intended to be clinical interpretation or expert opinion on the case itself. Now my thoughts! I was miffed when I heard the judge use this characterization. It's inflammatory and not based in the reality of having worked with some severely ill adolescents. I have heard prosecutors use this term as a descriptor and parents as well, but it's amazing how often it's used to basically be the equivalent of (1) these teen lies (surprise!) and (2) is a dick (also surprise!). It does sound likely that Adnon is a pretty socially intelligent individual. But that's far from a master manipulator. That requires more insight than 99% of people have, let alone teens. Teens are inherently egocentric and that trait at an extreme can lead to narcissism. But narcissism is counter intuitive to master manipulation much of the time, as narcissists have empathy issues and a master manipulator MUST have remarkable talents in this regard. Can a narcissist be manipulative? Yes, but it takes experience and as teens they are generally just douches (not a clinical phrase!). I've yet to meet a ""master manipulator"" in adolescence. I have met them in adulthood, but even they have flaws that a good exam will catch. In adolescence they are just not sophisticated enough. They sure can attempt to manipulate to get what they want, but it's hilariously superficial once your not emotionally attached to the situation (like parents and friends can be), which can make people a bit blind to intentions. Now, has he acquired this skill over the last 15 years? Quite possibly, it could be a good survival skill in prison. But as a 17 year old? Not likely. Just my two cents."	20141126T174001

No pay phone at best buy 6. Witness claiming that Hae was at school at the same time the prosecution say she was murdered 7. Jay not serving any jail time because of his plea deal do I need to continue? I think you might have a fundamental misunderstanding of the US court system. Trials aren't structured for ALL the facts to come out. Its an adversarial system, in which two sides provide narratives and one side wins out. If the defense fails to poke holes in the prosecution's narrative (using facts that the prosecutor withholds),...then the judge and jury will never hear ALL the facts. Don't assume that jury/judge heard everything. Hence my statement that we've probably heard more than they have. One more thing....just because the trial went on for weeks,..doesn't mean they heard more regarding the most salient facts. As SK mentioned, they spent an entire week on the minutia of cell tower technology. So a lot of what they heard was probably not terribly illuminating or informative. And last point,..there are countless people who've been wrongly convicted of crimes. They were all convicted by juries and sentenced by judges who were convinced of their guilt. So Adnan's judge/jury being convinced his guilty means zilch to me.	20141126T231019
Drapetomania	2	0	"Basically my mother and I got into a fight over my atheism, I pushed her on the couch in an argument, to scare me she called the cops to teach me a lesson, I ended up in house arrest for months despite needing to get out of the house more, not less, to deal with my social anxiety, and the judge talked about my attitude towards women which was frankly kind of bizarre since nothing like that ever came up, I had a completely clean record, and given the circumstances... There was Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde podcast episode where a judge talked about a guy, how after conviction, he was clearly faking symptoms, when in the end it turned out he had Huntington's disease. It's just something they do. You should hear the episode on TAL about ""tough love"" to see what sort of shit judges can say or do."	20141127T154516

darncats4	1	0	There is testimony they heard which we have no idea what was said. Don testified and do we have any idea what he said about Hae's state of mind or Adnan's demeanor. Also in the appellate brief mention is made of Hae's friend Debbie saying that Adnan told her he thought Hae was cheating on him with Don. Have we heard that in the podcast? I can bet you the jury heard it. I'm sure there is more. There is no way that nine hours of cherry picked facts (and let's face it a whole lot of these minutes is Adnan blathering on and on) can compare with two or three weeks of testimony. And when I say cherry picked I mean for maximum suspense. I'm sure by the end of it we will have most of the important facts and testimony or so I hope.	20141127T063755

Frosted_Mini-Wheats	7	0	"One of the biggest ""missing pieces"" for me has always been an explanation of Jay and Adnan's true relationship. Adnan hands over his car & new phone to a guy he claims he barely knows. It doesn't add up. I've always thought there had to be more and the only thing I could think was of was drugs. What if Jay proposes to Adnan that if he lets Jay use his car (someone says Adnan was known to let others use his car;perhaps Jay knew that & that's why he went to Adnan with his idea), he'll keep him supplied with weed, put gas in the car, etc.? And going further out on this totally speculative limb, maybe Adnan hesitates: dude, what if I need to go somewhere & you're out buying and selling pot in my car? So Jay says hey why don't you get a cellphone? Then if something comes up, you can call me & I'll bring your wheels back! Of course I'm just making this up - but my brain won't stop trying to make some sense out of the tiny bits of information I do have..."	20141126T151307

yojrbraps	12	0	Totally agree. This also makes me think that Adnan definitely did *not* pay Jay to help. I would think that if that were true, he would have latched on to that with the police and there would have been more evidence to back Jay up. It also just doesn't make sense because here he is, ratting Adnan out, so he must already have some assurance from the detectives that they are going to take care of him at this point.	20141126T143237
Longclock	10	0	What bothers me in Jay's argument above is how he weighs the two crimes (murder & selling weed) against one another. He is describing a hypothetical tit-for-tat where the punishments for each do not equate (not to mention the moral imperative to intervene). The cops are parroting what Jen stated during her recorded interview. In Jen's interview she suggests that Jay would only help with egregious act of helping murder/cover up a murder if there was a monetary incentive. Basically, yes, it can be interpreted as a negotiation of sorts but the association with drugs versus with an act of murder remains a weak reason not to have stepped forward to prevent it.	20141126T151503
damselmadness	10	0	"So much of Jay's interviews sound like they're suggestions of what happened, rather than actual testimony. I completely agree with you on this. It absolutely feels as though they're sort of ""talking around"" the recorder, almost like a code."	20141126T145316
Frosted_Mini-Wheats	5	0	In some iteration of what Jay knew when, he says Adnan's been talking about killing Hae for days before he told Jay ok, today's the day, take my car & phone, I'll call you when it's done. Doesn't that make Jay an accessory before the fact? A co-conspirator?	20141126T152126
xjasonlx	3	0	"I've never bought Jay's motive for helping Adnan. Whether it's money or fear of ratting him out as drug dealer or both. I don't see a guy like Jay helping bury a body. Way too risky. A guy like Jay says ""sorry man you're on your own"". He calls Adnan's bluff and waits to see if Adnan has the balls to turn him in for dealing. Then he rolls on Adnan. Not before. Why would Adnan risk angering the ONE GUY who can turn him in? Jay killed Hae and turns on the only guy he can frame. That is the only explanation for why he talks to the cops."	20141127T000030
anonymous	2	0	"These recorded interviewS (important to remember they did two separate taped statements) came after weeks of police questioning. You have to take all of it with a giant grain of salt in both directions- truth and falsehood. At this point, for all we know, off-tape the police told Jay ""look, people are going to question why you didn't just come forward with this (etc)....you're going to need a reason why you didn't. Maybe Adnan threatened to call the cops on you for (selling dope) (sleeping with someone underage) (having a handgun) (banging a prostitute) (insert whatever behavior Jay may have engaged in and told the cops about that never came to light here)"" So the awkwardness of the tape could be because he is doing a crap job of saying what he was coached to say.

ithacavids	3	0	however, when you are dealing illegal drugs there are more people involved than just you - like... Jay's dealer, other drug dealers who are selling more than weed- when police make an arrest of someone like Jay for selling weed, they don't stop there - they try to go to the ultimate source - so Jay had plenty to protect, including his own safety.	20141126T164024
anonymous	2	0	he could have been charged several different ways for numerous crimes related to this. but he wasn't. for whatever reason, the investigation turned toward Adnan at some point and the police and state believed they needed Jay to make their case. Once that became true, every interaction with Jay was about making him the perfect witness, which meant cutting him a deal.	20141126T203813
elizabethraine	4	0	"That's what I thought. I mean, his excuse for not warning Hae or anyone else, if I remember, was something along the lines of ""I didn't believe it"". That sounds weak to me.

Longclock	2	0	That is great point & one I hadn't given as much consideration as is perhaps warranted. Jay was being questioned by homicide detectives though. Wouldn't another department handle drugs (narcotics)? The mere confession of dealing pot doesn't constitute grounds for charging someone or even enlisting their help in naming other people. Cops have to find it in your possession or observe you trying to sell it. So to refer back to OP's likening the exchange to a negotiation, perhaps it was some sort of attempt between cops & Jay to formulate a narrative & garner protection from potential prosecution. One thing I'm hung up on is there doesn't seem to be the expected inquiry into Jay's own alibi....	20141126T173836

fakerjohn	3	0	"If they were going to get dimes, I really doubt that Jay was a dealer. I think he was more of the guy who was willing to drive up (someone else's car) to the corner and make purchases. We all knew a guy like that in high school. He's poor so he plays very small time middle man to get in on the smoke session. Now we also new guys who were strong dealers at a young age. Those guys didn't live with their parents and have jobs. They didn't need them. They dropped out of school, got a house and didn't go driving around all the time. The ""criminal element"" thing is bullshit. His story telling is so obviously a ""look at me"" mentality. I knew a guy in high school who killed a guy over a drug deal and went to prison for it. It was about $100 worth of weed. It did not need to happen. It was all about the drama. Jay is totally that guy. If Adnan killed Hae it was because Jay amped him up with bullshit. But I think Jay did it for little to no reason and tried to spin it up into something else later. Sorry for the long OT speculation but I just listened to everything all over again for the maybe eighth time and am so freaking sick of listening to Jay and Adnan spinning such obvious and typical high school jerk bullshit."	20141127T003858
anonymous	2	0	I see your point. There are two (other besides the fact that being an accessory to murder is way worse than dealing drugs) main reasons that I really just don't believe that Jay was afraid of Adnan going to the police about his drug dealing. 1.) Adnan would implicate himself as well as Jay. It would eventually somehow get out that Adnan was one of Jay's clients since he smoked pot with im quiet frequently. 2.) Adnan would be going to the cops which wouldn't be a wise decision if he just committed a murder. Also this would give Jay an opportunity to rat Adnan out to the police anyways.	20141126T182301

It's unlike Serial in two very distinct ways: 1) Unlike Sarah Koenig, Errol Morris was absolutely absent as a *character* from the story itself. This was formally groundbreaking for documentaries, because there wasn't ""a narrator telling a story"". In fact, the footage in the film that comes from interviews of the real people who were there doesn't include ANY of the interviewer's voice. The real people involved with the incident 100% speak for themselves. (Far too much so, in one case.) 2) Unlike Serial is at all likely to do, TBL took a clear stance about the innocence and guilt of its subjects, and ultimately the information that Morris uncovered was instrumental in getting an innocent man released from prison."	20141126T190907

MusicCompany	2	0	"It was a bad decision, but I do think it is likely what Adnan decided to do. I doubt he knew that his phone could be tracked in such detail. He may well have figured that a cell phone would be a much better means of communication because, unlike a land line or pay phone, it couldn't be tracked to an exact geographical location (which, in fact, he was correct about--hence all the debates about the pings and what they mean). Picture this scenario. Adnan is furious over Hae dumping him for the final time and really falling for someone else. His ego is bruised, and he decides to get even. Jay is his accessory and his alibi. Like anyone with nefarious motives, he leads with a gift. Stores use this method all the time. It's nearly Black Friday--how many stores will give you a free gift if you show up at their store? Why do they do this? Because they know that receiving a gift gets you into the store, and it puts you in a generous mood because you got something for ""free."" So, Adnan loans Jay the phone and the car. He helps Jay pick out a gift for Stephanie. Jay must have thought he hit the jackpot on January 13. He gets to use a cell phone and car most of the day. All he has to do in return is a couple of small favors: pick Adnan up here and there. Oh yeah, except that by meeting Adnan and being shown a dead body in a car trunk, he's now associated with a murder. And he can't go to the cops because he wouldn't even go to the cops if he was being shot at."	20141126T161727

Plus, they have an estimated number of episodes, so give or take a few weeks they might take off (like they're doing for Thanksgiving), they know generally when this thing ends. I do feel incredibly lied to by the team putting this story together. On the other hand, *if* they know a few key target things are waiting for resolution (e.g., the PERK re-evaluation) and expect that to happen shortly, they can drag out what they have until this bit of information comes back, and they can resolve on that, whatever it is. I strongly suspect this is the true state of things. They have to know with some certainty that they're close to getting an actual answer that will give new information of some kind.	20141126T193649

nomickti	4	0	"This is some of the ""Real Life"" timeline as I've been able to piece it together: So now we know that SK spoke to Jay before the podcast was first broadcast. ""Like if this works, every question we've had for the past eight months, he knows it"" was at the end of episode 1 on October 3rd. From the first episode, Sarah said ""For the last year, I've spent every working day trying to figure out where a high school kid was for an hour after school one day in 1999"". So we can assume Rabia approached her in September-October 2013. That would put the Jay interview at May-June 2014. Considering the Innocence Project put out their press release October 3rd about working on Adnan's case (http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2014_fall/innocenceproject.htm), and that was after their 4 week review (Ep 7: ""Four weeks later, I checked back in with Deirdra and two of her students""), let's say they decided to take the case the last week of September 2014. She likely approached Deirdra about Justin Wolfe's case around early August 2014 (ep 7: ""I called her and asked how she dealt with the cell records in the Justin Wolfe .... then the next time we talked, I asked if she’d mind going to a studio.""). So after telling her about her conversations with Jay in May-June, Deirdra and the IP still thought it was worth following up."	20141126T192608

They have terms for being 'emergency horny,' (think: 2 AM sexy) and that feeling of embarrassment one gets on behalf of another person making a fool of him/herself (think: people of Walmart.)

Just simply based on Jay's story and messy timeline alone?"	20141126T164041
readybrek	1	0	It's a good timeline but do you have an explanation of how Jay met Hae? She's in a tearing hurry, we have two witnesses that say this, Debbie Warren and Inez Butler Hendricks both independently say they see her about 3pm and she is obviously in a rush. We know why she is in a rush, she's probably pushing it a bit for picking up her cousin at 3.15pm so how is someone going to persuade her to stop and talk to them? Jay has opportunity as in an amount of time he could plausible have murdered Hae as he has no alibi but what about opportunity in intercepting Hae somewhere, that's got to be more likely Adnan. PS I hope you don't mind me critically analysing your theory, I'm in the same boat - why would Hae ever stop and talk to Jay when she's in a rush, so it's nothing personal :-)	20141203T124232
serialmonotony	3	0	Because the state have to fit into the narrative an incoming call from Adnan to Jay after the murder takes place saying 'Come get me'. The reason they need this is so that Jay can testify he wasn't present at the murder itself but was summoned afterwards. The 2.36 call is the only one that can fit this account of events, since the 3.15 incoming call doesn't allow enough time for the rest of the movements in their narrative to take place when they say they did.	20141126T165922

But I don't know if schools in 1999 in general or Hae's cousin's school in particular had a similar procedure (line up in pick-up lane, wait for someone to send your kid to your car, etc). It does seem like someone (an investigator of some sort) could have figured this out 15 years ago though.	20141126T171341

My best friend in high school got a cell phone our senior year, 1999-2000, and she couldn't have cared less about it. She kept it in her car all the time. I understand that a lot of people were stoked about having one but everyone considered it the holy grail. We know that Jay and Adnan were more than just acquaintances. It was said that Jay used to use Adnan's car all the time and it wasn't unusual for him to pick him up from practice. I am willing to bet that Adnan got free pot out of the deal, or at least a really good price. I don't think it was Adnan that had his hopes pinned on the states timeline being crap, I think that was the fault of his legal team. You can't really say what his parents are more disturbed about, unless you know them personally.	20141126T173945

Also, he knows pretty well that ""i don't remember"" doesn't help him, so you could also see it not as his biggest defense, but helplessness. >--Who the heck gives their cellphone to a casual acquaintance/non-friend in 1999!

DUDE. did you see the photo of his car? complete junk. if i had that car i'd have to PAY someone to take it for a ride. Also, if lending a cellphone is such a nonsense for you, doesn't mean it's like that for everyone else. I gave all my shit to everybody all the time. I think i bought something like 50-60 usb drives in my lifetime, gave them all to my friends and never saw them again. who cares. >--All because there wasn't a payphone in Best Buy doesn't mean much - because after all, it wasn't Jay who witnessed where the call was placed from - he got the detail from Adnan. He could have been anywhere on the way or somewhere completely different. We don't know why Jay placed him there, it could be because of potential knowledge/involvement of Stephanie as well. Means a lot. If you care, here's an analysis The Prosecution’s “Come-and-Get-Me” Call The Prosecution’s Story: After Woodlawn let out at 2:15 p.m., Adnan caught a ride in Hae’s car, and then strangled her to death in the Best Parking Lot (“BBPL”). The prosecution then says that at 2:36 p.m., Adnan used a pay phone outside of Best Buy to call his cell phone (which Jay had), and Adnan told Jay to pick him up. Note: For various reasons, the prosecution’s theory of the 2:36 call is not likely to be correct. It is not based on the testimony of any witness, and cannot be squared by known timelines, but it is the only call the prosecution can identify that might have come from Adnan. Adnan’s Story: After school let out, he probably would have gone to the library and checked his e-mail, while waiting for track practice to start, which either begins at 3:30 (Episode 1), (Appellant’s Brief at 5); or at 4:00 p.m. (Episode 5). Jay’s Stories (**Four** Versions): In Jay’s first interview, on 2/28/99, Jay tells the police that he was at Jenn’s house from a little after noon until “Adnan called him about 3:45 p.m. saying ‘come pick me up.’” Jay explains that he went to pick Adnan up at a location 20 minutes away (marked above with an asterisk), “from off of Edmondson Avenue at a strip,” and that when Jay got there, Adnan “popped the trunk open,” revealing Hae’s body (Jay’s 2/28/99 Interview). In Jay’s second interview, on 3/15/99, he says that when Adnan called Jay, he told him that “that bitch is dead. Come and get me. I’m at Best Buy.” In the same interview, Jay explains why he lied about where he saw the body the first time: Detective MacGillivary: “Why did you lie about the location?” Jay: “Uh, I figured there was cameras there or somebody had spotted him doing what he was doing.” (Id.) In Jay’s third interview, on 4/13/1999, Jay “told police that [Adnan] killed Hae in Patapsco State Park, and that [Adnan] paid him to help” (Brief of Appellant at 11). Jay’s fourth story, which he tells his friend Chris, is that he was at a pool hall in Catonsville when Adnan called. Adnan then drove to the pool hall in Hae’s car, and that is where the “trunk pop” occurs. What the Cell Phone Records Show: The cell phone records show that, at 2:36 p.m., Jay was in vicinity of Hae’s last-known location. Because the phone records also show that Jay was not at Jenn’s house that afternoon (as he and Jenn claim), that leaves us with the following: (1) Jay was near Hae when she went missing, and (2) Jay has no alibi for where he was at the time. Note: Jay’s explanation for why he lied about where the trunk pop occurred is completely nonsensical — if you assume that Jay isn’t lying about everything else. Jay’s answer only makes sense if, in fact, that is the only question that Jay has actually answered truthfully. He’s telling the truth about why he lied. Because the reason Jay lied about where Hae was murdered is that he was worried there might have been cameras at that location. And if the police checked those cameras, they would see that it had been Jay, not Adnan, who was in the parking lot with Hae. Hence, in Jay’s first statement, he gave the police a made up location, far away from Best Buy. But by the time of Jay’s second interview, he had learned that Jenn had told the police about where Hae had been killed, and that there were in fact no cameras at that location. >--Adnan was shown to have hung out with Jay at multiple times throughout the day. OK? So if Jay did it, he would have had to do it around all these interactions while carrying Adnan's phone with him. Come on! His phone was in the park man. Yea, but there's a huge gap between those times they were together. His phone was indeed in the park, sure, but why would he be paging Jenn if HE was there? He was supposedly digging. >--Adnan seemed to have his hopes pinned up on the fact that the sequence described by the State does not work. It doesn't matter. All because they got the sequence wrong (which he knows if he is guilty) doesn't mean he is innocent. Of course it matters. If the timeline and sequence doesn't work, he MIGHT be innocent. it works both ways. >--What Adnan says about his Parents being more disturbed because of ""injustice"" is simply wrong. Anyone would tell you that Parents would be way more disturbed if their son actually did it. He would never want to own up to it for their sake. Depends. Depends on parents. There are people who prefer the truth, people who prefer to live in a lie, people who don't even want to know anything. Depends. That said, i still believe we don't know everything.

anonymous	1	0	Meanwhile the entire case is built off the word of a degenerate, petty drug dealing 18 year old with pre/post convictions of violence, drugs and more with a family history of the same. Along with the fact that his interviewers change many times and no substantial hard evidence (being DNA) linking him to a crime. The D.A. played to the emotions of the jurors and was successful. Adnans own lawyer was flawed and misrepresented him and so did his second attorney. I'm not saying he is 100% innocent, but according to the current FACTS provided he is not guilty at the moment. If jurors where robots who took in facts and produced an outcome rather than being humans who feed into emotions it would be a different case.	20141127T013210
serialisgreat	1	0	> --Adnan and Jenn were close. Jenn implicated Adnan ultimately. This is incorrect. Jenn is a friend of Jay's, not Adnan's. One of the key pieces of evidence in figuring out the day's events is that there were seven calls placed to Jenn from Adnan's phone, but Adnan was not friends with Jenn. > --All because there wasn't a payphone in Best Buy doesn't mean much - because after all, it wasn't Jay who witnessed where the call was placed from - he got the detail from Adnan. I really encourage you to review the evidence in this case more carefully. Jay testified at trial (under oath, of course) that when he came to pick up Adnan immediately after Adnan had killed Hae, Adnan was standing by a payphone outside of Best Buy and wearing red gloves. (See Adnan's appeal brief, page 8) The fact that there is no evidence of such a payphone ever existing is important because Adnan was convicted on the basis of this testimony. Other people have already responded to the other points.	20141127T080036

brickbacon	4	0	> Oh, just read on rabia blog that adnans been seen in his track suit around 3pm and he went to take his recommendation letter, there's a photo of that letter and theres 1.13.1999 on it. I think that [letter](http://www.splitthemoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Recommendation-later-dated-Jan-13-.png) is complete bullshit. 1. Why is the date written in pen on the bottom? 2. Who dates a letter on the bottom of the page? 3. Recommendation letters are usually sent by the teacher or the school counseling office, not the student. There would be no reason for him to send it off himself. Not only because they don't want students doctoring them, but also because schools don't want them sent with applications. See [here](http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/000344/) >While some teachers do give copies of their letters to students, it is advisable to sign the waiver on the application that allows teachers to write confidentially. Colleges do NOT want to see that letters of reference have arrived with YOUR materials. They should be submitted separately, either directly by the teachers or from your guidance office. Teachers almost NEVER give the letter to the student. My mom was a high school teacher for 20+ years, and I remember having to drop of dozens of recommendations in the mail for her students. More importantly, why is this letter only coming up now and why doesn't Adnan remember stopping by to retrieve it?	20141126T191605
anonymous	2	0	You said he was near the school, that's not the call log that's the cell tower information. Adnan was seen near the gym around 3 in his track suit and Hea was seen in the gym lobby around 3pm. So there is that. Jay has maintained that the come get me call was 3:45ish so by that account Adnan had plenty of time. Was the track suit tested against the red and blue fibers? We don't know however I bet if it was its in the evidence catalog. SK may have a few more bombshells coming I hope so.	20141126T183151

prettikitti89	1	0	Wow. I just looked at the letter. A handwritten date at the bottom after the signature? That's just shady.	20141126T233742
serialisgreat	1	0	The reason that the letter is just coming up now is that the timeline has changed now that the prosecution's alleged timing has been debunked. The big focal point until now was 2:36 PM, because that was when the prosecution claimed Adnan called Jay to come pick him up at Best Buy. Now that SK has done research indicating that the Best Buy payphone never existed and that Summer was talking to Hae in front of the high school gym until 2:45 PM, the window for Hae's disappearance has narrowed to some time between 2:45 and 3 PM or so. I agree that adding the date at the end of the letter looks weird. However, if the letter is fake or the date was added later, it seems like that detail would be pretty easy to expose simply by asking the teacher. I can't say for certain, but I believe one or two of my high school teachers provided me with letters of recommendation in sealed envelopes that I then sent to colleges. I vaguely recall being tempted to open the envelopes and read the letters. I could be misremembering, though, and I agree that it would be very unusual for a teacher to give an unsealed letter to a student.	20141127T081428
dev1anter	1	0	But per prosecution she was killed BEFORE 2.36! See, nothing adds up! Good catch about them possibly being together near the jym! I know I said that he was near school. I based that on tower info (sorry, I said call logs, brain fart) If we want to believe tower info (like the prosecution did) then we can work with that. If you read rhe link there's a nice explanation about every call, statementsX cell info etc (unlike prosecutions's cherry picked analysis of tower cell info). Anyways, the point is that Jay doesn't have an alibi and could have been *anywhere*. At least we agree that's theres more to it ;)	20141126T184109
Irkeley	1	0	The 2.36 and the 3.15 call places him near the location where she was last seen. 2.36 just south if the school, and 3.15 just west if the school. That leaves about 45 minutes of time between the two pings, just the time she disappears.	20141126T214313
anonymous	1	0	I think we agree on quite a bit. You seem quite reasonable. I think we can count on the cell towers, so I actually think Jay was in the area. I think he was waiting for Adnan to call him to say he killed Hae though. I think they were both heavily involved.	20141126T184853

HomeBrewThis	7	0	I wondered how easy it would be for Jay to have butt dialed Nisha as that is a fairly damning call in my opinion. So I looked up the Nokia Manual for Adnan's phone and linked to the One Touch Dialing Page. For that call, in my mind, there are a couple of options: 1. Adnan (and Jay) were with the phone and called Nisha 2. Jay called Nisha as a setup (unlikely I think since Jay doesn't seem to think through much) 3. Jay butt dialed Nisha EDIT: FOrmatting	20141126T174448

EvilSockMonkey	3	0	If cell phones had been common when I was 17 and **any** of my friends had had a girlfriend's number stored in it, **none** of them would have let me anywhere near that phone, let alone have possession of it unsupervised! Nisha testified that the line on which she received the call did not have voicemail or an answering machine. If it lacked caller ID as well, Jay could have easily called her and as long as he didn't identify himself, it would have been just another crank call to her and there would be no reason to remember it. Some one listening to a butt dial or some one engaging with an unknown caller are both possible explanations for the call that don't require Adnan to have been present.	20141126T194035
MisoSoup	3	0	Can someone clear up if calls are (were in 1999) timed from sending or from pick-up? This has not been definitivley answered.

bunnybearlover	15	0	I had that phone and so did my mother. It was so easy to butt dial. My mom used to call and leave these super long messages of nothing but background noise. When I did it she would sit and listen to see if I was doing anything wrong. That was one of my suspicions about the call. Maybe someone answered and did sit and listen to some random conversation going on on the other end. Either that or I'm quite sure I remember back then they would charge even when the phone was just ringing. That would explain why there were quite a few super short calls on the list too.	20141126T191900
LadyDustBunny	3	0	I think the third option is a very likely thing to have happened. It would make sense that Nisha was set in Adnan's phone in that way because she was the first person he called after he first got his cell phone.	20141126T191630
anonymous	3	0	SK already went over the fact that Nisha can't remember a conversation wherein she spoke to both Jay and Adnan that doesn't take place at the video store. Nisha mentioned it in the first trial but again in the 2nd before getting interrupted by the prosecution. if she can't remember an instance that didn't occur outside the video store, then she couldn't have spoken to adnan according to jay's alibi. in my opinion its pretty clear that it was either: 1) a butt dial and a system generated voicemail system took the message, or 2) somebody picked up and tried to talk to neither adnan nor jay.	20141126T222949
bunnybearlover	10	0	There were a few more calls to Nisha that evening on the call log. I think she was mistaken about talking to Jay on that day though because she references a job that he only had weeks after.	20141126T192521
HomeBrewThis	9	0	My theory is that IF it was a butt dial then it rang and rang for about two minutes. Eventually the call either hung up itself or Jay hung it up when he noticed it ringing. That explains the two minute charge without a message. Nisha did not have voicemail on her cell. Then you have Nisha saying she DID talk to Jay once when Adnan handed him the phone (they have no other connection). However, this call happened as Adnan was walking into the video store where Jay worked. Jay didn't work at the video store until February. This means that she and Jay are talking about a phonecall that didn't happen until later, but is being attributed to the butt dial on the day of the murder. Jay would be bending the narrative to fit the call log, which seems to be what he has been doing within each new interview and as he gets coached by the police. EDIT: Clarification.	20141126T192527
EvilSockMonkey	3	0	Nisha did not claim to have spoken to Adnan. Nisha remembered an occasion when she spoke with Adnan and Jay together. The prosecution alleged that that was the call. Further investigation seems to have discredited the prosecution's theory/allegation.	20141126T192639
HomeBrewThis	3	0	On your point against giving friend's a phone with a GF's number stored in it, I graduated in 1997 and they were becoming more common. We would, in fact, borrow each other's phones and prank each other's friends. Email was relatively new as well, same deal. For you other points about the call not needing Adnan to be present, I agree and don't think there is evidence he was present from Nisha, only Jay's testimony who had access to all the call logs.	20141126T194553

temp4adhd	1	0	Really? My 86 year old FIL (before he passed this year) butt dialed us regularly about once a week, as we were his #1 contact. The calls would go on and on and on. Mostly we'd just hear background noise since he was in the car driving. Once (just last year) we heard him flirting with some mysterious woman who was in the car with him. Butt dials happen more regularly, I think, if you tuck your phone in your back pocket while driving. i don't believe I've ever butt dialed anyone, but my phone usually gets tucked in my purse, not my back pocket.	20141127T025010

HomeBrewThis	1	0	"I don't agree with it, but the ""Nisha Call"" in episode 8 was cited as the most damning evidence against Adnan. Nisha doesn't pick up on the day of the murder and says there is no voicemail, but the phone logs 2 minutes. There could have been a ""this user has not set up their inbox"" message or it could have just rang and was billed. I think it is likely a butt dial, but I wanted more evidence to support that than just assuming it was since Adnan alleges Nisha was on speed dial. So, if Adnan says Nisha was on speed dial but you have to press two buttons in sequence (Call+2) or something more complicated to call then it would be less likely Jay made that call. However, it appears all you had to do was press and hold ""2"" for a few seconds. So we agree."	20141126T223626
robintherobot	6	0	I got the impression that it wasn't her cell phone, but a land line with no answering machine (I think that was the term she used) or voicemail. I could be wrong, though. Not that it matters a whole lot.	20141126T205525
EvilSockMonkey	1	0	Without the trial transcript, it is hard to be sure, but it appears that the *not answered* issue was addressed there. From Episode 6: <begin quote> **Adnan Syed** To me, the explanation to that is that-- for whatever reason he pushed the number, maybe he didn’t know it was on, and it picks up, because when the answering machine picks up a call, it bills it. **Sarah Koenig** But if she-- she says she testifies that her phone does not have an answering machine or voicemail on it. So who is picking up that call and talking for two and a half minutes or whatever it was? Two minutes and twenty-two seconds or some-- **Adnan Syed** You sure she testified to that? **Sarah Koenig** I’m sure. <end quote> There really wouldn't have been any reason to cover the answering machine question at trial unless they were attempting to prove that someone must have pick-up. That does not eliminate the BD theory, it simply makes it required that someone picked it up and listened to background for a while.	20141126T210024

anonymous	1	0	How is speaking to Adnan and Jay together not speaking to Adnan? I was just curious as to whether the theory was that her testimony in which she spoke to Adnan and Jay on Adnan's cell (better?) was that she was mistaken about the timing or content of that call, or what. Because I've always brushed the entire Nisha call aside as not a smoking gun, since she referenced this video store job that Jay didn't yet have. (And does that mean at some point post-Jan 13, Adnan and Jay were hanging out calling Nisha together from the video store?)	20141126T193331

So, the complete theory is that once Jay was presented with the call logs he worked with the police to make the narrative fit the logs. This is the ""corroborating evidence"". What I think could have happened is that it was a butt dial and Jay massaged it in to the case against Adnan."	20141126T193930
EvilSockMonkey	4	0	My mistake. I should have written: Nisha did not claim to have spoken to Adnan on January 13th. She did claim to have spoken with Jay and Adnan together once, but she did not cite a specific date and time. It was the prosecution that claimed that aforementioned call occurred on January 13th. In Nisha's testimony she states: Nisha Ummm, it’s a little hard to recall, but I remember him telling me that Jay invite- invited him over to a video store that he worked at. And, he basically well Adnan walked in with his cell phone and then like- he told me to speak with Jay and I was like ‘okay’ cause Jay wanted to say hi so I said hi to Jay. And that’s all I can really recall. Many discount that this call did or could have occurred on January 13th, because Jay had not yet begun to work at the video store.	20141126T194846
anonymous	1	0	Adnan says to Jay? Yes, I forgot, I thought it was the other way around, because of the prosecution's car version. Also this is based on Nisha's recall some weeks later, or her version of events, which should be taken into account.	20141127T200644
whitenoise2323	1	0	sure, why not? any specific calls that are verified by all parties that wouldn't make sense?	20141126T215616
bunnybearlover	1	0	That especially makes sense for that. I don't normally make calls that last 18-20 seconds. There were quite a few of those.	20141126T221427
HomeBrewThis	1	0	Yes, I saw this and think if the third scenario is true then this is what happened. I was exploring how the phone actually worked. I figure if to butt dial all that needed to happen was one button press then scenario three is far more likely. If the caller needed to hold call+number or some similar process then I lean toward Adnan or Jay calling intentionally.	20141126T193103
brickbacon	1	0	Yes, but why do you believe this?	20141126T220626
anonymous	2	0	You're right, it would be great if SK could confirm this detail.	20141126T223747
anonymous	2	0	I assumed that the very short calls were *intentional* ones where the caller hung up after nobody picked up right away. If the Nisha call was a butt-dial, it could go on for the full two minutes without anybody stopping it.	20141127T092350
whitenoise2323	1	0	Because it's a possible explanation that would create reasonable doubt as to whether Adnan was with Jay during the critical period that Hae was likely abducted and/or killed.	20141126T221505
HomeBrewThis	1	0	I suppose because its believable that he would have Nisha on speed dial since he was dating her. Also, if scenario one is true and Jay and Adnan were together as Jay alleges then Nisha would corroborate that call. Two minutes with no talking appears to be a butt dial, and that jives with Adnan AND Nisha's account of calls that day, not Jay's.	20141126T222429
brickbacon	1	0	So you believe Adnan's account because it would create reasonable doubt for Adnan?	20141127T011434
brickbacon	1	0	Nisha does corroborate the call. She testified to the time and date of the call. You can argue she was wrong about the details of the call, but you cannot say she didn't believe she spoke to both of them that day at that time. Additionally, there are numerous explanations for the discrepancy beside just assuming she is wrong on all accounts: 1. She is misremembering the details of the call 2. Jay did work there or was hired by that time. Although I trust SK, the evidence Jay was not working there seems to come from Adnan's PI asking the store manager at the time. 3. She misheard and they Jay was going to work there. The idea that there was no talking on a two minute call, or that it was a butt dial is pure fiction invented to provide exculpatory evidence for Adnan. It's certainly not a LIKELY scenario, and it one we can ONLY entertain if Adnan isn't lying about the speed dial. Why should anyone trust that without corroboration?	20141127T012250
anonymous	3	0	isn't he being sardonic?	20141127T013308
HomeBrewThis	3	0	No, I am undecided about Adnan. I believe the account because Jay is a liar, Nisha has no reason to lie, and it makes no difference one way or another if Nisha was on speed dial. However, given the evidence I believe it is most likely she was butt dialed rather than called intentionally. Whether by Adnan or Jay I don't know, but I lean towards Adnan's innocence. I would submit that the same argument can be made about the state's case and Jay's entire testimony. Why is it true because Jay says it is? The only things that Jay has said that have been independently corroborated are the location of the body, how Hae was murdered, and the car. Nothing else has been even remotely consistent. So why believe something just to provide reasonable doubt for Jay?	20141127T033915
HomeBrewThis	2	0	"Can you point me to where Nisha corroborates the time and date? I don't see that in the podcast or the appellate briefs. If I'm wrong I'll rethink it. What I see Nisha corroborating is that she spoke to Jay and Adnan together once. That one time was at the video store when Adnan handed the phone to Jay. Jay, a proven liar (testimony, interviews, witness accounts) was given call logs and allowed to develop a narrative with the police. One of those calls was the damning ""Nisha Call"". Jay says he talked to Nisha the day of the murder at that time. Nisha does not recall it that way. Adnan has no idea (as usual) but mentions he has Nisha on speed dial. So the available evidence suggests it was either a mistaken dial or intentional. Since I don't think Jay (personal opinion) has the brains to think ahead I tend toward a butt dial. Although it could certainly be Adnan calling Nisha before a burial and after a murder, I think thats a less likely scenario."	20141127T015546
anonymous	1	0	You say it is not likely. But others say it is the *most* likely. That is, it is *most* likely that a 2-minute call to someone would be a butt dial. Let's ask ourselves this question: of all the 2-minute calls that are made, or were made around 1999, admittedly to people on speed dial, how many will be butt dials? Would it be 0.001%? Would it be 0.01%? Or, let's really stretch things out here ... would it be 0.1%? Now Adnan believes that it is *likely*, so say above 50%. OK, that's understandable. And yes, it *could* have happened that way. But does anyone else really think this is likely?	20141127T014015
HomeBrewThis	1	0	Yeah, I think so :)	20141127T021806

anonymous	4	0	Hey I know about the city. Lived there in a few different areas over many years. I disagree with anyone painting Woodlawn as some wholesome suburb. There was a carjacking, make that some guy carjacked/attempted to carjack 4 cars in a row one afternoon on Liberty Rd. in March of 1999 just south of the high school. Woodlawn hugs the city. It was a city murder, investigation, and conviction. There's some real life posted for you in the link above.	20141127T022506
lizard6	6	0	Yes, thank you. I went to high school in Baltimore County (a senior in 99 actually, but not at Woodlawn). Baltimore County and Baltimore City are not the same. Woodlawn is not the best area in Baltimore County, but it's certainly not the inner city. These are county kids. Yes, the case was handled in the city, but these are suburban high school kids. The Wire is fiction.	20141127T020110

2242whatitdo	2	0	Yes, the whole witness thing was just speculation, but I think there would have been a lot more pressure on the police to solve this murder given the victim lived in the county, rather than another murder that was less of a deal in the city (like a 17 year old shot on the street). And I also spent a considerable amount of time in Baltimore and dated a girl who is from there (Towson, Owings Mills) for 4 years so while I don't know the city like a lifelong resident, I have experience with it. There are just so many problems with the Baltimore criminal justice system and the police department I think that it would be wrong to ignore it. The same as they made the case in the Serial Podcast, you have to look at all angles whether you like it or not, and I think it could have played a role in Adnan's conviction. Like if this had happened in another city would the investigation or trial been conducted in a better manner? I like to think that it would have been handled way better in another city. Not submitting certain evidence to forensics, etc. could also have been a function of the slim resources they are supposed to work magic with.	20141127T181729

nautilus2000	1	0	Woodlawn isn't the wealthiest of suburbs and has problems but it has far more in common with your typical American suburb than it does with the sections of Baltimore city that appeared on the Wire.

Not to be argumentative, but I wonder how much experience you really have with Baltimore if you think The Wire and the mentality it portrayed is 100% representative of the city and Woodlawn. I would have to guess that the girl you dated who was from Baltimore doesn't exactly fit neatly into the Wire's cast of characters.

If she is truly interested in the bigger picture my hope is she brings all of this to light somehow. It's really sad the residents of the city pay for all of the man hours, evidence testing, appellate court fees, and civil suits when the State overreaches and gently tiptoes across ethical lines to win wrongful convictions. I'm not even counting the money Maryland residents pony up to house inmates. It's all sucked down the drain when it should be reinvested in the city and state. It's an endless cycle. Meaningful change will not occur until the residents of Baltimore speak up and take a stand.	20141128T055854

Current character and acquaintances opinions about character have no grounding in the truth of the murder at all. They can't even prove motive, and that the prosecution used is it as motive is outstanding on their part. Of course, the small clip of Gutierrez cross examining Jay shows that she bungled that piece of the case because she was combative while Jay was polite and respectful. What a horrible way of destroying his credibility... it built sympathy.	20141126T185803

Happiness studies have shown, for example, that levels of happiness will change right after winning the lottery, or becoming paraplegic. But approximately a year after the ""event"",....happiness levels will be roughly where they were pre-event. There is no evidence to suggest that anything (short of traumatic brain injury) changes your personality or character permanently. Everything suggests the opposite. We are who we are. The murder/imprisonment of Adnan would not have changed his personality or character in my opinion."	20141126T204554
anonymous	0	0	But we've heard from a lot of people that described Adnan like this anyway. Kind, smart, handsome, a good athlete and very caring. That was also made clear by the letters he sent to Krista during this whole process of being convicted.	20141126T183721
character_witness	12	0	And that's the crux of Serial, isn't it? What the heck ARE the facts? What exactly do they prove? It's very hard to make any sense of the things that happened that day, so we're left playing this game of who's more likely to be a criminal.	20141126T190305
The_Effing_Eagle	4	0	I agree to an extent, but when the people around him characterize him in a certain way, as a nice, charming guy, for that entire 15+ year period, it does make it very difficult to buy him doing something so horrible.

anonymous	22	0	I posted my thoughts about that in another thread, but that seems kinda dead. I'll repost it here. I think that evidence of Adnan's duplicitous behavior towards Ms. Koenig is very apparent if you know where to look. In my experience, criminals tend to exhibit behavior that they think appears normal to people, assuming that you don't second-guess it. And sometimes it does. They put on this incredulous, confused attitude hoping that they can instill a seed of doubt into your mind, while feigning utter befuddlement at why they're in the situation that they're in. Example - claiming that you aren't angry at someone who basically framed you for murder and put you in prison for life, and is, therefore, the likely murderer or accomplice of the murderer of someone who was very dear to you. That's just insane on the face of it. How many times I've heard the same ridiculous story from defendants on the witness stand / in a videotaped statement. I'm not upset at him, we're good friends - I don't know why he's saying I shot him. I still love my ex-wife - I don't know why she's saying that I broke into her home and raped her. I never drink - I don't understand why the officer said that he smelled alcohol on my breath. I don't own a gun - I have no idea how one was found in my house. I didn't hit the pedestrian there, I don't even drive there; the accident was miles away, the police must be mistaken. Basically, if they act incredulous, confused and downright befuddled as to why they're being accused, I don't find that exculpatory (contrary to what the Innocence Project people have opined.) The vast majority of the time, it's simply a mask that they're putting on in order to put one over on an audience.	20141126T181748

orangegirl	1	0	I have thought about Adnan's attitude to Jay, and the best I can come up with is that *if* he is innocent he has spent the last 15 years processing his wrongful conviction. He has had a lot of time to think about what happens when people are over confident about things they don't know, or their own theories. I wonder if an innocent man would be extremely reluctant to put another person in the position he finds himself in: convicted of a crime on assumption, circumstances and bias rather than evidence. I also wonder if not thinking to much about these things is something of a coping mechanism for Adnan. He has narratives that he will engage on, but anything outside those particular stories is locked away. That kind of anger would eat away at your soul. I do not accept that the prosecution case was proved beyond reasonable doubt. I cannot understand how the jury convicted on the evidence we have heard so far. Either SK has saved a crucial piece of evidence to reveal later, or this conviction was unfounded. It seems undeniable that Adnan's experience of the judicial system would colour his world view, and particularly his view of law enforcement and prosecution. Note I am not commenting on whether or not Adnan is responsible for Hae's death. Just about the process. Edit: a word	20141127T003138
MusicCompany	1	0	Maybe Jay was able to be polite and respectful in response to the line of questioning because Gutierrez' client told her a phony story that didn't push Jay's buttons.

partyofwon	2	0	I am not arguing that we should judge his character 15 years ago. I think considering character evidence at the time of the event is a very difficult and complicated issue. In fact, state laws differ significantly in the admissibility of a defendant's character evidence in criminal cases. My point is limited to listeners using Adnan's present character as evidence of his committing or not committing a past crime.	20141126T184006

That's just insane on the face of it. It's not insane at all. It happens all the time. Read any of these interviews from people who were wrongly convicted and released after serving 10 or 20 or 30 years. Almost none of them display any kind of outward anger, or rage, or anything. Most of them have spent the better part of their lives moving beyond it, mentally speaking, because it does no good. I mean, who wants to spend a couple of decades seething with rage that can't be released because you're in a prison cell, just to get let out and spoil what part of your life you have left on release from prison with more rage? People learn to move on, especially after reality sets in: my life has mostly been taken away from me and I cannot ever get it back no matter how much I try.

anonymous	12	0	*EDIT - I should preface this by saying that I do not have experience in post-conviction review. When my cases are resolved, they go to the file room and I never see them again barring the occasional post-trial motion practice or parole letter. So this is just an opinion gathered from my personal experiences and interactions with other prosecutors* Most convictions that are overturned 10, 20 or 30 years after the fact involve some sort of mistaken identification that is later overturned by DNA evidence. They don't involve known parties and one person lying, then later recanting. Not that it doesn't happen, but it's comparatively less frequent - especially when, logically speaking, the person committing the perjury is either the real murderer or an associate thereof. Also, don't forget that many convictions that are overturned don't necessarily mean that a person is innocent. Oftentimes witnesses that are tired of years or decades of pestering from defense attorneys will finally cave and recant just to end the pressure, or to assuage their guilt over sending someone to jail. Or a new trial will be ordered based on ineffective assistance or new evidence and the witnesses will refuse to come in because they're tired and don't want to go through the process again. Or evidence that used to exist will now be lost and destroyed and a new trial is impossible. In short, it's easy for some of these guys to say that they feel no ill will towards the people that put them away because they really are guilty! In my personal experience, although I don't handle old cases, I haven't seen this kind of forgiveness. One of my colleagues just indicted a guy for perjury - basically, for lying under oath to implicate someone he was afraid of in a shooting. The guy that had been sitting in jail for over a year certainly wasn't full of happiness and forgiveness. Rage and bitterness would be a more apt description.	20141126T205259
anonymous	12	0	"There has to be a defense theory to any case. The defendant need not testify, but the defense attorney has to present a reasonable view of the evidence that leads to a different conclusion. Otherwise, the defense is fighting a very uphill battle. In this case, it seems that the defense theory was that Jay is the real killer. That's a pretty huge stretch, considering the lack of any real evidence and any motive (for either the murder or for pinning on Adnan.) Given that he claims not to remember much of what happened that day, and since his testimony couldn't have advanced the defense theory, it makes sense that his attorney would advise him not to testify. What would be the point in him testifying? He might have slipped up and looked guilty or said something incriminating. But putting him on the stand would not have ""moved the ball"" so to speak, and that always has to be your metric for any potential evidence."	20141126T205620

anonymous	3	0	"Well yes, that's the theory. But in reality, there has to be one true series of events. Juries want to have an idea about what happened - they're extremely uncomfortable with the idea of listening for an entire trial and then just not knowing what happened. So it's usually not enough for the defense to say ""the evidence doesn't support their allegations because X,Y,Z."" Because in pretty much any case, you're going to have some strong evidence of guilt - an in-court ID, an admission, DNA, etc. So there has to be an explanation for that evidence that doesn't inculpate the defendant - yes, his DNA was there, but the sex was consensual, or yes, he shot him, but it was in self-defense, or yes, he ID'd the defendant, but he just did that because the lineup was suggestive. And even in a one-witness case like this one, it usually isn't enough to just say ""well, he's a liar and/or he's mistaken, so you should discredit him."" Juries generally won't do that - you have to have some logical explanation for what the truth is, assuming that he's lying. And in this case, the only logical explanation is that Jay killed Hae or assisted some other person in doing so, then framed Adnan - which doesn't make sense. So it's pretty safe to say that, in reality, if you're going to mount an effective defense, you have to be able to give the jury some kind of explanation for that evidence. They need something to believe in before they will acquit."	20141127T073210

partymuffell	1	0	It is a fact that someone testified something or other to be the case. A fact that needs to be accounted for like all other facts. We have to explain Jay's testimony whether we think it's true or it is false. If he lied we have to explain why he lied. Those pieces of evidence at most corroborate the hypothesis that he's guilty in my view, but they are not directly support the theory that he's guilty---they are too ambiguous. Too easy to explain away. In technical terms, their expectedness is too high.	20141126T222008
partymuffell	4	0	It's a fact that someone testified that something or other is the case, independently of whether their testimony is true or not. Every theory has to account for why Jay testified that Adnan killed Hae, independently of whether it is true that he did kill her.	20141126T221856

mail_kimp_sale	3	0	Well, I did tag it as speculation. I don't think there's anything wrong with looking for a motive and means for Jay as the murderer. Unless you assume it was premeditated, whoever did it had to come up with a plan right then and there. If the plan is to blame someone else with ties to the victim, it seems like a good idea to keep them close to you and then make it so that they don't really remember the details of what you did together on the day in question.	20141126T184057

(2/4/00-221) The first time [Jay] spoke to the police, he said he was not involved in killing or burying Hae. He said he lied to the police about the location of Hae's car. (2/10-66) He told the police that he saw Hae's body in a truck, not in the trunk of Hae's.Sentra. (2/10/00-76) [...] > On April 13, 1999, [Jay] gave a third statement to police. [...] [Jay] eventually took the police to where the body was buried and to where Hae's car was located.	20141126T185453

simonowens	53	0	You're wrong on one key thing: Jay did not go to the cops. The cops found him via the call logs to his friend. Jay was backed into a corner and forced to tell a story. Also, he had no idea that Adnan didn't have an alibi, and that's precisely why he told the cops that he dropped Adnan off at track practice so he would have an alibi. He was anticipating that Adnan would have someone on the track team verify he was there and was trying to preemptively discredit that alibi. In some ways this has backfired because SK has been able to pretty definitively prove that there's no way Adnan could have made it back to track practice on time.	20141126T190146
anonymous	29	0	I think what it comes down to is reasonable doubt. Was Adnan proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt? Based on what I've heard (which I'm sure is different from what the jury heard), no, he wasn't. He might be guilty, but I think the evidence isn't good enough to prove him guilty beyond reasonable doubt. It's innocent until proven guilty, not vice versa.	20141126T193315
anonymous	8	0	Did Adnan kill Hae? My gut says yes. Is Adnan guilty according to the law? Not with the evidence presented at trial and so far In my opinion.	20141126T234628
Solvang84	22	0	"Wrong. Perfectly plausible that Jay did it and Adnan was the unwitting, coerced accomplice, and the whole thing boils down to Jay confessing first to save his own ass. And the more I look at the evidence, the more I lean toward that. And even if Adnan did it, the premeditation angle is as bogus as the 2:36 timeline, which in and of itself makes this a newsworthy case: A flimsy, circumstantial manslaughter case against a minor child was trumped up into a first-degree murder conviction, as an adult, with a mandatory sentence of life without parole, secured largely through a completely bogus timeline supported by a lying star witness, misinformed jurors (trusted Jay because they falsely beleived he was gettign no deal and woudl do time), corrupt jurors (openly admit ignoring jury instructions re: presumption of innocence and right against self-incrimination), completley unethical courtroom histrionics (e.g. having Hae's friends take the stand to perform - yes, perform - teary-eyed readings of Hae's diary passages that had zero to do with the crime and served only to inflame the jury), and a healthy dose of good ol' bigotry (painting Adnan as some cartoonish seething, crazy Muslim man who saw Hae as a devil-temptress who had lured him into a sinful double life he never wanted, and killed her as revenge for bringing dishonor and embarassment upon him and his family). But back to Jay: - I'm convinced that Jay, at the very least, was present for the murder. If Hae was killed near Woodlawn at around 3:00, Jay has no alibi for that time, he conspired with Jenn to create a false alibi for that time (both of them claiming he was at Jenn's until 3:30 or 4:00), the call records prove his alibi false, and the pings place him near Woodlawn. - Motive: You don't know if Jay had a motive or not, you don't know what beefs existed in that group of frineds (no, they were not just ""casual aquaintances,"" they obviosuly all spent a lot of time together), and it's grasping at straws to claim that Adnan had a motive to kill her when there was zero evidence that he was even angry with her. Once you know that Jay admists knowledge and involvement in the crime, looking at which one of them had more of a ""natural motive"" is just statistical noise. - Jay showed a strategy from the get-go of trying to get out in front of the story and get his version out there: ""Adnan did it, I was just an accessory"". He blabbed immediately to Jenn, then to Chris, then he sent Jenn to the cops to tell his version, then dramatically ""came clean"" and told his version. Which woudl be one thing if he was trying to get the truth out there, but he lied and fabricated and changed virtually every part of the story other than ""Adnan did it; I was just an accessory"" - most notably, as mentioned, attempting to create a false alibi for himself for the actual time of the murder. So, yeah, Jay definitely could have done it."	20141126T200956

smithjo1	2	0	"Maybe ""irrelevant"" is a little strong, but I tend to agree. The evidence makes it more probable than not that Adnan had involvement with the killing and disposal of Hae. Part of the problem is that Jay tries to fabricate a story to the cops that minimizes his involvement (that he's just an innocent bystander who's blackmailed into helping Adnan). But, as expected, these half-truths don't add up. Listeners have then fixated on these half-truths, thinking that they prove that Jay committed the murder solo. But that's quite a logical leap, and the remainder of the evidence doesn't tend to show that."	20141126T192335

Her body had already been found, right? Jay knew that he was going to get questioned and that it was possible that he could be a person of interest. I may not be remembering this perfectly, but wasn't Jenn told ""everyone's a suspect and no one's a suspect""? Enough to make her think that they could be coming after her. At that point, Jay could have realized that he had to push it off on someone else. And he spent enough time with Adnan that day to know that he didn't have much of an alibi and was stoned out of his mind for part of the day."	20141126T212404
Hardaknut	3	0	The detail that most incriminates Adnan for me, lately, is that two people remember Adnan asking Hae for a ride because his car was in the shop, and a police officer who talked to Adnan the day of the disappearance says Adnan himself said at first that he asked Hae for a ride because his car was in the shop. Since his car was not actually in any shop, it sure seems that Adnan was looking for a pretext to be in her car. And that slots right in to Jay's overall story.	20141210T171859
thewamp	8	0	"Literally every point here is debatable/wrong. This is wildly oversimplifying. It's real life, not CSI - the puzzle pieces don't fit together. 1) Or the cops told Jay Adnan did it and helped him to come up with a story to implicate Adnan. These are cops that have a history of corruption. 2) No, his cell phone doesn't ping in the park. It pings in a large area that the park - and many other places - fall in. Also, the way cell phone technology, there's not even a guarantee he was in that area. 3) Or someone else and Jay is covering for them (Stephanie?) or none of the above and the cops coerced jay, or etc. a) Had no motive that we know of unless you count the cheating on Stephanie who he was obsessed with thing. Which a) is a much better motive than ""broke up with 3 months ago"", b) could also just mean that we don't know the full picture because the investigation was woefully incomplete. And he has six weeks to make sure Adnan didn't have an abili so there wasn't any real risk and he had a super super obvious reason to give the police the story he gave - he got no jail time. If he was involved for real in any way he was at risk of jail time so this got him out of it. b) I don't think you're using ""refute"" correctly. He refutes the story categorically. Doesn't admit to being in park and there's no evidence of this (except Jay's testimony - the cell phone records do not show this). Not accusing someone when you don't know what's going on is not proof of anything. This case isn't simple. He may be guilty but it absolutely isn't simple."	20141126T204648
Mattney	4	0	"I think this is very well said. I was in the ""innocent"" camp for the first four episodes or so, but I came to basically these same conclusions, and it's been ""guilty"" ever since. Of course, there are many who will try to refute your first point, both with the serial killer theory by pointing to Roy Davis, which has no evidence or basis in fact other than he also killed an Asian woman in the area. And they will claim that the police fed Jay the entire story, which, overwhelming evidence of police corruption notwithstanding, is ridiculous. I mean, do people really believe that the police found the car and sat on it, not processing it at all, until they could find someone to put it on? Their reasoning for the frame job is that the police just want to clear the case, no matter what. So would they sit on perhaps the greatest piece of evidence in the case? What if they did that and then evidence in the car contradicted their story? What if there was a piece of evidence in the car that directly pointed, beyond a shadow of a doubt, to a suspect? It's just ridiculous to think that these policemen, under tons of pressure to solve the case, would sit on evidence like that, unable to process or search it, until they got a patsy. Simply ridiculous. So yes, Jay was involved. And Adnan's cell phone ringing in Leakin Park during the exact time Jay says they were burying the body? During a time when Adnan says he had his phone back and no one else can account for his whereabouts? They'll say that those towers cover a large area, and it could be anywhere in the direction indicated, blah blah. But let's be realistic. I would love to be proven wrong, and if I am, I'll gladly admit it, but in my opinion, it's pretty clear."	20141126T185630

joppy77	2	0	"The facts you listed have are what have convinced me of Adnan's guilt almost since the beginning (with some slight swaying as the show's drama sucked me in). On top of those things, the fact that Adnan voluntarily offered his car and phone to Jay (for questionable reasons) on this particular day of the murder is wildly suspect. What are the odds that on this very day when Adnan decided to lend his acquaintance Jay his car and phone *also happened to be the day* that either: a) Hae, Adnan's recent ex, confronted Jay, someone she barely knew, about something that drove him to murder her, or b) Jay or someone he knew decided to murder Hae for other unknown reasons. In either of these cases, we're supposed to believe that Jay happened to have Adnan's car and phone, and therefore the perfect ex-boyfriend suspect to ""frame"" for the murder? An ex-boyfriend with a motive who didn't have an alibi? I feel like that is a degree of coincidence that extends beyond what a reasonable person could believe without some very compelling explanation. And Adnan cannot provide that... not even close. Most of his case is built on likability and 'nice guy' charm, not facts. But with all of that said, the legal end of things is a different issue. I do think there were some big injustices done. Even if they got the right guy, multiple failed to do their jobs with integrity. And they let an active participant in the crime go free, as well as another person who was tangentially involved."	20141127T001920

reddit1101	2	0	Agreed. The show makes you wonder at the beginning but when you stick to the facts and accounts presented, it is really simple. If there is no hard evidence, any case could be made into a whodunit scenario. Add in some inconsistencies (most cases have them, people are not robots), Adnan's charismatic character, and -viola- you have created doubt in people's minds. To make people second guess for entertainment value is dangerous because we're talking about a real murder here and a conviction. (For the record, I obviously willingly listened. Guilty there.) Do not be swayed by irrelevant, improbable details and outlandish plot lines. It's simple. Adnan strangled Hae, Jay was a co-conspirator. Jay tried to minimize his involvement, Adnan didn't want to admit to anything. He's sticking to that because he can't come out now or ever. He has supporters who send him money and visit him, etc. That's it. How I came to this conclusion - http://redd.it/2nnrxx	20141129T174419
stravoskoiladitis	3	0	Mostly agree and I have been thinking on the same lines myself. My line of thinking goes more like this: Jay was involved (he knew the location of Hae's car). Adnan says that he knew nothing about Hae's disappearance, never been to Leakin par etc. and yet, he chooses this very day to hand his cell phone and his car to the very person that was involved in Hae's disappearance! A person who -if I understand correctly- was not his best friend, was not a person he mostly hang out with. I mean, what is this, a freak coincidence or what? At the very least I would expect SK to quiz Adnan really hard about it during their phone conversations, yet listening to those conversations this point is like the elephant in the room: doesn't get mentioned at all! I would also add that, so far, the show has, basically, been making a case for investigating a whole bunch of things further. That is the essence of what the real professionals, like Deirdree (whose name I'm sure I'm horribly misspelling) who have been on the show have said. Which, in a way is fine: sure, go on, investigate, if you've got the resources and time and inclination; there is nothing one could say against further investigation. But there is no guarantee that it would actually turn up something in Adnan's favour. I don't wish to be misunderstood here: I'm not in the anti-Adnan camp or anything, I do not wish the man ill, if it turns out that he is innocent and/or wrongfully convicted I would gladly eat my words but, so far, I really can't see a way around the legitimate objections mentioned by the original poster and the ones I have mentioned.	20141126T193458
Trendy2	4	0	"At this point, I agree. I'm re-listening this week to all of the episodes. Adnan murdered Hae. I don't know where it happened, the Best Buy parking lot seems far-fetched but it doesn't really matter where the murder took place. Jay was involved and likely to a much bigger extent than it sounds because he's minimalizing his involvement to stay out of jail. He's leaving out lots of details in his interviews with police and we'll never know what really happened that fateful afternoon/evening - only Jay and Adnan know what really happened and when it happened. For me, some key points are 1.)The Nisha Call (capitalized title for SK) - it puts Jay and Adnan together at a time Adnan says he's at school/library; 2.)when Adnan calls Jay ""pathetic"" at trial; 3.)CathynotCathy's statements - she's fairly impartial and it also puts Jay and Adnan together, plus acting very strangely that night. That's where I'm at after listening thus far. I've never really seen Adnan as innocent. In my mind he's guilty.

donailin1	1	0	I've been saying this since I listened to it the first time around. There's plenty of intrigue but the big picture tells the story. Adnan is a skilled liar and manipulator (more now than ever), Jay not so much. They both had a hand in it, but only one wanted Hae dead. Adnan is exactly where he belongs. Now if someone wants to argue that Adnan should have gotten off if only he had a better more competent attorney, than I would say sure, he should have had George Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara -- he would surely have gotten Adnan off. But that would also mean that Adnan, a murderer would have gotten away with it. Justice is being served. (edited for sp. and clarity.)	20141127T002634

Hopper80	1	0	Jay said he was involved, to an extent. I thought Adnan was at the mosque while his mobile was pinging around the park? Jay has no motive that we know of. Doesn't mean he didn't have one, or that he necessarily needed one. Adnan has a motive of sorts. But to assume guilt on the strength of that motive is question begging. If he's the kind of person to kill an ex, then the motive holds. If he isn't, it doesn't. To prove the motive, you ought to prove the act. It hasn't been. The 'entire case' isn't worth the back of the beermat it was worked out on. This is the problem. Jay said Adnan did it. There are a number of scenarios were he might make that up. Adnan can't prove he didn't do it. I think there's a lot of things I can't prove I didn't do. I would hope the onus would be on my accusers to prove I did them. Lisa: 'Nuke the whales'!

Furthermore, if we accept the Leakin Park pings as 100% accurate, why do we pretend the rest of the pings are *inaccurate*? The pings are inconsistent with the rest of Jay's story... The pings therefore are not a ""smoking gun"" as you have put it. >**Doesn't accuse Jay of killing Hae.** First, we only hear edited bits of what Adnan has said to SK. It is possible he has, indeed, made this accusation. The only thing we know for sure is that Adnan has stated he wouldn't know why Jay would do such a thing -- he suspects it may have something to do with his relationship with Stephanie but that's all he has to go off of. Furthermore, as much as we all like to play arm chair psychologists, it's hard for any of us to predict how we would behave after 15 years in prison. This is weak and is not evidence at all.

Same thing with Jay's testimony, you have to take it through the lens of it being the testimony of someone who is trying to minimize their involvement and recounting something that happened weeks ago. It's absolutely flawed and complicated, but throwing it out because of its flaws is to ignore valuable evidence.	20141126T184447

All that matters is whether they found Jay credible when he said that Adnan admitted to killing Hae. If they did, then that's sufficient for a conviction.

thewamp	3	0	That's not how cell phones work. Sometimes cell phones ping the right towers, sometimes they don't. Pinging the appropriate tower sometimes doesn't mean that always happens. ALSO, the call does not come from Leakin. So even if you reject that, the call comes from the vague vicinity of Leakin. It's a large area. That's also not how causality works. You can't say Kathy's house matched with cell phone ping, ergo all cell phone pings match cell phone location. It doesn't go both ways (or actually either). Lastly there's not even any proof that he was at these places. He's guessing based on the exact same information you are - the cell information. So if you try to use any of this as proof it's circular logic: Adnan looks at cell records, makes statements based on them, you make a conclusions about the cell records based on his statements.	20141127T000355

They go to Jay, who confirms it (rather than say that she's totally out of her mind, or something). Why would he do all those things, if he was the one who did it, or if he wanted to cover fir someone else?

Also, it's not on the defense to prove innocence, but it helps to give the jury an alternate theory to crime.

anonymous	8	0	It's not common, but not very surprising given the interviews with the jurors. They believed Jay, and that was enough to convict.

Just seems a little too suspicious that most of these calls that coordinate with the statements/stories of Jay and Adnan himself are all good but some don't, especially the Leakin Park calls.

The only evidence linking Adnan to Hae's murder was Jay's testimony, which was self-serving, inconsistent with other evidence, and curiously evolved to fit the state's theory of the case. That does not satisfy any rational definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. And as far the defense convincing the jury that someone else did it, I can't swear to the rules of evidence in Maryland but generally speaking, a criminal defendant is not permitted to introduce evidence that someone else committed the crime he is being charged with unless he can establish a direct connection - meaning more than just motive or opportunity.	20141127T011452

Ah, but the problem is, that's not what's happening here. This isn't a **single tower case** with Adnan's phone. There were three towers at Leakin Park pinged that night, not one. And it happened over an extended period of time. This increases the likelihood of the phone being in that area. > Edward J. Imwinkelried, a law professor at the University of California at Davis who co-authored a treatise on scientific evidence, says **cell tower records are not completely worthless.** Thoughts on this? > They still were allowed to put on evidence showing that **Evans’ phone repeatedly connected to two cell towers directly east and west of his aunt’s home.** So they did allow it, actually, because it repeatedly connected to the same towers, therefore increasing the chance that it was in a general area. This is not unlike the situation we have with Adnan's cell phone, which, once again, pinged more than one tower in this area repeatedly over a period of roughly 60-90 minutes. > But Mark Eckenwiler, until recently the Justice Department’s primary authority on electronic surveillance, says **cell tower records, while no smoking gun, can provide reliable and highly probative evidence of a defendant’s guilt or innocence.** And anybody who says otherwise, he says, “is trying to sell you a bill of goods.” Thoughts? > In the brief he co-authored, Eckenwiler said that **cell tower records can provide a “general indication” of where a call was made down to *within a few hundred yards* under certain conditions,** but was “too imprecise” to place a caller inside a constitutionally protected space, such as **a home.** Again, not the same thing as the Adnan case. Don't think I really have to repeat myself here. > But Eckenwiler says the suggestion that Judge Lefkow’s ruling somehow “sounds the death knell” for cell tower evidence is **“just silly.”** So your expert here even agrees that to flat out rule this kind of evidence out is, in his own words, ""silly."" > He says the decision suggests only that the judge felt the prosecution’s expert “hadn’t done his homework,” a conclusion Eckenwiler says after having read her opinion he would probably agree with. Once again, this is more about the process of the courts, and not any kind of scientific conclusion. The argument from the defense and judge is that the evidence as presented was not admissible. Yet, the judge still allowed a cell expert to testify how it works and how it could reveal a person was in a general area, especially if a tower was pinged multiple times. Now from an actual [academic paper](http://jolt.richmond.edu/v18i1/article3.pdf) on the subject: > Another method of tracking the location of cellular telephones, which also is sometimes called triangulation, is possible when a phone transmits signals to **three antenna towers at once.** Based on the strength of a phone's signal to a tower, and the time delay for the signal to reach the tower, one can determine the distance between the phone and the tower. One can then draw around the tower a circle, the radius of which is the distance from that tower to the phone. **The location of the phone can be pinpointed** by drawing circles around three of [sic] more towers and seeing where the circles intersect. From the conclusion: > Cell site data can track the location of cellular phones if enough information is available to perform triangulation.230 However, the accuracy of triangulation depends on multiple factors, from the duration of the call to the geography of the region.231 The interpretation of historical cell site data can prove a useful investigative tool, if law enforcement properly recognizes its limits.232 From such information, law enforcement can determine the general coverage area from which a phone call was placed, but not the precise location within that area.233 Historical cell site data can also show that a call was not made from a certain area.234 Again, it can't exactly place someone in an exact address, but we can get a general area using the records. We don't need to place Adnan's phone at the exact coordinates of the burial site, but using the technology we have a pretty good idea he was within the vicinity of it. So if you're requirement for ""junk science"" is that we can't place Adnan's phone at the exact point of the burial, I guess you're right. It's not 100% exact. But it's damn close. When the data repeats itself, as it does here, it gets even closer. And for that matter, fingerprints aren't 100% correct 100% of the time, either. I mean, even in this case, we have Adnan's fingerprints in Hae's car, which could be interpreted two ways: He was there the day of the murder, or he'd been in the car multiple times. We can't really say which is true with absolute certainty, but I don't think you'd argue fingerprints, in general, are ""junk science."" A few questions: If the cell data is junk, why, when Adnan admits to being at Cathy's, do each of the calls received there ping the towers by Cathy's and nowhere else? Or what about the roughly dozen or so calls Adnan makes from his home that night, that all ping the towers by his house? **EDITED** to bold some points I felt were important. **EDIT 2:** How about instead of multiple down votes, we engage in conversation about this?"	20141126T201359

AMAathon	2	0	Or Jay's testimony is unreliable but Adnan is still guilty. The reason you focus on the Leakin Park pings is because from about 6pm on that day, four different people testify to Adnan having his phone in his possession. Jay, Cathy, Cathy's boyfriend, Officer Adcock, and Adnan himself. In Episode 9, Krista also throws herself into the mix but she's not sure. It's also possible Hae's brother called him, too. So we know that from 6pm on he has his phone, and that within 30 minutes of speaking to the police his cell phone pings multiple towers at Leakin Park multiple times. The afternoon narrative can be faulty and Adnan can still be guilty. I agree we don't have the full truth about when and where Hae was killed, but that doesn't automatically exonerate Adnan.	20141126T222948

Workforidlehands	1	0	"When I puzzle about true crime stories I always take the approach that any of the ""evidence"" has the potential to be dismissed as nonsense purely from my knowledge of other cases. (Eg Randall Adams, Darryl Hunt, The Guilford Four etc) In this case the only indisputable fact appears to be that Jay was involved in some way - and not because he admitted that but because he led detectives to her car which they had been unable to find. However even this has potential to be unreliable. There are plenty of cases where a convict has confessed to a murder they had nothing to do with and there could be an entire layer of narrative to this story that has never risen to the surface. At the moment I'm just in the camp that thinks the case was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. I think the biggest mistake by the defence was choosing not to let Adnan take the stand. While a jury is instructed not to infer anything from this - they clearly do. Adnan is as eloquent and persuasive as Jay so the jury would probably have been left not knowing who to believe rather than only having one protagonist to choose to believe.

Cell tower data is complicated. And it needs to be interpreted in it's proper context (which the expert witnesses and the experts that Sarah contacted attested to it being done properly in this case.) But that complexity doesn't mean that it's meaningless. Your tool can tell me that I was on reddit. It can't tell me what subreddit, but that doesn't mean that it is, as people have been saying time and time again on this sub, junk science. You still know I was on reddit! That's useful! It's data with limitations, and throwing it out because it has limitations is nonsense that has similarities to the arguments made by people who deny our ability to predict climate change because of the uncertainties inherent to our predictions.	20141127T045152

You didn't, but you agreed with Dr__Nick. aroras said this: > You're leaping to the presumption that the cell phone tower pings triangulate his location. This has been refuted time and again. The cell phone tower pings can only tell you a radius that the phone is within, which unfortunately, covers the majority of the area (including park, school, etc.) As SK stated in the relevant episode, there is science behind ping technology.....but you can easily MISAPPLY the science and lead to faulty conclusions. and monster_mouse told him that this science is wrong. > 3 experts haven't refuted the cell phone data, the podcast hasn't refuted the cell phone data, it's only a few guys hanging around this subreddit who think it's total junk. So what did he mean? I understood that he disagrees with aroras and means that it's very much possible to explain that the cell phone was at Leakin park. Why else would he disagree so forceful. You wrote: > It's data with limitations, but throwing it out because it has limitations is nonsense that has similarities to the arguments made by people who deny our ability to predict climate change.

bugelman	2	0	yes, agree. the 8:04 and 8:05 pages to Jenn are Jay (who has abandoned Hae's car off Edmonson Avenue at the spot he later showed it to police) asking Jenn to come pick him up at a pre-arranged location-- Jae was alone and had no way of getting back and getting rid of the shovels and other evidence if he was on foot, so he needed a ride. Adnan was at the Mosque the whole time. Adnan's recollection that he thought he had the phone the whole time was a mistake -- he was stone -- it takes no great leap as suggested by the OP that Adnan couldn't be wrong with his recollection of who had the phone. Evidence looks pretty bad for Jay -- if the burial really involved Adnan, why would Jay be paging an outside party right after they committed the crime? It would be extremely strange for the two of them to have allowed a third party into the fold when they could have pulled off the evidence disposal on their own. The obvious explanation is that Jay needed a ride because he was alone.	20141126T195010

goliath_franco	1	0	The podcast hasn't told us anything about this. It came up in [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2l2nk2/credit_card_debit_card_details_more_needed_on_the/) a while ago, and [someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2l2nk2/credit_card_debit_card_details_more_needed_on_the/clqyy0l) pointed out that credit card transaction are sometimes delayed several days. So it's not even clear to me whether the credit card was actually used on the day she died. I *thought* I saw someone comment somewhere that Rabia and company still wanted to look into this credit card transaction further, which would mean that it was never really looked into before the trial or since. But I can't find that comment, and I'm not sure whether or not my memory is correct on this point.	20141127T092711

icase81	3	0	Yeah, back in the late 90's, gas stations would put a hold on your card when you swiped for like, $50 or $75 and then the next day release the hold and charge the proper amount.	20141127T000240

Milhouse242	2	0	"But is it possible for someone who was trying to ""throw off the trail"" steal it on purpose to make a charge at a random time? Idk.

fakerjohn	2	0	I can't recall where it was either but I recall reading, maybe in court docs, that Jay said Adnan sort of flipped through the wallet's cards for a minute at some point. It stuck out as an odd detail.	20141126T222314
TheDelightfulMs	3	0	This is a good question, also. The only thing I can say to even remotely answer the question is that I was also in high school back then and I worked at a restaurant. I never once checked ID for credit cards and debit cards were fairly new and always run as credit cards, which I also never checked ID for. Sorry to anyone who had pizza charges from a stolen credit card in the late 90s.	20141127T000114

biochem_nerd	1	0	Having searched for dumpster, mainly what I could find is references to Jay dumping the shovels and *his* clothes, and then revisiting to wipe prints off the shovels. The only references I could find to her stuff in a dumpster is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2mdhga/that_one_sad_detail_the_park_and_ride_and_why_i/).

glammer17	2	0	maybe he just meant his prints off the shovels - but wasn't adnan supposedly wearing gloves? Wouldn't he continue to wear them/put them back on to dig? Especially considering it was winter and cold enough to snow the next day...Also, if it was a dumpster and he returned... he would have to literally get into the dumpster and dig through everything to find the shovels. Seems like someone would've easily spotted that happening.	20141127T010505

dev1anter	2	0	a dude who researched him came listen these >When you look into his record you see that Jay plead guilty to accessory after the fact of 1st degree murder and he was sentenced to a five year suspended sentence and 2 years probation. This would mean that if he violates probation or the conditions of his plea deal he would go to prison for five years. Jay was charged with a slew of various crimes while he would have been on probation. Most of these charges were dropped but he was even found guilty of a few and didn't go to prison, just gets sentenced with more probation without a conviction. Much later, after his probation term would have ended, he was charged with 5 counts of assault, 2 of those counts are assault on a police officer. Plus two charges of resisting arrest. The court file names two cops who say he assaulted them and three more who witnessed this event. All those charges get dropped too	20141126T215101

Jay specifically said he saw him standing at the corner of the building next to the payphone.	20141126T201259
asha24	0	0	SK isn't an amateur, they looked into this, if there was a payphone in the lobby there would have been records, it would have been much easier to prove. Also, a payphone in the lobby would mean there's no way it could have been the old Ramada payphone.	20141126T213650

mgooch	0	0	Pretty much anything seems possible since so little is actually known.

fourlions	1	0	While it may seem like a slip-of-the-tongue, you must remember that Adnan stated he has read over his case many times as well. He probably has the story provided by the state imprinted in his mind and it's easy for him to recall.	20141130T191717

DrRaulDuke	1	0	That's just it. The states case, both of them, talked about the phone as being in the parking lot. The lobby was only brought up later by SK and the friend that called/emailed her.	20141130T212520
Spedgal1	1	0	I just read Jay's interview and he never mentioned the lobby. Where was it mentioned by the state? Anyone have reference?

fourlions	2	0	Oh right. Again he may just be assuming that's what they meant when they talk about a phone at BestBuy. I think with all these it shows how difficult it is to trust anything anybody says	20141130T213104

nacho-bitch	2	0	My two favorite theories: 1. Jay has the car and decides to try to find Stephanie after school to give her her present. The cell records suggest that he is near the school in the afternoon. Hae sees him and confronts him about cheating on Stephanie. Things get heated and he accidentally kills her. 2. A asks Hae for a ride because Jay has his car and phone. Hae says sure because she knows she can quickly drop him off before she goes to get her cousin. Later she realizes that she can reach Jay on A's phone and give him shit for cheating on Steph. She calls him and somehow he convinces her to meet him at Best Buy to talk this out. She tells A she can't give him a ride after all and goes to talk to Jay. Things get heated and he kills her by accident.	20141127T045815
texlaw999	1	0	I kind of rushed through these scenarios but I think there different things that could have happened each on their own somewhat improbably but collectively more probable that the idea that Adnan plotted and then strangled his ex-girlfriend, then contacted a casual acquaintance who also happened to be a drug dealer, and then with a dead body in the back of the trunk went and bought more drugs. I also do not think it is hard to leap to the idea that Mr S, a sexual deviant who jacked off in front of a police officer and then called the police to report his clothes missing, would be involved in a murder and then go to the police to tell them about the murder.	20141126T230126

Irkeley	1	0	I went back and looked at the phone log. Adnan and Hae didn't talk until 12.35 am, and she was not home at 12.01 am (I assume), due to the missed call. She could have been at the gas station 30 minutes away that night and still made it back for the 12.35 phone call.	20141127T140501

I never should have been friends with these people who-- who else can I blame but myself? Doesn't sound like he's disputing it. EDIT: Obviously, there is probably a disagreement over who prompted this, though. I think Jay pretty clearly says Adnan gave it to him on purpose as part of the murder plan. Adnan appears to be suggesting that Jay asked to borrow the phone.	20141126T214637

The same situation happened in one of the TAL episodes that was recommended listening and I finally got to a couple days ago. The police evidence department (whatever it's called) said that some evidence in a case was destroyed, but when the IP team went and checked the evidence themselves, they found that it was still available.	20141128T231544

springandall	7	0	I don't see the crush like others do, I just see a cautious, tactful reporter. As a woman, it's difficult. You're a little more likely to get thrown in a box. Among the stereotypes a woman in her position would get cast in are the mother/savior role, the amorous, naive role and the ball buster, none of which she lives up to completely in my mind. She seems like a pretty real, well-rounded person to me, and I think it's a stretch to say she's infatuated from what little we have. I'm pretty sure she's got a family of her own and a huge job to do. I see her being swayed by Adnan's nicety and charm, but not romantically inclined toward them. I'd like to think she's better at her job than that and give her some credit. I don't down vote for any reason, so you can discuss the crush with me, even though I 95% disagree. :)	20141126T233346

Superben14	1	0	I can believe that Jay killed Hae, but I don't buy the idea that it was premeditated with a plan to frame Adnan all along. It relies on a ton of luck on Jay's part (getting the car and cell phone from Adnan, getting Hae alone, etc) and a lot of stupidity (why not make up a consistent story?) These problems go away if Jay borrows Adnan's car, runs into Hae by chance, and strangles her (in a crime of passion).	20141127T045423
Eskimo_Cartel	1	0	If Stephanie was Jay's love of his life, why did Adnan have to remind him to get her a birthday present? When I heard that it made me think that they weren't in a very tight relationship.	20141127T170413
eltormento	0	0	Why does it take luck for Jay to get the phone? Jay is crafty. And the car...Jay is tricky and someone Adnan trusts. Plus, Jay is a good actor and liar, he could easily convince Hae of *any* story that would get her in the car with him. I think he felt bad later about killing Hae, but the only passion he felt had to do with safeguarding his relationship with the greatest love of his life, his heart's salvation--Stephanie. Hae was a necessary sacrifice. I guarantee people's minds work this way (especially in high school). The key is to find a way to confirm this could be a motive for Jay. Stephanie would be an important person to depose about this. But once you have this motive, everything adds up. It would have been great to have put Jay on a polygraph. When they play the tape of them asking if he killed Hae...his denial sounded so false to me. Too bad there wasn't the foresight to consider him a real suspect and put him on a polygraph.	20141127T053259
eltormento	2	0	"Frankly, that call from Adnan could have actually been the straw that broke the camel's back. Think of it from Jay's point of view. Jay's a self-centered dude, he loves Stephanie, but he's not really thoughtful. And he's been stewing about how she's been looking at Adnan since the break-up with Hae. Now, Adnan out of the blue, goes out of his way to call and double-check that Jay's treating his girlfriend right? When Jay says he hasn't, I'm sure Adnan might have scolded him a bit before telling him to borrow his car and go out to get a present. This would rub salt into the wound and further reinforce to Jay that Adnan would be a better boyfriend for Stephanie. So, Jay takes the car, but he's stewing the whole time, and he thinks to himself... I know *exactly* what would shut down Adnan for good... I've got his car, all I have to do is get his cell-phone (this is easy, Adnan's not expecting attack from Jay) and I can pin something on him that will remove him from Stephanie's life forever. It's actually kind of like Othello in a twisted sort of way. Male jealousy is a potent and vicious thing. It's actually too bad that Adnan and Jay weren't *better* friends. They were good enough friends for Adnan to trust Jay, but not good enough that Jay wouldn't resent Adnan for being the perfect guy to potentially steal his beautiful and intelligent girlfriend. He saw Adnan as a ""player"". And when Jay concocted his story he immediately tried to discredit Adnan with Stephanie, saying that he controlled Jay by casually threatening Stephanie's life. C'mon! There is no precedent for him to do that. It is *so* far-fetched, but makes perfect sense if you realize why Jay created this fiction in the first place. ---- Here are the details about the birthday call for reference, read this with the **""Jay, as the jealous 'Iago'""** Theory in mind --- Adnan Calls Jay to Ask if Jay Has Gotten a Present for Stephanie Adnan’s Story: According to Adnan, he calls Jay from school, to make sure Jay remembered to get a birthday present for his girlfriend, Stephanie. Adnan and Stephanie are also close friends, and he did not want her to be upset if Jay forgot to get her something: “I kind of had a feeling that maybe he didn’t get her a gift. And I had free periods during school. So it was not abnormal for me to leave school to go do something and then come back. So I went to his house. And I asked him, did you happen to get a present for Stephanie? He said no. So I said, if you want to, you can drop me back off to school. You can borrow my car. And you can go to the mall and get her a gift or whatever. Then just come pick me up after track practice that day.” (Episode 1.) Jay’s Story: According to Jay, Adnan went with Jay to get the gift for Stephanie: “[I] went shopping with a friend of mine, an ex-friend of mine, Adnan. We had had a conversation. During the conversation he stated that he was going to kill that bitch, referring to Hae Lee. . . . We left the mall. I took him to school. I dropped him off in the back of the school. He went up to class. He left his cell phone in the car with me, told me he’d call me. I went back to my friend Jenn’s house and waited for him to call.” (Jay’s 3/15/99 Interview.) Jay’s stories about what mall he and Adnan went to are not consistent, however, as he names two different locations: “[W]e headed toward Westview mall. Um, we did a little shopping together.” (Jay’s 2/28/99 Interview.) “We went to Security Square Mall.” (Jay’s 3/15/99 Interview.)"	20141127T174426

anonymous	3	0	We don't know why Asia turned Hae didn't give him a ride she canceled it, she had 50min to get cousin but didn't leave school till 3pm Yes probably at best buy or the library seeing she missed the 3:15 pick up but only two people know for sure. I think Jay sent Steph balloons first thing in the morning and Stephanie was busy till 11:30 no idea if she got the bracelet. Stephanie clearly thinks Adnan killed her friends so that's why she cut him out. The note could have been tampered with but the handwriting matches. It could have been later but Jay mentions the call at his second interview so not very likely. The mosque was after 8pm all the mcD's trips would have been past sundown. Cops found Jay though the call log when they interviewed Jen she led them to Jay Rabia is a partisan advocate, she has spent 15 years on this case. I would hope she has some decent alternative theories but without proof they are no good.	20141126T232304

Common themes tend to be hating Rabia without much explanation why, ""Adnan is guilty because he is guilty. He killed Hae because he killed Hae"", and arguing for the sake of arguing. I have come to the conclusion that they simply say Adnan is guilty because they want to go against the majority saying Adnan is innocent. It feels like they just want to do whatever is the opposite of what everyone else is doing.

szsunni	6	0	The theory isn't Rabia's. It was actually created by a follower of the series and uses the call logs, cell towers, and testimonies to piece it together. About Stephanie, I guess maybe that could be why she cut him out, but for being so close, don't you think she would try to at least speak to Adnan once to find out what happened, or even to yell at him or something? She seemed to have shut everyone out and refused to speak to everyone, including her friends. The only person she remained in contact with seemed to be Jay. Maybe he told her to cut everyone out?	20141126T233614

szsunni	3	0	I read the post and I thought it was great! Susan really breaks down Jay's testimonies and to see it all written down is much more powerful than simply hearing them. I found myself getting lost while trying to understand all of his lies. And I think when a possible motive (Jay's infidelity) gets thrown in there, Jay starts to look a lot more guilty than Adnan. I'm not 100% sure where people read about his cheating, but it seems to be a good source because I've heard about it from many. I just don't understand how anyone could consider Jay a credible witness.	20141127T031557

tristanweary	2	0	"At the time she asked Asia write out a statement and have it notarized, she was just a law student, if I'm remembering it correctly. And Asia's statement does sound very coached.

zati1	2	0	You're confusing the affidavit for the letter(s) Asia wrote Adnan immediately after the arrest	20141127T115636

RichTea88	6	0	Just a point of curiosity, everyone who has been questioned about Jay and Stephanie has said 'He'd Move Heaven and Hearth' for her, or that she was his amazing thing in life... So amazing that he'd leave getting her a gift until the day of her actual birthday? So amazing that he'd spend most of the day with Adnan's phone calling Jenn but not once call her? So amazing that he doesn't see her all day but gets himself involved in the murder of one of her good friends and can't even keep it quiet enough that he tells another person that same night? Doesn't add up to me.	20141127T130348
mudmanor	4	0	Yes and what struck me was Jay saying he and Adnan started out the day by going shopping. Does that mean that Adnan had no morning classes? Aren't most stores closed until 10 AM? I just can't imagine a guy getting up earlier he needs to to get to school just to hang out in the stores with a friend. Did Jay get her a gift? According to his last version of events for the 13th, he didn't see her until 11:30 P.M. when he arrived with Jenn. What else did he have to do all day on her birthday that was so important? What about store security cameras? I guess the police felt they had the evidence(Jay's coached confession) they needed for conviction so didn't need to do further investigating. As further documented on http://viewfromll2.com/. Be sure and check out her last TWO posts.	20141126T233021
cottonbiscuit	1	0	And do we ever find out what he actually gets her? They mentioned Adnan's present was a stuffed reindeer multiple times.	20141127T065105
Irkeley	1	0	The cell records show that Jay was on his way to the Woodlawn Highschool area at the 2.36 phone call (just south of the school), and 45 minutes later (3.15) he is just west of the school (best buy). My theory is that he was on his way to the school to meet/surprise Stephanie (with the gift), as she was getting out of school at the same time as Hae (2.15-2.25). If Hae left school at 2.40 (after talking to her wrestling team friend and buying snacks), the two of them very likely crossed paths, as she would leave at the same time he arrived. In my opinion this is too much of a coincidence. Alternatively they happened to run into each other at Best Buy, as they were both buying CD's or whatever as gifts for Stephanie.	20141127T143358

dev1anter	53	0	So, in summary, the police knew exactly that Jay was lying EVERY TIME they talked to him, but thought that after 3-4 times they could've narrowed the story to fit it somewhat OK with the cell tower logs and put Adnan in prison. Also, NOTHING in jay's story indicates that Adnan was in fact with him and nothing about that can be corroborated. Also, they didn't even try to hide that Jay lied every single time. > (Brief of Appellant at 40) (“It was not contested [at trial] that [Jay] had lied in every pretrial statement he gave to the police.”).

Then at Patrick's house at 4:12. Then at his own house at 4:27 and 4:58. Any way you look at, it Jay is acting alone at this critical event. Jay had to have driven Hae's car to the I70 Park-and-Go himself. And had to have gotten a ride back to his house . (Perhaps the purpose of his next calls to Phil and Patrick from the I70 Park-and-Go.) So...come on. **The jig is up.** Why would the accomplice be doing this on his own? While Adnan was at track? And for anyone who might think, ""Well maybe Adnan just stayed at Woodlawn and didn't need to be dropped off at track."" Because there is a Woodlawn ping at 3:48. In this case, Adnan would still have his own car (because Jay's on the way to Park-and-Go). Yet Jay testified to picking Adnan up from Track and seeing Will.

For example, if a witness is asked to identify the make of a defendant’s getaway vehicle, and says, “Hyundai, Ford, Jeep, Tesla, Lamborghini,” then that witness’s testimony about seeing the car drive away from the crime scene cannot be said to have been “corroborated” if it later turns out that the car was, in fact, a Ford."""	20141127T074208

This is the very reason that appellate courts give great deference to the determination made by the fact finder.

I don't know whether there was a ""promised benefit instruction"" given separately or in some combined fashion, but here is what the general MD witness credibility instruction looks like: “You are the sole judges of whether a witness should be believed. In making this decision, you may apply your own common sense and everyday experiences. In determining whether a witness should be believed, you should carefully judge all of the testimony and evidence and the circumstances under which the witness testified. You should consider such factors as the witness' behavior on the stand and manner of testifying. Did the witness appear to be telling the truth? The witness' opportunities to see or hear the things about which testimony was given. The accuracy of the witness' memory. Does the witness have a motive not to tell the truth? Does the witness have an interest in the outcome of the case? Was the witness' testimony consistent? Was the witness' testimony supported or contradicted by evidence that you believe? And whether, and the extent to which the witness' testimony in the Court differed from the statement made by the witness on any previous occasion.

Adnans_cell	-2	0	Interesting that the article skips over the cell phone records that started the investigation into Adnan and is also the evidence that stitches the whole case against Adnan together. The reasoning for Jay to have motive to frame Adnan is really quite absurd. This all goes back to Jay somehow being a mastermind of alibis and cell tower records and everything he couldn't have known at the time he told Jenn to tell the police to talk to him. It's hindsight assembly of some of the facts of this case into a really sketchy hypothesis.	20141127T100624
Archipelagi	27	0	It's not as simple as the investigators knew he was lying, though. It's confirmation bias. Adnan was a former intimate partner with no solid alibi, so he gets a fairly high initial ranking as a person of interest. The other known former/current intimate partners of the victim end up having solid alibis, Adnan's ranking as a person of interest starts going up. Police get an anonymous phone call saying to look into Adnan, high priority alert on Adnan. They pull the phone records and see the phone was in Leakin Park on the night of the murder, RED ALERT RED ALERT WE MAY HAVE OUR MAN. They bring Jenn in to talk, she says she knows someone with Adnan that night, and he said Adnan told him he killed her, WE GOT 'EM, BOYS, SEW UP THE WITNESS STATEMENTS AND GO COLLAR HIM. So the cops go to talk to Jay. And at first, Jay makes things difficult, by telling some obvious lies about things that can't be true.

anonymous	2	0	"Agree. The issue at this point is, why did his lawyer miss all this? Or did she? You can see from the appellate papers that her main credibility attack on Jay was his plea deal, and it failed (as you can read in those papers). So according to what we've heard so far she was left trying to establish that the star witness was cheating on his girlfriend (""stepping out""). This was hopeless without independent evidence to confront him with. It is virtually impossible to make an alternative case through cross alone. To me the lawyer's performance matters because I'm starting to think she knew, or thought she knew, more about the Jay/Adnan relationship than we do. This was a smart person who could have shot fish in a barrel but did not. The lawyer could have used the evidence that the prosecution relied on to show Jay was not where he said he was at the time of the murder -- but apparently did not. She might have been concerned that Adnan knew that the 'Stephanie gift' was a lie; that Jay wasn't doing any such thing, but was where the cell record show he was (in Edmondson Village area) for a different reason that Adnan knew about. E.g, buying or selling drugs for or in league with Adnan. So I'm picturing Stephanie gift as a small lie -- to cover something like pot dealing Adnan didn't want his parents to know about -- unrelated to the murder that the lawyer didn't want to risk exposing."	20141127T130800

The very real problem we come back to with Adnan, as has been pointed out, is that he pretty much has no 'side' of the story, certainly not in the way Jay has. The very real problem with Jay's side of the story, is that he keeps changing it, keeps lying, and in the end it still doesn't make sense.	20141127T102319

Archipelagi	2	0	Yep, Jenn's timeline fit perfectly with what the cops were expecting. That's really decent evidence that the burial actually did occur sometime after 7pm and before 8pm. Jay's timeline is a little more shaky, but there's some consistency there as well.	20141127T053435

More importantly, Jay would have no way of knowing that when talking to the cops. Adnan claims his phone is with him when it was traced to Leakin Park. The last point is just specious logic. There is plenty of physical evidence of Adnan possibly being in contact with Hae. The issue is that it could be innocuous given you can't timestamp finger prints and DNA.	20141127T013934

He should be free.	20141127T002159
Hopper80	5	0	Would that this were my work! Same with Susan's comparing of various testimonies to the call log/tower pings from Adnan's phone. I take your point about Adnan, but I think it's very much worth going over Jay's testimony, which changed time and again.	20141127T000406
thewamp	2	0	That's not how the justice system works. If the state's case isn't credible, the defense should literally not need to say a single word to get a not guilty. If Adnan doesn't remember things, he should tell the truth and not make up a story.	20141127T053113
Hopper80	3	0	The only things that are consistent are the things for which no evidence can be found, which cannot be corroborated: Adnan killed Hae. Trunk pop. Burial. The changes happened for various reasons, including *after being shown the mobile records*.	20141127T102938

Hopper80	2	0	My position is that the state's case, on which Adnan was convicted, is bollocks. From that, I wonder why the state didn't construct a more believeable case, and from that think that they couldn't. Which is kind of damning. Further, that Jay rarely told the truth (he told the police time and again he was lying, ffs), and the sense that Adnan is hiding something - the repeated sense that there's stuff he's not saying that he could. Might be an admission of sorts, might be he's biting his tongue so as to not blurt out 'oh come on! Obviously Jay did it!'. This is from the position of having listened to the podcast, and read through various analysis. It's the response of a distanced, 'on paper', perspective. And yet, when I hear Guitterez going on at Jay, and imagine myself in that room, I immediately feel sympathy for anyone on the receiving end of that grating hectoring, and through that sympathy, and the kind of default 'Adnan's been charged. He must have done something' notion, Jay seems a lot more credible. When I hear that exchange, the words said don't really matter. It is how they are said that is dominant in how they affect me.	20141127T112558

brickbacon	1	0	That's not confirmation bias really, that's following leads and deductive reasoning. At best, you could say the bias comes into play when/if the massage Jay's testimony. They are not ignoring evidence along the way to confirm their biases. They are investigating. They didn't decide Don or Jenn didn't do it because they were fixated on Adnan. They followed the growing mountain of evidence leading to the killer, Adnan. And each time they looked into Adnan, his alibi, his friends, or his story, they see gaping holes, lies, and circumstantial evidence that ties him to the crime.	20141127T013336

goliath_franco	0	0	I mean it's detailed, but I'm not sure about thorough or even well reasoned. For example, I'm not that concerned that Jay gets his exact time and location wrong. How could you remember exactly where you were at 3:45pm on some day a couple weeks ago? The order of events and locations is far more important because that can more easily and accurately be recalled. Jay still changes on these points (locations change and so forth), but pointing out that Jay couldn't be where he says he was at 3:45pm doesn't demonstrate anything. The author of this blog post seems to think it's evidence that Jay is lying. This is just one example that leads me to believe that the author uses poor reasoning throughout that piece.	20141128T064559
Dr__Nick	2	0	It would be a lot more plausible if Adnan had said that rather than having to have other people provide that information for him.

brickbacon	2	0	"I would bet the state would have been able to convict Adnan without Jay's testimony. The reality is that most murders happen pretty much the way you would imagine, and that juries convict with shockingly little evidence. For example, Dateline just aired an episode about [David Dooley](http://abcnews.go.com/US/physical-evidence-janitor-trial-workers-slaying/story?id=25990885) who was convicted of killing a coworker. There was: 1. No physical evidence 2. No murder weapon 3. No smoking gun The sum total of evidence against him was: 1. He left the warehouse likely after his coworker was killed to go home, and came back later to discover the victim with a coworker. 2. Him and his wife told conflicting stories about why he came home 3. He was a ""shady"" guy 4. He refused a lie detector test That's pretty much it. The guy was convicted with FAR less evidence than we have on Adnan. I would not be surprised if Adnan would have been convicted even if Jay hadn't testified."	20141127T015123

brickbacon	-9	0	I wish we didn't have to go over this multiple times: 1. Adnan lied about not taking their breakup(s) poorly as evidenced by Hae's note 2. He lied about asking for a ride 3.

He likely lied about not wanting to accuse anyone given the motive for Jay he told his attorney. 6. He lied to his parents about dating, smoking weed, and basically living a seperate (if fairly normal) life.

That's Constitutional law, and as such, Adnan does not have ""testimony."" But what we do have from Adnan is generally consistent. (""I hung out with Jay... I probably went to the library... I probably went to track... I probably went to the mosque, etc""). Adnan's story doesn't change in response to detectives. Jay's does, ""We went to Mall A... We went to Mall B actually... I lied last time."" Jay's story changes every time. That much is apparent even with a casual listen to the podcasts.

The defense also never argued that the murder and burial did not happen that afternoon.

Vanulor	3	0	Just a small note, the appeal has nothing to do with proving or disproving Adnan's guilt. Appeals are usually only about procedural misconduct during the trial. His guilt is almost never ever retried in a court of law unless drastic evidence comes to light proving he didn't do it like DNA evidence. Normally the only thing on trial in a appeal is if something that should not have happened in the trail occurred. So the only time his guilt was ever tried was during his very first trial.	20141127T040114
PowerOfYes	3	0	Well, strictly speaking, the state only proved their case on the merits once, in front of those 12 jurors. None of the appeals are a re-hearing of the case.

Probably because they agree it did. >Adnan's story absolutely implicates himself, and all the more since he refuses to provide any details which could be scrutinized. How? He has a shoddy memory of his comings and goings on what was an otherwise unremarkable day until he learned (whilst high) that his ex-girlfriend was missing. And then later disappeared and was murder. Fasting, exercising, and smoking weed all day lead directly to poor bad memory. >The presumption of innocence does not require you to presume adnan is telling the truth about not remembering. I don't have to assume or conclude anything, as I wasn't on the jury. But since the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and since they tried to make their case by hanging it on Jay's testimony, it's the defense job to poke holes in that story. And thus, it's the jury's job to determine the reliability of that key witness and the believability of his story. Jay made multiple prior inconsistent statements. The defense impeached him for doing so. And yet his story was believed ""consistent"" with a general theme and timeline of cellphone towers. It's a weak case. It hinges on the testimony of liar - the only person known to have seen the dead body, and who later disposed of the evidence of the burial. Jay's character is suspect, as evidenced by the fact that even his friends say describe him to be a sketchy weirdo (I'm summarizing, not making a judgment against him for his manner of dress or taste in music), a mean or pushy ""alpha male,"" and one specifically said he was a full of shit bullshitter. Adnan's character was generally not suspect or confusing to people. In fact most say he was very kind and charming. His statements were generally consistent - that he wasn't around and didn't know anything. So, perhaps if Adnan did testify the jury would have had a chance to compare his style and character to the mess that is Jay."	20141128T023322

That said, the process for people like Adnan works almost all the time to ensure justice. Adnan wasn't some borderline retarded guy defended by some sleeping lawyer. Adnan's family spent tens of thousands of dollars on a seemingly competent lawyer, hired PIs, and found people like Rabia to highlight his case. Despite all that, he was convicted in near record time. No one seems to have found much reliable exculpatory evidence, reasonable alternative theories of the crime, or anything else in the 15 years since he was convicted. The system just generally doesn't break down for guys in his position. It has happened, but the vast, vast majority of the time, the outcome is as it should be. I think people here need to confront the fact that there is not likely to be some smoking gun that ties everything together here. The ""proof"" you are looking for does not exist because such ""proof"" almost never exists. The law doesn't even ask for undeniable evidence ""without any doubt"". The evidence here was pretty good by most professional accounts, and was good enough for all the people involved in the case who heard ALL the evidence firsthand. We heard 6 or so hours of podcast.

Because of their ability to set legal precedent in regions that cover millions of Americans, the United States Courts of Appeals have strong policy influence on U.S. law. Moreover, because the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) chooses to review less than 1% of the more than 10,000 cases filed with it annually, the United States Courts of Appeals serve as the final arbiter on most federal cases. >There are currently 179 judges on the United States Courts of Appeals authorized by Congress and [Article III of the U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution). These judges are nominated by the [President of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) and confirmed by the [United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate). They have lifetime tenure, earning an annual salary of $211,200. >There currently are thirteen United States courts of appeals, although there are other tribunals that have ""Court of Appeals"" in their titles, such as the [Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Armed_Forces), which hears appeals in [court-martial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial) cases, and the [United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_Veterans_Claims), which reviews final decisions by the Board of Veterans' Appeals in the [Department of Veterans Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs). The eleven numbered circuits and the [D.C. Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit) are geographically defined. The thirteenth court of appeals is the [United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit), which has nationwide jurisdiction over certain appeals based on their subject matter. All of the courts of appeals also hear appeals from some administrative agency decisions and rulemaking, with by far the largest share of these cases heard by the D.C. Circuit. The Federal Circuit hears appeals from specialized trial courts, primarily the [United States Court of International Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_International_Trade) and the [United States Court of Federal Claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Federal_Claims), as well as appeals from the district courts in [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent) cases and certain other specialized matters. >Decisions of the United States courts of appeals have been published by the private company [West Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_(publisher\)) in the *[Federal Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reporter)* series since the courts were established. Only decisions that the courts designate for publication are included. The ""unpublished"" opinions (of all but the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) are published separately in West's *[Federal Appendix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Appendix)*, and they are also available in on-line databases like [LexisNexis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis) or [Westlaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlaw). More recently, court decisions are also available electronically on the official court websites. However, there are also a few federal court decisions that are classified for national security reasons. >The circuit with the smallest number of appellate judges is the [First Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_First_Circuit), and the one with the largest number of appellate judges is the geographically-large and populous [Ninth Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit) in the Far West. The number of judges that the [U.S. Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) has authorized for each circuit is set forth by law in [28 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_28_of_the_United_States_Code) [§ 44](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/44.html), while the places where those judges must regularly sit to hear appeals are prescribed in [28 U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_28_of_the_United_States_Code) [§ 48](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/48.html). >Although the courts of appeals are frequently referred to as ""circuit courts"", they should not be confused with the former [United States circuit courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_circuit_court), which were active from 1789 to 1911, during the time when long-distance transportation was much less available, and which were primarily first-level federal [trial courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court) that moved periodically from place to place in ""circuits"" in order to serve the dispersed population in towns and the smaller cities that existed then. The current ""courts of appeal"" system was established in the [Judiciary Act of 1891](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1891), also known as the Evarts Act. >==== >[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/N9Wo01N.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Court_of_Appeals_and_District_Court_map.svg) - *Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts* --- ^Interesting: [^List ^of ^United ^States ^courts ^of ^appeals ^cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_courts_of_appeals_cases) ^| [^Biographical ^Directory ^of ^Federal ^Judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_Directory_of_Federal_Judges) ^| [^Chief ^judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_judge) ^| [^Federal ^Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reporter) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cme7749) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cme7749)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)"	20141127T040219
anonymous	15	0	From everywhere I see of you on this subreddit, you keep arguing for the sanctimony of the system we have in place. You're not arguing against any of the issues raised by this analysis, you refuse to even engage with it. Even if we accept that the judicial process in this country is nearly perfect (which it obviously isn't, made only too painfully clear just in the last couple of days) there can still exist outliers that test the limits of it. This analysis shows that Jay is not, by a legal standard (the blog's writer is herself a lawyer), a credible witness and was most assuredly coached through his entire trial performance by the prosecution and the police. On just the points raised in this article alone, we can come to those conclusions, why do we need to have sat through hours and hours and hours of tedium? Unless that tedium can somehow change the fact that Jay has lied and lied repeatedly throughout the ENTIRE process, then I don't see how that would be relevant to the discussion at hand.	20141127T030651
antiqua_lumina	1	0	> The system just generally doesn't break down for guys in his position. It has happened, but the vast, vast majority of the time, the outcome is as it should be. Couldn't agree more. I think that's why this story is so compelling. The system works 99% of the time, and I think it's at least 50/50 that Adnan is in the unfortunate 1%.	20141127T042544

shapshapboetie	2	0	I'm not missing that point at all. I just think it's legally insignificant. Why? Because he doesn't have to lay anything on the line. Miranda right to remain silent after arrest + 5th Amendment right not to self-incriminate. (essentially related) If Adnan is to be believed... he doesn't remember his day because how he spent the day was insignificant. And he apparently has a witness placing him elsewhere. Thus, his timeline is insignificant to the podcast because it provides no insight. >If person A tells a detailed story, with some facts that change or are proven false, and person B tells no story at all, person A is still more convincing than person B. I disagree, and it's the job of the attorney to suss out bullshit and the job of jurors to assess credibility. And Jay has none. Jay presents not 1 detailed story, but at least 4 story with many (not some) changing details and assertions (not facts). And all of them are self-serving in how he describes his role but shifts the major responsibility to Adnan - at a time he claims he was not present (but he's a known and admitted liar... so his claim is about being present at Hae's time of death cannot be believed). >Jay's testimony would have been weak had Adnan's team presented a counterfactual narrative, but they didn't because they couldn't. Well, they tried. But they tried to do so without Adnan's testimony or without the alibi witness from the library. Why? Lawyer tactics. Apparently shitty ones which are probably malpractice given that the lawyer did not contact the alibi witness (who may or may not have recanted after being approached by a PI or detective).	20141128T030000
anonymous	-3	0	For a guilty person on appeal? Yea I would want them to commit to something. Crazy I know.	20141127T032322
anonymous	-2	0	Amazing how he remembers the day so well till noon isn't it?	20141127T032417
anonymous	1	0	And I would argue that, this inaction is why he is in jail today. It's really hard for people to believe in someone who doesn't commit to where they were when a crime happened. This isn't a vacuum. Most women are killed by their partner or ex. So probability points towards him. Then there is the asking for a ride, the note, the not calling,and then no firm alibi? It's too much to buy for many of us. Sorry if it's a risk but he really has nothing (or everything) to lose.	20141127T044547
brickbacon	-2	0	"As evidenced by the above case (and plenty others I could list), you don't need a witness. That was my point. All this back and forth about Jay being a liar is missing the point. If Jay dropped dead the day before he was brought in for questioning, there is still a decent chance Adnan gets convicted. As far as your claim about bad investigations, I think the evidence speaks for itself. How many innocent people do you really think are in jail? It's vanishingly small. Especially in cases like this where someone has means and resources to defend themselves. Lastly, there is far more evidence against Adnan than just Jay's testimony. Here is just a short list: 1. The cell tower stuff 2. The call log 3. Hae's note 4. Adnan writing ""I'm going to kill"" on said note. 5. Hae's diary 6. Jenn's testimony 7. Adnan asking for a ride from Hae 8. Adnan lying about the ride from Hae 9. Adnan lying about his friendship with Jay 10. Adnan having no alibi 11. Cathy saying Adnan was acting weird, her comments about his behavior 12. Adnan's brother saying he was a masterful liar 13. Adnan's BF saying if he killed his GF he would dump her car in a lake 14. Adnan stealing from the Mosque 15. Adnan's car story having numerous holes 16. Adnan lying to his parents about all of his ""vices"" 17. Adnan's palm print on the map with the page torn out 18. Adnan calling Hae three times the night before she disappears 19. Adnan never paging her again or trying to get in touch 20. The Nisha call 21. Adnan lying about knowing where Leakin Park is 22. The anonymous tip pointing to Adnan All of those things don't PROVE he killed her, but likely all would be used against him if he ever got a retrial. That's without Jay even having to testify. I would bet the above alone would lead to his conviction (again)."	20141127T031132
thewamp	2	0	There's not actually any evidence that they did - but regardless no one's going to remember him six weeks later.	20141127T151305
dev1anter	2	0	well, if he was going to be found not guilty, it would most certainly be not because he's a nice guy, i can assure you that :)	20141127T110755

thewamp	4	0	"""No, Adnan killed Hae because he killed Hae"" - because that's not circular logic..."	20141127T055608
weedandboobs	2	0	K, I'll accept your premise as true even though the Innocence Project keep their success rates pretty close to the vest. If anything, your point proves that the evidence against Adnan is strong. The Innocence Project of Maryland turned Adnan down when his team previously applied. Twice. Of course, UVA's version did accept it, but I will be churlish enough to suggest that a This American Life reporter sniffing around was the main reason for their different standards.	20141127T034701
Archipelagi	1	0	"Small quibble: it doesn't say that Jay's testimony was coached, at least not in the intentional sense of the word. Like they discussed on the podcast, this was an ""above average"" investigation in terms of proving the state's case -- the relevant officials set out to prove what they believed to have actually happened. It's not uncommon for completely legitimate witnesses to sometimes sabotage you, and making sure a witness knows they can't just change their minds about their testimony, because they decide going to court would be too much of an inconvenience, or they don't want to help the cops, or what have you. Reluctant witnesses are real. The problem comes in when a witness's credibility gets determined by whether or not it fits the investigation's narrative. Not because anyone wants a witness to lie, but because there has been an erroneous assumption about what the ""real"" story is. That seems to be what happened in Adnan's case."	20141127T033730

You're not arguing against any of the issues raised by this analysis, you refuse to even engage with it. I don't think you know me well enough to state any of that. I actually think the system generally sucks. It fails in many places, but usually not the places we are talking about. More importantly, I don't see any evidence of it breaking down in this case. >Even if we accept that the judicial process in this country is nearly perfect (which it obviously isn't, made only too painfully clear just in the last couple of days) there can still exist outliers that test the limits of it.

He doesn't have to be a credible witness. This is the part I think people keep missing. The jury could throw out all of Jay or anyone else's testimony and still find Adnan guilty because at the end of the day, the rest of the circumstantial and character evidence we've seen indicates to me that there isn't a reasonable doubt that he did not kill Hae. We keep going in circles about how X thing Jay said was a lie so therefore Adnan is innocent when they are really largely orthogonal issues. >Unless that tedium can somehow change the fact that Jay has lied and lied repeatedly throughout the ENTIRE process, then I don't see how that would be relevant to the discussion at hand. I didn't need a blog post to point out Jay lied.	20141127T033705

As for the cell phone that pinged the Leakin Park tower i'll just repost what a person (a lawyer) expressed better than i would. >But there is absolutely no reason for Adnan’s cell phone to be calling Jenn if he and Jay are in Leakin Park together. Why is someone burying a body making social arrangements for later in the evening? That is careless, stupid, and bizarre behavior. But if you’re burying a body alone and have a two-car problem, repeatedly calling a friend makes a lot of sense."	20141127T154602
InvadersMustDie	1	0	The call taking place is one thing, but the thing is Nisha has no recollection of that call, and mixed up that call with another call later on in the month when Jay worked at the video store. All she remembered is talking to Adnan and then talking to Jay at one point. That to me is all that can be proven, the date time and location are all up in the air to me personally, her testimony holds no water. I say she sees the call logs, months later, sees that she was contacted at a time when Jay and Adnan were together, mixed it up with the time at the video store and thinks she remembers that day.	20141127T051946
Archipelagi	-1	0	It can't, though. Because (1) Jay's memory of the call can't be real (it didn't take place after the Patrick call and it didn't take place in Forest Park), and (2) Nisha's memory of the call can't be real (it didn't happen at the video store in the evening). We know a call was made from Adnan's phone to Nisha's home. But from Nisha's lack of memory of such of call, we have nothing to go on. It's an aberration in the data until at least one witness can give us something coherent to work with.	20141127T054054
Irkeley	1	0	No, not really. They just didn't include that question. I read it here. http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2ktyu7/nisha_call_evidence_in_episode_6_on_mistrials/	20141127T164832

anonymous	1	0	It happened to us a lot. Sometimes we would realize we have not received calls the whole day because the phone was not hung up properly.People even used to call neighbours and ask them to warn the other party to hung up the phone because they were trying to reach them.	20141127T084503
anonymous	1	0	It is not legally insignificant. The jury is not required to judge the prosecution's case in a vacuum. They are going to judge it in light of the case presented by the defense. A superficially weak prosecution case is going to be made stronger by an even weaker defense case. That is what happened here. >if Adnan is to be believed... he doesn't remember his day because how he spent the day was insignificant. Luckily the jury wasn't naive enough to believe such a ridiculous excuse. >And all of them are self-serving in how he describes his role but shifts the major responsibility to Adnan - at a time he claims he was not present (but he's a known and admitted liar... so his claim is about being present at Hae's time of death cannot be believed). I don't disagree with you here, but then jay wasn't on trial, Adnan was. The jury's job was to decide whether Adnan was guilty. If they're conclusion was that Jay and Adnan were coconspirators they're verdict for Adnan is still going to be guilty.	20141128T031136
anonymous	2	0	Oh I see what you're saying, my bad. I thought you meant at his initial trial itself. Well Adnan has made some probabilistic statements, things he may or may not have been doing given how ordinary the day was to him (as he describes it anyway). I don't think the fact that he doesn't come down hard on one version of events points heavily towards guilt, just because in the event he is genuinely innocent, then that's how we'd expect him to act anyway.	20141127T032927

They changed their respective stories to match, and Jay STILL couldn't get it right after 4 tries) . I'm done arguing with you. It's just pointless.	20141127T032030
thewamp	5	0	Evidence proves something. None of this does. It looks like you wrote down a long list and hoped that would be convincing So, let's look at this, because literally you do not have a single point here that corroborates Jay's story. This is not what they mean when they say evidence, this is just how you convinced yourself that your opinion must be right. To wit: 1. Call tower stuff - proves the phone was possibly in the greater Leakin Park area that night, assuming there wasn't a large amount of calls happening after work hours, in which case maybe that isn't true. 2. Call Log - This is the same as 1 in terms of what it actually proves. 3. Hae's Note - Proves that in the days immediately after a breakup, Adnan was upset. Based on the car-changing-with-don, he got over it pretty fast. 4. Kill Note - No proof this was Adnan and even less proof that Adnan chose to admit to his crime in class by writing on a note that was being passed around. Almost certainly not a real threat. 5. Hae's Diary. Proves not much of anything? She dated Adnan. 6. Jenn's Testimony - proves Jay told her Adnan did it. 7. Asking for a Ride - proves nothing. He needed a ride. 8. Lying About Ride - explained by his dad being in the room 9. Lying About Jay - he didn't. This is corroborated by basically everyone - Jay, Jenn, people at school, etc. They weren't the closest. They smoked weed. 10. No Alibi - proves that he cannot prove he did not do it. Not evidence, just not counter-evidence. 11. Cathy Statements - proves nothing, easily explained by his high behavior and either a) having to go to prayers at mosque for ramadan or b) having to talk to a police officer. 13. Lying Claim - Evidence of character, not evidence of killing. 14. Stealing from mosque - Evidence of character, not evidence of killing. 15. Car Story Holes - no. There are none. This is solid. 16. Vices - more character, not evidence. 17. Palm Print - proves that Adnan has been in Hae's car before. 18. Adnan calls Hae - proves Adnan tried to call her. The three times was their system of talking and getting around parents. Not evidence of murder. 19. Not Paging - explained by him going through what's-her-name. In any case, does not prove anything. 20. Nisha Call - Butt dial, not evidence. 21. Leakin Park lie - no proof he lied. Having been there to have sex with Hae does not mean he knew the name of the wooded place he drove by. 22. Anonymous tip - could be jay, definitely not credible	20141127T054551

That said, Adnan was actually incorrect in his initial application, as we now know, there is DNA testing of various samples taken at and around the burial site as well as Hae's body that could potentially exonerate him or at the very least provide leads to other credible suspects (or, it should be said, prove his guilt).

shapshapboetie	2	0	In general we agree here, but I don't think we're able to judge how weak the defense's case was. Not from the podcast alone. Jay's credibility is impeached pretty heavily, and yet one jury member believed him as the kind of guy who helped people clean up their messes. As if that's a redeeming thing. Adnan had a flimsy but plausible explanation of his whereabouts, but it was not corroborated or explained with much detail on the podcast. Not sure about the trial itself. The absence of the library witness was boneheaded. Jay wasn't on trial for murder, but in cross-examination his veracity is on trial. And he fails that with flying colors. Except the juror believed him. I think the strongest case against Adnan actually is as a co-conspirator. But if Jay is the unindicted co-conspirator, rather than an accessory after the fact, then he is the lying liar we know him to be... and the detectives and prosecutors are apparently content with that.	20141128T033018

jvtb86	1	0	I agree. No clue how anyone thinks they could have gotten Adnan without Jay's cooperation. Cell phone pings in the park area where they found Hae? Even that's pretty worthless if there is no witness to when she was actually buried there - the 13th, 14th, 15th, 20th. Adnan would have the right to go to the general proximity of the park on a random night and later forget why he'd gone there.	20141127T035206

Up until then, it was a normal and totally forgettable day. I assume that it was kind of the same for Adnan. And the call wasn't ""Your ex-girlfriend is murdered"" - it was ""Have you seen Hae?"" Sure, a call from a cop can be stressful - but it's not earth-shattering."	20141127T050109
davegoodmen	2	0	It was mention in the podcast that when the police called him, he didn't believe Hae was murder. Adnan thought that she was probably off to somewhere with Don and she didn't tell her parent. Also, memory is a tricky thing especially if no one is there to confirm it. His friend probably did ask where he was on that day, and he probably mentions something along the line taht he was in the library before practice. His friends aren't going to interrogate him for more evident.	20141127T005140
anonymous	2	0	>In the days after the murder, I'm sure Adnan and friends must have discussed what they were doing, their whereabouts, etc Why are you sure of this? In the days after Hae went missing, they didn't all see one another. She was taken on a Wednesday, and the next time they would have been together was the next Tuesday. By that time it might have started to be a bigger question, but the testimony from her friends was that they really thought she'd gone back to CA, where she spent half of her sophomore year & which she'd talked about going back to. They wouldn't have been sitting around going over *their own* movements on the day they last saw her.	20141127T070637
happydee	2	0	there is NOT a 6 weeks gap in interaction with the police from Episode #1 That first day, the police call around to her friends, they talk to Aisha, to Adnan, remember that’s when he tells them he was supposed to get a ride from her, but didn’t. The next day they call around to hospitals, hotels, motels, they check the area around the high school parking lot where she was last seen. You can see from their reports that they immediately hone in on the most time warn explanation for such disappearances: the boyfriends, current and former. That first day they call Don, her new guy. They check the area around his house which is in another county, northeast of Baltimore. Over the next two weeks they keep going back to Don, and to Adnan, asking more questions.	20141127T070805
namefree25	6	0	"Adnan (not Adman), if innocent, would have had no idea Hae had been murdered that day. All he knew was that Hae hadn't picked up her cousin, and so she would be in trouble with her mother. Her body wasn't found until weeks later. Not unusual for family to call friends to track down a teen--I remember answering such calls as a teen (""No, Susie is not at my house"") and as a parent, I have made a couple of those calls. Those are not signs that someone has been murdered. What is horrifying is that it did turn out that Hae was murdered: a possibility few, if any, entertained on Jan 13. Thus, Adnan, if innocent, would have had no reason to remember anything specific about that day if it were like every other day in every other respect. Furthermore, memory is not a videotape: we don't capture footage and keep it, intact and retrievable at will. I have had experiences in which I have been sure something happened on one date and have come across information that contradicts my vivid memory. Memory is so much more malleable than we like to think. The Innocence Project leader Deirdre notes that the innocent ones usually don't have alibis because they honestly can't remember where they were that day (among all other days). To make an alibi claim, an innocent defendant would have to lie--Adnan's vagueness, then, instead of being suspicious, may simply reflect the ordinariness of his actual day."	20141127T014617
lalaverne	2	0	OR, Adnan is displaying retrograde- and/or anterograde-amnesia in response to traumatizing information. It's not uncommon for the organization of the brain to short-circuit upon learning about something horrifying, e.g., the murder of an ex or a good friend. An overly-specific recollection of a traumatic experience would actually be more suspicious.	20141127T034836
salvatoresingh	1	0	"""...shouldn't the day of the murder stick out in his mind more..."" It should only if: A. he were innocent but Hae's body had been found that same day. That would have made that day legitemately significant. Thats my understanding of how memory works. It doesnt strengthen retroactively. Which is what we are expecting when we say that after Feb 9th Adnans mind should naturally have brought Jan 13 into focus. The brain brings things into focus and strenthens memory at the time of the major event not later. And its debatable whether the events of Jan 13 were a 9/11 like event for Adnan, (which is what it would be like if his ex's murdered body had been discovered that day). B. He were guilty. In which case he would certainly remember everything and is pretending not to."	20141129T172650
etcetera999	1	0	Yup - it's really hard to believe that he blanked about that day when the police specifically asked him about it - that evening and the next day, I believe. The process of answering the police should have crystallized his memory of that afternoon. Police: Hae was reported missing earlier today. When's the last time you saw her? Adnan: Hmm, let me think. I saw her at school. After school today, did I see her? Well, I can't remember what happened to me this past afternoon.	20141127T014148
Angusstewart14	3	0	Thats a different scenario though, I'm assuming there was no mystery behind your mothers passing (sorry for your loss) so you had no reason to question or reflect on what had happened previously throughout the day... if, while in high school, you got a call from the police saying your ex girlfriend is missing and asking if you have seen her. You would INSTANTLY scan through the day and maybe even previous ones before thinking of all the times you saw or heard anything about her... And if as it turned out for Adnan you never saw the girl again, I STRONGLY believe those memories would stay in your head forever.	20141127T065854

That's why it's so hard for us to imagine Adnan not remembering stuff. Wha? What do you mean you ""can't remember?"" But when you try to remember the details from Thursday 6 weeks ago, how well do you do? Man, when I was smoking a lot of weed, my memory was utterly, utterly unreliable. I can imagine that those events you describe would not be enough to force clarity into a pot addled mind. Importantly, the burden of proof isn't on Adnan to prove his innocence - it's on the State to prove his guilt. A defense of ""I don't remember"" shouldn't result in a conviction. It doesn't prove guilt, it might just be honest forgetfulness. :)"	20141127T102724
Woodsaw	2	0	This is an important point. The podcast also makes it seem like he was getting high almost every day around that time of his life. That given, I don't think it's unreasonable at all for him to have a not-so-stellar memory of those events.	20141127T054513

antiqua_lumina	12	0	Interesting. If the cops knew where the car was before Jay took them there, then it raises the possibility that the cops either intentionally or unintentionally told Jay the car's location. The cops and/or Jay could have used this information to shore up the testimony. And a few days ago someone said that at the second trial Jay said that he didn't take the cops to the car, and then the prosecutor corrected him and Jay said he did take them to the car.	20141127T043521

mdudu	5	0	So this is telling us that the cops knew where the car was shortly after finding her body. But I remember SK saying in one of the first episodes something like, 'the only thing that the detectives didn't know was where Hae's car was'.

Anttgod	4	0	Could the reporter be inaccurate in the report?	20141127T055953
imperatorhadrianus	4	0	"It's shocking to me that people downplay this detail so much. This is precious contemporary information of the case from before the many reworkings in the interrogation room and at trial. I think it pretty clearly shows that the police knew where the car was before Jay showed it to them. The final episode concluded with SK saying that the one thing we know is that Jay ""knew where the car was."" I don't think we even know that. The police could very easily have inadvertently suggested to Jay where the car was. Remember that [in the appellate brief Jay initially brings the cops to the wrong location](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2myl3q/did_jay_actually_know_where_haes_car_was/). It takes until the third interview before Jay manages to successfully show them the correct location. So I think we're left with absolutely nothing substantive linking Jay and Adnan to Hae's death. I think we have prosecutors seeking a conviction at all costs, probably believing themselves they know who the killer is, and we have them telling a scared kid to implicate his friend or go to jail himself. I have no idea who did it. Maybe it was Jay or Adnan, but I think it's more likely it's a third party -- maybe one of the serial killers, or maybe another 3rd party who has gone completely unnamed. All in all this case has been completely bungled, and it gives me no confidence at all in the legal system in the US today."	20141221T211636

goliath_franco	3	0	Was this video hard to find? It seems like a cool tidbit. If you look at Serial's [timeline of events](http://serialpodcast.org/maps/who-what-when), Jay showed the cops where Hae's car was on the same day (actually around 3am) that they arrest Adnan (Feb 28). This video is dated Feb 28, which lines up exactly with Serial's timeline: Jay shows the cops where Hae's car is, the cops arrest Adnan for the murder, and finally, the cops tell the media they've arrested Adnan for the murder (all on Feb 28). In the news report, it's a little unclear what they're referring to as the key withheld details. Is it that she was strangled? Buried in a shallow grave? Buried in Leakin Park? That her car was nearby? I agree that the way they narrate it makes it sound like the location of Hae's car was another piece of information that the police withheld, but even if that *is* what the news meant to convey, the police did withhold that information until after they arrested Adnan later that day. It's kind of weak, but maybe that's just how it came out in the report because of imprecise communication from police to the media or from the media to us viewers.	20141127T091605
partymuffell	3	0	"First of all, I wouldn't put too much weight in the wording of a local news report. SK and the Serial team looked into all of the police and court documents and would have certainly noticed any discrepancy in the story of how Hae's car was found. Second, the police rarely discloses all of the details of ongoing investigations. The ""key details"" they had withheld that the news report is referring to were, likely, the strangulation and the exact location of the burial site. Third, I find it extremely hard to believe that Mr S accidentally stumbled into the burial site, so your analogy is worthless to me."	20141127T143316
anonymous	1	0	What's the date on this news story? Was it before the NB incident?	20141127T082107
ShrimpChimp	1	0	Or maybe the cops didn't want anyone talking to Jay so they withheld that detail. Maybe a reporter and a producer had an issue with the details and played it safe. Maybe this news story was like a lot of breaking news and was misleading or mistaken.	20141128T061305
Cabin11	0	0	"No, in Episode 3, ""Leakin Park"". The trial testimony. Sarah Koenig: Justin and I weren’t the only ones who had this reaction. The city surveyor, a guy named Philip Buddemayer went out to the burial site to measure the distance from the road. This is before they disintered her. Here’s Buddemayer testifying at trial. Philip Buddemeyer: When I arrived at the site where the body was, there was a log on the ground approximately forty feet long. I stepped over the log, I walked along the edge of the log expecting to find the body real soon. I never saw one, at which time had I taken one more step I would have walked on the gravesite where the body was. Female Court Official: And at that point there were others on the scene? Philip Buddemeyer: Yes ma’am. There was a lot of people there. Female Court Official: And at some point did someone point out to you the exact location-- Philip Buddemeyer: Yes ma’am. The detective pointed out the site. I looked down at the ground, and I said “I don’t see any body.” It wasn’t freshly disturbed. Female Court Official: It was not freshly disturbed. Philip Buddemeyer: No. Yeah it just blended in with the natural surroundings of the ground. Sarah Koenig: So here’s a guy who’s looking for the body, who knows where it’s supposed to be, who can see there’s a bunch of people standing around it, and still he can’t find it. So does it seem reasonable that Mr. S who apparently wasn’t looking for anything besides as secluded place to pee, discovered it? Just like that?"	20141127T022735

Cabin11	2	0	"Right, but this report can't have happened that much later than Adnan's arrest, right? Which, according to what I've read, happens only hours after Jay's testimony on February 27th. It's just that the rampant bad bookkeeping and allegations of misconduct make me consider why ""the trip to find the car"" happens at midnight with - as far as we know - no other witnesses other than the detectives and Jay."	20141127T030935
Cabin11	5	0	yes.	20141127T060014
Cabin11	1	0	Yes! And I've heard people understandably argue that the cops wouldn't tell the press that they just found her car the night before thanks to a testimony of an accomplice because that is - naturally - sensitive information. This has to be considered too, if I'm being fair. But whether they did sit on the car, or the press reported this way out of ignorance, this and Jay's fluctuating testimonies about the car are at least 2 reasons I actually started wondering if we can truly believe whether the midnight trip with Jay to find the car happened at all.	20141221T214538
Cabin11	1	0	Right on, I take your point on Sarah's research, as long as these records were kept faithfully. But I don't think Mr. S. stumbled onto the grave site either, which is why I made that analogy: how are we to believe Mr. S. could find this needle in a haystack, but they couldn't find a car on Franklintown and Edmonson, or wherever it is alleged to have been found? That's why I contrasted those notions.	20141127T155536

Cabin11	8	0	What I'm getting at is this: The detectives had to point it out to this guy on whose expertise they clearly relied in matters of surveying the earth.

bblazina	6	0	I'm not trying to contest your point. I also think it is very strange and posted a similar text link a while back. Something along the lines of how could this car go unfound for 45+ days? And it seems very strange that Mr. A just stumbles upon the body. Seems more likely that he had heard it was there and went looking for it.	20141127T025529

miazia	3	0	I had a similar question-how could Mr. S. have been convinced that what we saw was a body if he (or anyone else) could not really tell that there was a body? I guess what I am saying is, if I thought that I noticed a body buried, I would almost certainly grab a stick or something to clear away enough debris to see it. It sounded like the burial site was completely undisturbed. Is that strange. Maybe it just wasn't disturbed enough for others to notice?	20141128T061142
AtladyTinyhulk	3	0	I think Mr. S found the body because he was getting undressed for streaking or dressed after and he saw Hae's hair because he was picking up or putting down his clothes.	20141127T130852
bblazina	6	0	I am so confused about this part. The podcast says Jay took them to the car on the early morning of 02/28 (a few hours before they arrested A). The appeals doc seems to indicate he took them to the car in April. So which is it?	20141127T041146

But the chances are not equal; some explanations are more likely than others. It is said that the simplest answer is usually the most likely. All that is my way of saying you might be right, but the easiest explanation is that Jay had a bad memory and lots of time had passed and it was at night so he forgot where the car was.	20141127T043622

bblazina	4	0	It was like they pulled a form for polygraph tests and didn't adapt it to make it relevant to this case at all. Or maybe they had better leads at this point that they wanted to follow so they made the questions as bland as possible. Seriously, how could even a single one of those questions show them that he didn't stumble upon the body by accident?!

anonymous	1	0	Don't think it works like that. If he tells his story, but has no proof, I'd guess they'd have to actually investigate -- you know interview people and collect evidence and try to determine whether there was any truth to his story.

rojarojita	8	0	I think the overall conclusion is reasonable, but it's not really correct to frame it as lying in the middle of two competing stories. Adnan's story is that he didn't murder Hae. The truth (as you've speculated) is that he did murder Hae. Those alternatives lie on entirely different poles. It is fascinating to ponder why Adnan postures the way he does, if he is indeed guilty. I think SK has done a great job of showing us how important it is to Adnan that he be viewed as a person incabable of murder. The psychological machinations behind this are less clear.	20141127T051450

He seems to be using his parents as agents of his own feelings."	20141127T060828
mistajee33	12	0	Another point I wanted to make, somewhat influenced by the many hours I've logged watching The Wire and reading David Simon's books (I know, doesn't make me an expert by any means, but as brought up in another thread, is really insightful for anyone interested in homicide investigation, coincidentally also set in Baltimore). The detectives KNOW Jay is lying. They know his story isn't consistent. But they also KNOW that Adnan did it; they're professionals, have dealt with killers their entire careers, and they've done their due diligence. Not every aspect of their investigation is on tape or on paper for us to see, and that may be entirely strategic. In these situations, sometimes you're forced to build the case that's going to have justice served as best it can, even if that means it isn't always the full truth.	20141127T045354
andrewcortex	3	0	This is the best 'anti-Adnan' post I have seen and should always be kept in mind when going down the rabbit hole of alternate theories: Adnan (or Jay for that matter) does not have to be a manipulative psychopath to have commited the murder. We are presented with such little information from a decade and a half ago and no less than half of it is garaunteed to be a complete fabrication. It's fine to have a belief one way or the other, but don't fool yourself into thinking you know anything for sure.	20141128T054300

serialisgreat	3	0	"This is an interesting idea. What you are basically saying is that Jay is a liar who gave false testimony but you still believe Adnan is guilty. However, if we are going to stipulate that Jay's testimony cannot be credited but allege that Adnan is nonetheless guilty, then I think the burden of proof should be on the person alleging Adnan's guilt to explain why he or she is convinced of his guilt. Because without Jay, the case against Adnan is a lot less obvious. Based on your post, the reasons that you nonetheless think Adnan is guilty are that he called Jay ""pathetic"" in court, and he responded in a particular way to questions about his character and his parents' state of mind. These are not sufficient to convince me that Adnan is guilty and I imagine that they would not be sufficient for most people. Do you have any other reasons for believing that Adnan did this, such as a different interpretation of the cell phone records?"	20141127T083208
FckReddit1	2	0	Good theory but I think you are reading too much into the semantics of what bothers adnan about what people think. For instance, he said he was really pissed when his defense lawyer argued that it was a heat of the moment killing.

SK actually teased this in the first episode ""what if he did do it - and he has all these good people believing in him"".

Detectives may indeed be trained to detect liars. Some are probably pretty good at it. But someone's own sense of how good they are at detecting liars isn't a good indication of how good they are at it. [This](http://www.angelfire.com/lieclass/II.pdf) is good reading on the topic. The introduction has a lot of background information, and the study itself shows that training that was common at the time (the article is from 1999) actually made people *worse* at detecting lies.

lockea	5	0	Actually don't Bunk and McNulty do pretty much the same thing in the Wire? (spoilers for s1) In season 1 they ultimately get Omar to testify about the murder of the witness which happens at the start, and Omar fingers the Barksdale soldier. However Omar didn't actually witness the murder, and the detectives KNOW he didn't, but they also know that the accused definitely did it - it was common knowledge but no better witnesses came forward. So they coach Omar a bit and overlook the inconsistencies in his story Also I remember a scene later on where Bunk is taking a witness statement for a murder where he pretty much knows who is guilty, and the witness can't pick out the right face from the lineup, so Bunk subtly points to the right one >In these situations, sometimes you're forced to build the case that's going to have justice served as best it can, even if that means it isn't always the full truth. Yes, it's an interesting moral question as to what is the right and just thing to do - if they had gone after Jay properly for his role in it all, they might have lost his testimony and let Adnan - the murderer - walk free. I suppose the problem comes when the police think they KNOW definitely who the real killer is, but get it wrong, and then they manipulate evidence and wilfully overlook things that put the wrong guy away	20141127T200743

This isn’t like, you know, yell at the bank teller for-- yell at the waiter for getting the order wrong or something like that, because it’s not like they’re saying it was a crime of passion. They’re saying this was a plotted out-- Sarah Koenig: No, I know. (Adnan and Sarah speaking on top of each other) Adnan Syed: It insults me to my core, man, you know what I mean? It used to. Not-- I don’t care now. You know what I’m saying-- Sarah Koenig: So you don’t believe-- you’re not someone who believes that like everyone could in a-- like anyone could kill depending on the circumstances, like if they were-- Adnan Syed: No, yeah like if your life was threatened! You know what I’m saying? Like if it was me or him. Or like if my kids are in danger. I don’t-- no, I completely don’t think that anyone or even the majority of people, you know, could stoop to, you know what I’m saying, to doing something like this. Based on what? What did she ever do to me that would cause me to feel so angry at her. Everyone-	20141127T173100

thewindowview	9	0	"Hi, I am a lawyer who works for a state appellate court judgee. Sarah getting to investigate this story and tell it is like my job except (1) I don't get to talk to anyone outside of my judge about our cases, and (2) our job is to decide if there is a valid reason to reverse a conviction, not the Ultimate Truth. Also, we are confined to the trial court record. I guess that as a matter of likelihoods I am cynical and lean toward the ""Adnan did it"" camp. Because he is the rejected ex and she was strangled. And because he doesn't remember the day when she went missing, and didn't call her after she went missing. I tend to be dubious of all the pop psych stuff, so and so is nice or mean or trustworthy or not, because very nice seeming people can do horrible things and very horrible seeming people can be innocent. That is all irrelevant to me. What matters are facts. Hae was strangled to death. Jay somehow knew where her car was. She had recently rejected Adnan and he cannot account for his whereabouts at her time of death. I don't particularly trust cops, and I could easily believe Jay was fed info, but my question is, why?? In fact, if they were just trying to pin it on somebody, why wouldn't they want to pin it on the kid who already had the record? Plus I think that if it were Jay in prison, same facts but flipped stories, the evidence against Jay would look shaky too. All these redditors would be poking holes in the case against Jay and mayne fingering Adnan. So. I am dubious of people who are so sure Adnan is innocent and Jay is guilty. Maybe that's true, but it seems at least as doubtful as the case against Adnan. None of which means I am convinced Adnan is guilty. The fact that a jury believed Jay after his story changed so many times is hard to comprehend. I wish I had the whole trial record in front of me like I would at work. I also suspect that Jay's drug dealing was more important than the podcast has made clear yet. At the least it could be how the cops got cooperation from Jenn and Jay. So. That's me!"	20141128T224945
edinburghkyle	6	0	Just saying hi from Scotland UK! I heard about Serial last weekend and ended up binge-listening to the whole thing this week. Then I went online and stumbled across this sub and have been enjoying reading the discussions and the associated links etc. I really can't believe that there's a community of amateur (and not-so-amateur) investigators out there working on things - has there ever been a case like this with so much public involvement? (I've not felt moved to debate something from TV/Radio online since I was trying to figure out what was going on in LOST; I feel that this case is less confusing actually.) It's an exciting new concept that Serial has, perhaps inadvertently, created. I'm trying not to read too much though - I don't really want to find out new information before SK features it on her show! I think that, going forward, Serial might be wise to harness and make use of some of the great work that people are putting in online. It's perhaps too late for season 1, but in the future there really could be a role. My thoughts would be an official discussion board on their site, (or an official presence on this sub) with specific questions that they would ask in order to engage public debate. Or maybe even just some official polls each week so they can gauge listener sentiment and include it in the next weeks' show. I'd love to see a sister-show as well (maybe a couple of times per season), where they have a panel (such as the [e.g.] cell tower experts, ex-cops, lawyers, avid listeners etc.) debate the case in some more detail. My thoughts at this point are that the cops just wanted a story, any story. (I've watched enough of the Wire to know that homocide cops are under pressure in places like Baltimore re: clearance rates. [The Wire is like real life, right?! Don't ruin this for me.]) I believe they found Jay's story and helped him paper over the cracks in order to just about make it water tight. At this point, I feel for Adnan, I really do - it must be sickening to have to stand in court, never mind spend the best part of your life in prison, and be told that you murdered someone when you know that you didn't but are helpless to prove otherwise. I'm not saying I've 100% decided that he's innocent (I will of course wait until the end of the series to make up my mind - there are some fishy details about him and who knows what will emerge in the remaining episodes), but I certainly don't believe that there was enough evidence to convict. I've enjoyed reading the articles on viewfromll2.com and whilst they make a good case for pinning things on Jay, I simply can't find a motive anywhere for Jay to do it. Apart, of course, from the fact that Adnan got his girlfriend a reindeer toy and he couldn't think of a better gift. I had a thought today that perhaps some of you could answer, but didn't want to put up an entirely new post in case it was a dumb question. Let's say the innocence project, or some other lawyer decides to try and take this to court to get Adnan's conviction overturned. Won't there be real problems in finding a jury without prior (detailed?) knowledge of the case that could bias their judgements, now that so many people are tuning in and the story has been on the news so much? My knowledge of law isn't so good, US law even less so, so apologies if this is a dumb question and there wouldn't even be a jury at such a hearing... Can't wait for the next episodes!	20141130T093943
cat_morgue	6	0	My main interest in Serial definitely lies in the fact that it takes place in Baltimore, which is where I live. Being able to visualize the locations where events took place because I've seen them first hand has really helped me become submerged in the story. I'm familiar with Security Square Mall, I've been to Patapsco, I know the stories about Leakin Park. It obviously hits close to home, since it is home (though I don't live particularly near Woodlawn).	20141127T134019
Muzorra	5	0	"I guess I'd better say something now that I haven't been able to keep my trap shut in other threads. I was/am a TAL listener and came over right away. I was a little worried about how well it would do, TAL stuff seeming to have a bit of a niche audience. But it was right up my alley. I'm nuts for The Thin Blue Line, Paradise Lost, The Staircase, that kind of thing. So great. I had no idea anyone else in the world was paying attention until about week 5 when I googled the show just to download it. I get all these news links ""Sensation"" ""Biggest podcast in the world, possibly ever"" etc etc. Ok, I guess it's not just me! ANother thing happened that surprised me. I'm not always a 'detective'. I've often thought I wouldn't mind trying being one, but I'm not sure how good I'd be. I know people who really pick up on all the details in TV shows and so forth and really try to theorise and dissect all the angles all the time. I'm more casual, usually, unless I try really hard. I was with Serial too up until a certain point a couple of weeks ago. I noticed some detail and I was cross referencing it with stuff from the very beginning without any prompting, sometimes right before SK herself would point out some connection or contradiction in the show. So I'm doing this detail analysis and everything without even meaning to initially. No stored up old eps (at the time), no monday morning quarterbacking from other podcasts, blogs, youtube. Just by myself. I knew already on one level, but that confirmed it. This is a very well done show indeed. Anyway, with this little break I kinda had to come see just how much everyone else had been doing. I'm from Australia btw. Hello!"	20141128T210700
Tanz1	10	0	Hey y'all, I've just discovered reddit in the last week and I'm just about as addicted to it as the podcast. I'm leaning towards thinking Adnan is guilty but I'm undecided. However as mentioned a lot here I agree it's clear that the case was totally botched. I don't really have anything new to add in terms of theories or speculation, but I would like to know more about Don (even just clarifying why his alibi is so iron clad? Because he was at work? Couldn't he have taken a break or slipped out for some time?)	20141127T030033

Harvelicious	4	0	"Truth! And rashomon! My obsession with Serial is most likely related to my perhaps unhealthy obsession with truth. I suspect many of you out there are in the same boat. I often can't let uncertain things go, as with this podcast, to the extend that it becomes borderline annoying to myself and certainly others as I continue to scratch and dig looking for verification of events etc. what you will quickly discover if you, like me become obsessed with truth, and I suggest you don't , is that truth can be subjective and that if someone's perspective or recollection of events doesn't adhere to yours or the establishments it does not mean they are 'lying'. If you haven't I would strongly suggest watching Kurosawa's masterpiece ""Rashomon"" which deals with the subjectivity of truth. For the record I swing back and forth and am currently on team jay but barely. I can absolutely understand why his testimony is shifty and think this sounds like a man TERRIFIED on all fronts. I actually have nightmares about it. Thanks serial! Oh, and I've come to terms (I think) with the fact that we, or I rather, will almost certainly never know the truth."	20141129T004253

It's a wonderful piece of podcasting. I'm surprised by how far down the rabbit hole people are prepared to go...and how definite people are on both sides of the discussion! I haven't commented too often yet, but if there are any insights into Korean families I can offer, if be happy too!

Not super experienced, never handled a murder, but I have previously worked for the innocence project. I really like that Serial is making the complexities of criminal defense, and how a person cannot really just be reduced to the label of ""criminal"" (its never that simple!) accessible to millions. If people leave this podcast with some empathy for those accused or convicted of crimes, then I will consider it a huge success!"	20141130T162007
anonymous	9	0	"I started coming here every time I had a question, or needed my personal theories validated, and finally decided I had to get a log-in today. I think Jay has dealt with his guilt/thoughts/feelings about the murder by transferring, in his own head, all of his actions onto Adnan from the time the act was committed. The first example of this would be him recounting Adnan supposedly recounting the murder at Patapsco Valley State Park, but I think this is most evident 15 years later when he tells SK something to the effect of, ""I can't believe he hasn't just manned up and admitted it."" That sounded to me like something he would think about himself, if guilty, instead of something you would say to someone you testified against and who was already convicted and in prison. I also remember very vividly how getting in trouble/staying out of trouble with my parents consumed me in high school. I can think of two times Adnan's behavior were called into question where I would have reacted exactly the same: first when he found out Hae was missing and the police were looking for her, and second where he did not page Hae after she had gone missing. As a teenager, I would have first thought about the trouble (not about them being in any potential danger) an ex-boyfriend would be in if I had received a call and found out they had gone missing and the police were looking for him. Regarding the page, if I had a friend that went missing, I would have never paged or called them, as I would be concerned that if they had run away my call/page would be evidence of collusion (thus getting me in trouble with my parents eventually) or if something terrible had happened, I would be worried about future questions about why I had tried to page/call them, i.e., did I know she or he was in danger, did I know anything, etc.? I would have kept my distance with the knowledge that their parents and the police were handling things. I am very excited to be here, like everyone else I need an outlet to get me to December 4th."	20141128T195812

My friend Jeff, who's a reporter for the Iowa City Press-Citizen and Des Moines Register and I decided to put together a podcast where we talked about the different ways that stories are being told in Serial. I'd love to know what folks here think of what we think and of course I can't wait to be more of a presence here.

wh8888	4	0	Howdy. I've been lurking since about Ep3. I think none of us know if Adnan is actually guilty, but I think there's more than reasonable doubt. But even if he did do it - he has been in jail for about 15 years - in most Countries (including my own, Scotland), he'd probably be eligible for parole about now unless he obviously posed a risk to others. Nothing about what we've heard suggests he's a danger. Plus a sentence of Life + 30 is ludicrous - can anyone explain to an non-US person what the + 30 is supposed to achieve?	20141128T222002
anonymous	4	0	"Hi there, new Redditor and poster here. I have been listening to the Serial podcast from the beginning, but I just started lurking here recently. There's been some interesting discussion, and it's one of the reasons I decided to finally sign up for a Reddit account. Generally I tend to be a person that likes to soak in a lot of information before I make a comment or judgement, so that lends itself to lurking more overall. I have to say I found the two posts at ""The View From LL2"" blog, linked on this subreddit, to be the most compelling narratives I've seen that deviate from the official theory as presented by the prosecution. [Link 1 (*cell records vs witness statements*)](http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/23/serial-a-comparison-of-adnans-cell-phone-records-and-the-witness-statements-provided-by-adnan-jay-jenn-and-cathy/), and [Link 2 (*Jay's testimony*)](http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/26/serial-why-jays-testimony-is-not-credible-evidence-of-adnans-guilt/) To me the sheer volume of lies from Jay is extremely suspicious, and they are laid out in pretty exhaustive detail in those blog posts. That being said, the author still did make some assumptions. And the fact that a call can sometimes be routed through an adjacent cell tower was mainly used to benefit the alternate theory, but never in a way that would be detrimental to Adnan's case. However I think the author was very clear about the assumptions she was making so I was fine with it in terms of presenting an alternate theory of the case. Either way, Jay is definitely implicated in the crime in some way via his knowledge of the location of Hae's car, either as an accomplice or the perpetrator. However, there are still some things that don't quite add up for the ""Adnan is innocent"" angle. The 3:32pm call to Nisha has not been adequately explained, and I'm not yet sure I buy the ""buttdial"" theory. I also don't understand why Adnan would call and talk to Nisha for over 2 minutes while he was in the middle of covering up a recently committed murder. Additionally, Adnan does not have a definitive alibi for the likely time of the murder or the burial. Nobody can say for sure he was at the library and track practice. His father said he was at the mosque from 7:30pm to 10:30pm, but Adnan placed a total of 7 calls between 9pm to 10:30pm, and as far as I can tell nobody other than his father said he was at the mosque. Maybe he left early, but that still seems like an odd inconsistency. Anyway, that's where I'm at. Thanks for the interesting subreddit. Overall, I'd have to say there's not enough evidence to really sway me convincingly in the direction of either of the two most plausible murder suspects."	20141129T011946

One thing bothers the hell out of me: How do they NOT know where the incoming calls came from? Is that not information that is available from the owners of the cell towers identified as ""pinged"" during certain calls? Has this been addressed? I read the FAQ end to end, and followed up with some searching based on key word, and I feel like I must be taking crazy pills that no one else seems as bothered by this gap in available information -- but it seems relatively straightforward to me: Somewhere, something knew what number was calling Adnan's cell phone -- after all, the call had to get routed. Why don't we?!"	20141130T035345
StaceyMS	4	0	"I'm a long time TAL fan and a bit of a legal junkie (I read SCOTUS opinions for fun) but I am not a lawyer. There are so many things to love about this podcast: The nostalgia: I graduated high school in 1998 so nobody in my class had cell phones. In 1999 I had a cell phone for emergencies and my then boyfriend (now husband) had a pager. If I so much as breathed on my cell phone it would cost me money. It would butt dial incessantly. The storytelling: recreating the prosecution's timeline and getting interrupted by ""there's a shrimp sale at the Crab Crib"" or the story of Mr S, the Best Buy CD theif. I feel like I'm there with this cast of zany characters. This is a delicate line that SK has to walk between being entertaining and reverent and I think she balances on it beautifully. The law: this is everything I missed in Civics class in high school. But personally I'm astounded by the ineffectiveness of his lawyer. Most of the procecution's case seems to be painting him as being set up to lose everything so in a rage he killed. I grew up in Detroit where there's a pretty good population of Pakistani people (most of them Muslims) and I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams any of them disowning their son over having a girlfriend. Would they be disappointed? Sure. But there's no freaking way that motive should have stood up in court. There's some strange racial bias there and his lawyer should have killed it as speculation. Also, I love, love, love Dierdre's episode. I have listened to it at least a dozen times. During one of my ramblings about this podcast to my husband he asked ""is it better for a wrongfully convicted person to be in jail or for a guilty man to walk free?"" And I told him that I thought that the innocent man in jail is worse because inherently the guilty man is walking free. If I were a member of Hae's family this podcast would destroy me. I would want the right person in jail and the police and judge seem so certain that re-hashing this case would just seem so invasive to me. I don't think we'll know the answer by the time this is over but I'm personally leaning towards Adnan being guilty. Because of Jay's knowledge of where the car was and Adnan not calling after the crime. If I were on the jury I think I could find reasonable doubt but as a spectator judging in the bubble of my car on the way into work I think he's most likely the guy who did it."	20141130T175931

WE_CAN_REBUILD_ME	6	0	Hi guys, I don't want to disclose my personal identity but I've been a major lurker here for a few weeks. I love Serial, particularly in terms of what its success means for audio storytelling in the future. This is an amazing medium and there are dozens of podcasts like and unlike Serial that deserve this kind of attention. (Ira Glass' midas touch should be expanded) I'm a very young journalist at a public radio station in a very small town in the midwest USA. Despite this, I'm looking to make a difference in the community in which I live. I feel that's my calling as a human being and how I have chosen to define myself. Regardless of how this investigation/story ends, Sarah and her producer's dedication to this single, very human story has been life-changing for me. I look forward to discussing it with everyone. My criticisms of the series: - an lack of understanding on race and how that played into both the criminal investigation as well as popular perception of the case. - lack of investigation in the investigation. I think the legal proceedings surrounding Adnan are continually toyed with and consequentially dropped - Production: sometimes Sarah uses a lot of emotional transition for the sole sake of transition. This is a double edged sword that I would love to discuss with fellow fans.	20141128T221742

superjimmer	3	0	Hi. Have never posted to reddit. Started listening to Serial first week it was released, figured out it was released on Thursdays (not Saturdays as I assumed probably thanks to TAL) the second week ... and have had a hard time sleeping Wednesday nights ever since. I could not believe how much pot these honor students smoked, I mean I could not believe how compelling this story is ... Seriously. The hook for me was the fact that Jay had Adnan's car and cell phone all day on the date of Hae's murder. It just seemed weird as hell and I couldn't stop listening. My conclusion changes daily as to who is responsible for her murder. I own a recording studio, have an MSW, and used to work in a felony courtroom swearing in witnesses and reading verdicts. The teenage crimes were always the most dramatic and heartbreaking.	20141129T020459

It adds another level to the podcast (plus has helped this week since there is no new episode). I don't have any cool professional experience, but I love reading true crime stories and watching TONS of Investigation Discovery (shows like Dateline, 20/20, etc). Excited to be here!	20141129T062559
3kidsdeep	3	0	"I go back and forth with Adnan's lack of outward anger in light of the blatant horror if all this has transpired and he is innocent. I get absolutely livid when I am accused of not being honest. But I am thinking of that immediate instance I guess. I have no idea what happens when you have to deal with over a decade and a half of digesting lies about yourself. Especially as a high school student who has to grow up and become an adult in the shadow of that lie. In the shadow of a murder. I'm having problems sleeping because I think of the Errol Morris documentary, ""The Thin Blue Line"". Randall Adams was incredibly calm when he discussed his wrongful conviction. He expressed no rage in his account. He was cerebral with his anger. After all those years. And the person that put him there was David Harris. At the time, a sixteen year old with a history of violence. He committed the murder. The interviews with David Harris were disturbing. He was calm. Insightful. And extremely believable. Like Jay. And he was guilty."	20141129T202915
kimmarie300	3	0	"I heard Ep 1 on TAL and thought ""this is great, can't wait for the next one!"" Then I got busy and forgot about it until Ep3 or 4 was creating some buzz, looked up the podcast and started streaming, hooked since then. Found this sub through Slate's extras which I was obsessively listening to/reading. First time I've thought it worthy to actually register for Reddit and post something. Gratitude to everyone that has contributed! I want Adnan to be innocent, everyone loves an underdog and a story of a wrong righted. I think he probably did it. I think there is no way there was enough evidence for him to have been found guilty, therefore a miscarriage of justice has occurred. And yet, he probably did do it....so no miscarriage of justice? Also I was a high school senior in 1999. Part of the fascination is pretending these are my friends from my high school in my hometown. And how we would all be dealing with it all these years later. I can't remember shit about any particular days from that year."	20141129T204836
budgiebudgie	3	0	Hi there. I'm from Australia via New Zealand and have been lurking for a while. First up, I was fence-sitting, but now have serious doubts about Adnan's guilt. Jay and Jen's statements, testimony and behaviour are bizarre. Total, absolute crock of. About me. I used to be a radio journo, a long time ago now, and did the police and court rounds for a few years. Never covered a whodunnit like this. I can't remember a single murder or manslaughter case where they didn't have a stack of evidence - DNA, fibre transfers, solid motive, confession, and so on - against the accused. Coming from a country that ranks as no.1 squeaky-clean on the corruption index, I found it hard to believe that cops make stuff up. Or that they would fail to investigate great, big, flashing-red, lines of inquiry. Until someone I know was arrested and charged with a serious crime, all on the basis of one incredible witness. Not murder, but damn near as bad. He gave a rock solid alibi witness at his first police interview (never spoken to by police, amongst other obvious witnesses). He had no record at all - not even a driving offence. The crime scenes didn't exist (yup, just made 'em up). I could go on, but you get the picture. It went to trial, right through to closing statements. At the point where the jury would have retired to consider their verdicts, the judge halted proceedings. All very dramatic. The Judge said the state's witness testimony was 'incredible', that the case against the accused was 'impossible', and he couldn't, in good conscience, hand it over to the jury with the possibility, however slight, that they may convict and a grave miscarriage of justice be done. So, there you go. I'm hooked. There are some disturbing parallels that make this strange story resonate with me. My friend got lucky. Adnan. Ner, not so much. Is he innocent? Can't say. But there's enough doubt to fill a chasm. Loving Serial's storytelling too. No issues with the gathering-as-they-go approach. It's like radio reporting where you update bulletins as new info comes to hand. They're simply updating weekly, except for your Thanksgiving…grrrr. Be thankful. Your Thursday is our Friday. Double grrr.	20141202T093919
giltcomplex	4	0	Greetings! I heard about this podcast a while ago and found the reddit, but didn't start listening to it until my painfully long car-ride on Tuesday to travel for Thanksgiving. I'm all caught up now and very confused. I don't have much speculation or theory to add. I'm not convinced Adnan is innocent, but I believe Jay and Jenn were more involved than either of them said. Besides Hae being killed in the library parking lot, Chris' version of events felt much more plausible to me than the one that Jay layed out. It feels much more likely to me that it was accidental/Adnan snapped than it was premeditated. I'm interested for SK to check back in with Dierdre in a later episode. I admire SK's dogged pursuit of leads and information, but that team seems like they have a leg up on her. I've also accepted we could just as well never hear from them because a) they could decide Adnan is guilty or b) their findings would need to be kept close to the chest in case they found something big that could lead to actual re-investigation.	20141127T160249
crabfishcakes	4	0	Hi am from the uk so didn't discover serial until episode 7 but have been hooked since then. I find the whole concept fascinating and its introduced me to TAL and this site as well. Love it all... the serious discussions, the humour and the parodies. My eyes and ears have been opened, thanks.	20141127T100640
anonymous	4	0	Hello everybody! I am one of those people who found out about this podcast just a couple weeks ago when it really hit the media. I binge-listened over the past week and am all caught up. This is such a fantastic idea for a podcast. I am surprised that it hasn't been done before (maybe it has, but just didn't get this kind of popular reaction).	20141127T123422
picklegirl123	2	0	"I've been listening to Serial since episode one debuted on TAL, and I've been lurking on reddit for, well, quite a while now. In my lurking I still have a few questions that have probably been answered or brought up by someone else, I'm just not experienced enough with reddit to find the answers. First, about the time of death. It seems that the time of death could only be estimated to within a week because of exposure. Wouldn't that expand the possible timeline of the murder, burial, etc.? Has it been discovered if Nisha's phone number was a short cut on Adnan's phone? I remember how different cell phones and cell phone usage was in 1999 and how ""cool"" it was that I could make a shortcut to just hold down a button to call a specific person. This would make the possible ""butt dial"" scenario more likely. Just a thought."	20141128T202415
Randolphcat	2	0	Hello, new member and first-time poster. I'm from the UK and started listening from Episode 7. I've also found the Slate podcasts great and enjoy coming here and looking at all the threads. I'm of the opinion that the conviction of Adnan is unsafe and feel that there is more to come out about Jay and Jen's involvement. I'm loving the detailed analysis that's going on here.	20141128T234539
vfxfilmfatale	2	0	thanks so much for having a place where i can obsess over serial! i didn't think i had time to add another podcast to my playlist, but, damnit, i kept hearing so much about serial that i figured i'd give it a listen. now i'm trapped in it like some poor soul in maximum security prison. before i started reading other people's theories, i was pretty sure adnan didn't do it, but now that i'm poring over other people's opinions and insights, i'm not so sure anymore. unfortunately, i don't have anything valuable to add as of yet, except for a big thank you and... ummm... ...mailkimp?	20141129T020529
MadisonDelta	2	0	I enjoy listening to NPR while on long road trips and my gf recommended the podcast. I think the case is weak and don't think Adnan should be convicted (I'm not saying he didn't do it)	20141129T043439
C-JaneJohns	2	0	Hi folks! New to this sub and primarily signed up to see what all the fuss is about. Not about the podcast (been listening since October) but about YOU all. Honestly I don't think I've ever seen a sub reddit get so much positive (or at least neutral) press before. Congrats on having an awesome subreddit!	20141129T063943
DuchessDelaney	2	0	I have been listening to the podcast and have become hooked, like many others. I have a law degree although I don't practice in the criminal field. I didn't think I was going to like the podcast. Actually, I have never listened to any podcast before this one. The Serial podcast was addictive and made the treadmill time go fast each day. But, now, with no new episodes, I have been trying some other podcasts.	20141129T091529
thetruthwillcomeout	2	0	Adnans fellow prisoners surely know what happened that day. I presume he has close friends in Jail. He has told them the truth. Whether he was innocent or not. If he was guilty they would not judge him. It be just interesting if she could interview one of his friends in Jail to see what his behaviour has been for last 15 years. Probably would not happen but really would like to get an insight into Adans behaviour in how he has dealt with the whole thing last 15 years. Maybe this post is completely irrelevant but I am certain one of his fellow prisoners know exactly what happened that day.	20141129T112531
jarleenc	2	0	Why does Jay never appear as a suspect to the police? He knows all about the crime, the location of the car, Han's clothing, the mention of the gloves. he seems to be manipulating everyone, his girlfriend, Adnon, the police. He changes his story three times, gets caught in numerous lies, and the police still support him? The most telling action of his was getting the shovels out of he trash and wiping off the prints. Well, if his prints weren't on there, why would he do it? And in front of his girlfriend. It seems to me that he committed the crime and was able to manipulate is high school friends into helping and supporting him. Why, all of a sudden, would Adnon murder this girl who he cared about? It just doesn't make sense. I believe Jay wanted to get Adnon out of the picture because he Adnon was friends with Jenn which was s threat to Jay. Maybe it is Jay who is the sociopath here.	20141129T144920
J_Gunning	2	0	Hi everyone. Just binged on the first 7 episodes within 2 days. Completely enthralled. Had my wife listen to the first couple, and it's crazy to go back and see how the story has shifted from Jay, Adnan, and Sarah's journey. The workings of the legal system in what would seem a an average murder case. It's a good excuse to watch the failure, and practice of critical thinking on the part of the listeners and characters of the tragedy. It's a great show, and am excited to see season 2 funded. A great little audio roller coaster.	20141129T150744
megnn	2	0	I started Serial on my flight home last Saturday and on Monday or Tuesday I finished all nine of the episodes, and on Wednesday I realized it was not a fictional podcast. I listen to a few podcasts but have only listened to TAL once or twice. Obviously my mind was blown, because it amazes me that during this whole discussion and listening to these detailed podcasts, that this was a real story, I am going through a re-listen and it is incredibly different to realize this is a real story with lives on the line, it makes the stories more real and also incredibly uncomfortable, I find it fascinating to listen to but it really is something outside my experience to suggest theories about actual people and their actual actions. But anyway, I love this sub, I think the mods are doing an A-mazing job for such a new and popular sub.	20141129T163415
Flicka411	2	0	"I'm new to reddit, thanks to Serial. I wasn't going to post until I saw the invite to CrowdMurder. Really?? A crowd sourcing game?? Doesn't this conflict with reddits admonition to keep the posts respectful of the fact that these are real people involved in real tragedy? I understand the power of crowd sourcing... It's already underway, thanks to reddit... ""Gaming"" it undermines reddit and brings real ethical questions. Please reconsider... Thank you."	20141129T164940

perejj2003	2	0	"Hello world. Sorry for any formatting issues, this is my first time trying this. I've lurked on reddit for a year or so, but recently joined for two reasons: 1. secret santa 2. serial podcast (6 weeks). As far as serial goes, I mainly only have one concern. Its kept me up for a few nights... why oh why, is K-ci and JoJo's 99' hit song ""All My Life"" not currently number 1 on iTunes? I saw someone made a serial ringtone, but comon guys, lets work together to make this happen. Everyone go download this great musical track and make it number one. I don't have a dog in this fight. Not K-ci or JoJo. But I do think we owe it to them to make them relevant again, at least for Serial Podcast purposes. - Cheers Guys."	20141129T190926
justasconfusedasyou	2	0	"Hi! I've been lurking here since about episode 3, when I had not yet successfully gotten any of my friends/co-workers listening and needed somewhere to obsess over every detail. This is my first post though. The one thing that I keep seeing posted here that really bugs me is the references to Adnan saying ""Jay who?"" when the police came to arrest him. What he actually says is (in Episode 4): ""They said some-something like 'we know what you and Jay did' or 'we talked to Jay'—and I’m like 'Jay? Jay—' like I had a look of puzzlement on my face—like, like 'what? What do you mean? Like what do you mean Jay?'” He wasn't trying to act like he didn't know Jay, it sounds like he was just genuinely confused about what they were accusing him of. Hence the username though, still just as confused as everyone else is. Thanks for encouraging the newbies to join in the convo :)"	20141129T192203
liz82x	2	0	I've been a long time lurker on reddit, but just came into this sub reddit today. I'm excited to get involved in the conversation. I've been listening to Serial since the beginning and am yet to decided on how I feel about Adnan's innocence/guilty. Unlike others, I don't even lean one way or the other. Ok, I'm going to try to jump in!	20141129T205146
tinyninjababies	2	0	I kept hearing about Serial and checked it out around the 4th episode and found it completely engrossing, while keeping in mind this isn't just entertainment. I regularly read this subreddit and finally registered. I have a tendency to lurk more than to comment.	20141129T205336
GoodyBluesShoes	2	0	Hi! Never posted on this sub before, but I do think something that no one else has said. I think Mr. S is most likely an accomplice to this crime and most likely helped the killer kill Hae. I'm upset they never talked about him again after episode three though.	20141129T205651

sawyerpants	2	0	I am trying to figure out why it would take 2 strong able bodied young men 20 to 25 minutes, according to Jay, to dig a 6 inch hole to bury Hae. I am a 50 year old female gardener, living in AZ with rock hard soil. Maybe I'm just a bad ass but it would take me about 5 to 10 minutes max.	20141129T213205
Zelbinian	2	0	I first heard about this on Thanksgiving and I actually ducked out of one of my friendsgiving events because I was so hooked. I've listened to the whole thing twice now. I now understand what addicts feel like. Is Adnan innocent? Ugh, I don't know. I'd be surprised if he was *completely* innocent and had absolutely no part in the demise of Hae, but I'm pretty much right there with Sarah on this: how he ended up in jail for this is the biggest mystery. Edit: Something else I've been thinking about. I had a really traumatic event when I was a senior in high school 12 years ago - my mom died. It was a really big thing and a big part of my life for quite a while. Still, if you were to ask me details about that time... there are a couple of events that I remember with clarity, but on the whole I'd be a terrible witness.	20141129T221542
blbunny	2	0	Late to the party: just binge-listened to all available episodes. I'm an attorney who no longer practices law. For me, the most significant fact is that Jay knew where Hae's car was. He could only know that if he participated in the crime, either before or after the fact. Jay said Adnan killed Hae; Adnan says he didn't do it. One of them has to be lying. For me, all the remaining evidence has to be considered in light of whether it suggests Jay is lying or Adnan is lying.	20141129T224045
ilouise	2	0	Hello all! First things first, I didn't realise Serial was based on a true story until episode 3... oops... haha! Second of all, I'm just beyond excited to see an online community such as this to support Serial, and hopefully, get to at least some sort of bottom of this! I'm not sure what I think about the case. I just have a strong gut instinct that Adnan either didn't do it, or his involvement is greatly minimised. I have my doubts about Jay's story/timeline and predict he and Jenn are more deeply involved than we know right now. However, this view is totally based on my gut feeling and not completely supported by evidence such as motive, etc. We'll see, maybe I'll come to a more rounded view as more is revealed to us! I'm very keen to explore the evidence more completely and see what happens, haha!	20141129T233207
scottmlewis	2	0	"Been lurking for a while. I'm the Scott who wrote into the Slate Serial Spoiler Podcast to predict that the Innocence Project effort will be vital for the plot of Serial. Specifically, I think what Dierdre's team concludes will be the conclusion/climax of this season. I'm a super fan of Serial not just because of the story and its intrigue but because, as a journalist and future of media type, I think it's extraordinary and fascinating. I think it's the most important quest narrative of the new digital age and it's going to have an impact on podcasting the way ""The Sopranos"" changed premium TV. But like most everyone, I have been almost as intrigued by the question of how she'll end this as by how it will end up for Adnan and Jay. Many people saw the episode with the Innocence Project as kind of a detour. I saw it as a clue, a breadcrumb so Koenig can find her way out of this forest."	20141129T235026
Dinoshores	2	0	Hey there, I've been lurking since... last night. I've been listening since yesterday morning and am all caught up and anxious for the next episode. I'm not sure where I sit on the fence about Adnan - I think he is probably guilty, but Jay also probably played a bigger role in this than he is making it out to be and basically cooperated with police to keep himself as clear as possible. Even in Adnan is guilty, the state's case against him was so weak and it was pretty unfair. I'm not sure I believe the cell phone records. For instance, I make a TON of calls on my phone every day and I'd be hardpressed to tell you exactly who I called and at what time we talked yesterday. I can understand why Adnan is having some trouble recalling details of the day, though. He was stoned off his ass.	20141130T005426
Kanmaewesto	2	0	At first thought Adnan was guilty but Jay, Jay, Jay! It seems so plausible to me that he was angry about Hae about to tell Stephanie he was cheating, and lashed out--he wanted to stab his friend for fun! Plus, how does it make sense that he became an accessory to murder because he was worried about Adnan snitching on him for selling weed? Plus him getting a lawyer before being accused is fishy.	20141130T011832
mrroget66	2	0	"Hi. I came just because I""m fascinated with Serial and wonder why no one brought this up (maybe they did and I missed it...): Wouldn't it make sense that one of those calls to Adnan's cell (that Jay had been holding onto that day) would be from Hae to Adnan. She'd get Jay by mistake and he'd tell her he'd come meet her bc he had Adnan's car. Perhaps she forgot something at school, etc. But either way it'd make sense the call at 2:36pm or thereabouts would be from Hae to Adnan (but reaching Jay). Jay would know where Hae was and for some reason they'd meet up. He'd get into her car, as he said Adnan had planned, and strangled her. Now for motive---the only thing I can think of is that it seems odd that it was on Stephanie's bday. Adnan had gotten her a gift earlier and pressed Jay about why he hadn't, going so far as offering the car and phone so Jay could go to the mall. It was that whole reason that Hae would end up reaching Jay instead of Adnan via cell. Perhaps Jay was annoyed that Adnan had one upped him with Stephanie and just as Jay had wanted to stab his friend (relayed jokingly recently by the friend, but that was no benign story) wanted to see how it'd feel to strangle? If Adnan could interact with Stephanie, Jay could do so with Hae...?"	20141130T014822
ser1al	2	0	Hello. My friend recommended Serial to me, knowing my interests, and she was right - I've been completely consumed by the podcast for the last few days! I am a neuroeconomist, studying behavior and the brain, and a long-time fan of murder mysteries, especially those written by Agatha Christie. From her stories, I've learned that you can learn a lot simply by listening to what the interviewees are saying. It is not necessary for the detectives (in her stories) to have physical evidence to link a suspect to the murder. Effective questioning and an appropriate application of psychology can be sufficient. Given my background, I think there are two things that can be done to understand the story in the case of Adnan Syed v. State of Maryland (in the case that physical evidence cannot be retrieved to link Adnan to the murder to prove he was there beyond a reasonable doubt): 1) Structural images (via MRI) need to be acquired of Adnan's and Jay's brains. If there is a lesion in the vmPFC, voila - we have a sociopath. 2) The interviews of Adnan and Jay need to be listened to closely. People tend to tell the truth, as it is the default, and you only need to listen closely to hear it. Since I personally cannot do the first (though I think one would find that Adnan has a lesion in the vmPFC), I have been listening as closely as I can. I have listened to each podcast a couple of times and thought for hours about Jay's and Adnan's choice of words, their pauses and intonations, and their inconsistencies (within and between). To me, Adnan is plainly telling us he did do it but he is angry and sorry for being friends with people that acted tough but were in fact weak when things got serious. This frustration could come from the fact that he depended on them to keep their mouths shut or from the fact that they had some part in egging him on to plan it, at least in his mind. His interview in episode 9 really points to this. Jay is telling the detectives that he did not kill the girl, but he has some additional role in it that he feels guilty about but cannot uncover in fears of being punished himself. His inconsistencies point to this. This role may be some conversation he remembers having with Adnan prior to the fact that he post hoc realized was the trigger Adnan needed to plan the murder. There are hints of this in his interviews. The above seems very clear to me. What is not clear is the extent of Jay's involvement on the day of the murder, the extent of knowledge Jay had about the plans prior to the fact, and the degree of premeditation on the part of Adnan (he did not purchase the cell phone for this purpose - that was one of two things he mentioned being in disbelief about during the trial). These are matters that would not change the outcome of the trial, but that intrigue me nevertheless.	20141130T025444

I_did_it_sorry	2	0	So, I used to lurk a lot on here (& since becoming addicted to Serial, have started again!), but was never much of a poster. Thanks for making it friendly for first-timers! My question is for people that think it was neither Jay or Adnon, how do they explain away Jay knowing where the car was? Like, I just saw a couple people mention that Don should be looked into more, but I just don't understand how you get past that...? I really wanted Adnon to be innocent, & at first I thought he was, but the more I learn the more I think he did it. I think it did not go down the way Jay said, so I think he holds on to that to try to get off as innocent. Really sad all around (yet totally fascinating!) So hard to go two weeks without! At least we have gotten more info to read in the meantime. (And of course this amazing subreddit! So addictive. I really should be asleep!)	20141130T061829
talieteach	2	0	Hi- I'm Natalie. I'm sucked into Serial, like everyone else. The more I started researching the show, the more I heard about the subreddit and decided that I had to see what it was all about. I'm new to reddit and this is literally my first post anywhere. I joined 4 days ago. I'm also a high school teacher and I'm hoping to use Serial to teach my Seniors this spring. Along with my general obsession reading anything and everything on this page, I'm hoping to find some interesting discussions to incorporate into my lessons.	20141130T160340

WWBlondieDo	2	0	Hello! I signed up for Reddit so I could participate in upvoting during the Tom Hanks AMA and hadn't really been back since until I discovered this subreddit through the magic of Google. :-) I first heard of Serial through a Bob Lefsetz newsletter but didn't actually attempt to listen until my 4-hour ride home after Thanksgiving with the fam. Of course, once I got home I had to listen to the rest so I ended up binge-listening to all 9 episodes that day. I don't know if Adnan did it or not (though I'm leaning towards believing he didn't) but I absolutely know that our justice system failed him. The state did not have enough to convict beyond a reasonable doubt and I hope that jury is listening to this podcast and they are all ashamed/aware that they have ruined a potentially innocent person's life. Anyways, I've become obsessed with reading through all of the Serial subreddits since finishing the eps and really enjoy the discussion. Can't wait to join in more!	20141130T180337
boris_dog	2	0	Hi, I'm from Brazil, yes too far. I am following the podcast and the discussion on reddit. I'm addict. So, in this point I think the whole Adnan's thing it's about the fact there isn't material proof against Adnan, so he has a chance to be free. But, I support the point if Jay did it or know who's did and was trying to frame Adnan, how was he so sure there wasn't going to be people coming forward who saw Adnan after school? Pretty risky framing your friend not knowing exactly where your friend was at the time of the murder.	20141130T194608
superguest73	2	0	Hey all, been listening to serial since it premiered and I love it. Made a short video showing what its like to be serial fan and am looking for a good platform to share it with other serial fans (which are surprisingly not as easy to find in IRL). This is the first serial subreddit i have looked into, but wanted to check if posting my video link was appropriate for this subreddit or if this is more a place for serious discussions and not really getting into fan vids. Let me know and if you have any suggestions for more place to post for serial fans. Thanks.	20141130T213640

GoshGollyGeeWizz	2	0	"Hello Fellow Serialites (my name for Listeners)....I have been a fan of TAL for quite some time as well as a fan of murder mysteries so I was very excited about Serial both as a commentary on the justice system and as entertainment. Though I am not new to podcasts and talk radio, I am new to Reddit. I just created an account solely to be able to comment and engage with other listeners. The initial post that lead me to create an account was a post by moneyonfire rewriting the first line from ""A Visit From St. Nicholas"" to line up with the expected season finale of Serial and I felt compelled to continue the poem. Anyways, I don't have any experience or in-depth knowledge of the legal system outside of the version that is portrayed to me through episodes of Law and Order so I am in no way an expert on anything relating to legal matters of the case but like many others I am fascinated by all of the mishaps and stretched truths. I genuinely struggle with whether or not Adnad did it as I seem to change my mind every episode, sometimes during an episode. I did however have a strong idea of another way that the events January 13th could have happened that has been virtually undiscussed in the podcast but discussed several times and on many different threads on Reddit and that is of possible involvement from Stephanie. The minute those words come out of my mouth to friends, or reading them back on my screen I know that there has been no discovery (at least to my knowledge) of actually evidence linking her to this crime so I'm not really sure how to explain it to others besides, ""I don't know, it is just something that makes sense."" I have seen a couple posts that put what I am feeling and the ideas bouncing around in my head into words in a way that makes a lot of sense to me, so I appreciate that greatly. After listening to episode 9 and hearing the popularity and reactions of the podcast start to creep in to the actual story telling, I am very eager to continue on this auditory journey. I know we are all still listening on our computers and smart phones, but it somehow makes my mind smile a little bit that so many of us have decided to turn the TV off and just listen. I think somewhere in that there is something really beautiful."	20141201T081554
crazyeyd	2	0	"I guess I've been lurking on Reddit for years, but my obsession with Serial and the case drove me out of the closet. Are we supposed to introduce ourselves? I'm just over 30, have a cute little family, work ridiculous hours in advertising, went to culinary school, have two dogs (one husky lab mix and one ""rescue"" pit bull), love planting things, culinary things, craft beer, wines, and gaming when I have time (never). In regards to other podcasts, I'm also a big fan of This American Life, Radio Lab and Snap Judgement. I've been completely consumed with Serial since the first podcast, binged them all in a day and then proceeded to consumer anything and everything I could find about it in my spare time. I have so many theories and more importantly unanswered questions. It's nice to have a place to discuss. And I guess that's me in a reddit post."	20141202T001734

penny1234	1	0	I've been following serial from the moment it was on TAL. I wake up at about 530 every Thursday morning to get my serial fix and have found many friends who are just as obsessed. While listening to a pop culture happy hour about serial, I found out about this subreddit and hit myself in the head for not even thinking to look for subreddit. Anyway, I've been reading all the posts and have been very interested in different ideas/angles. I teach science and have been interested in the actual evidence/lack thereof and the social behaviors of these kids. I have believed adnan from the beginning but mostly just for the lack of evidence and empathy for the fact that he is serving a sentence with lack of sufficient evidence. Additionally, I went to high school during this time so there is definitely a nostalgia to serial for me. Thanks for all the awesome posts!	20141129T163604

SunDevilMichigan	1	0	"Hello all! I posted once w/o posting here. Accidentally broke one of the rules (my bad op). I work with complex adaptive systems (CAS) and data mining/machine learning. My background is in the natural sciences and wet labs (harvesting bird organs). I think that Serial may play out like a Martin Scorcese movie, great beginning and great middle... and then in the end ships come and blow up the fight scene and everyone dies or doesn't care about the battle scene (ala Gangs of New York.) My real theory is that Jay knows too much. I think Jay may have been slanging on the side got into some trouble and because of this Jay's ""higher up drug dealers"" threatened Stephanie and/or his grandma. This explains the mysterious ""he"" that Jay references. He never says ""Adnan"" threatened me, ""Adnan"" would hurt her... Jay always says ""He"" threatened to hurt Stephanie (maybe an editorial effect but even in the taped interviews he never says Adnan. Also, the ""alpha"" Jay doesn't sound like he would be scared of Adnan. Who wants to chip in for some sodium thiopentothal and a van to go to Baltimore? :)"	20141130T165946
KnitTriLove	1	0	Hello! I am a big fan of This American Life so I was excited for spin-off podcast. I am a lawyer and social worker who has worked mostly in the juvenile system. In addition to the interesting legal aspects of the case I am also interested in the ethics. In particular the impact on bringing the case up again for the family and witnesses. I am also interested in the idea that public voyeurism enables time to be spent on a case to look at the evidence in depth. I came to Reddit for the first time via the Serial Spoiler Special. I am still figuring Reddit out. I find the external information about the case to be very intriguing. I would really like a definitive answer to this case, but I am not hopeful.	20141130T174433
saxsolos	1	0	Hello! I am completely new to reddit and this subreddit. I posted my first post the other day. I haven't posted other than that. I love Serial. I have been listening since the first week, and I have been listening to TAL since almost the very beginning - since 2000. I adore the podcast as a piece of journalism, but I'm not expecting any big answers, though it would be nice. The show is particularly interesting to me as this is all taking place on my home turf. I've been slowly going through old posts and reading everyone's thoughts. As far as the case itself, I'm not quite sure what to think. I want Adnan to be innocent. I don't know if he is. Jay as a witness is unreliable to say the least, and I believe that he was much more involved with Hae's murder than he is admitting to. I really wish that he had allowed the producers to interview him on tape.	20141201T032302

Same question for the papers filed for the appeal?"	20141201T122332
digiham	1	0	"I'm a HUGE fan of Radiolab, to the point of even downloading every episode to my computer, saving each to my phone and having them all ordered and indexed for easy access (yeah...a bit obsessed maybe). And although that has nothing to do with Serial, except the fact that both would be considered ""podcasts"", the reason I say this is because thanks to Twitter's recommendation of who to follow based on ""Radiolab"", I'm now completely addicted to Serial. I've only checked out Reddit a handful of times, but every time I have, it's deemed itself useful. I'm not normally a hardcore internet junky like I've always perceived Redditors (or Redditers?) to be, but I'd consider myself at the very least, Web-savvy, to the point where I know how to get around and know some pretty basic Internet lingo. But for the most part, I try and stay OFF social media and the scary interconnectedness of the Internet whenever I can. Which brings us back to Serial...the show is so good and has me so intrigued, that I've now found myself engrossed in wanting to talk to others about the case, to the extent of finding this section and finding the need to sign up for Reddit...which leads me to what I'm surprisingly currently doing. All because I want to discuss more SERIAL! So, thank you, Reddit, for providing a place to meet my silly needs to discuss something with others. (P.S. - I just had a funny feeling I haven't had in a decade or two...like I'm in a chat-room?! Weird.)"	20141201T202613
wannabe_yinzer	1	0	"Hi everyone- longtime reddit lurker and so very thankful for this subreddit! I finally bit the bullet and joined. I binged listened all 9 episodes during my Thanksgiving travels. I'm wondering to all those out there who did the same or similarly binged-listened at another time: do you wish you had listened to each episode as they came out week by week? I DO! I feel like my mind has been racing for the past few days trying to digest all of the content from these 9 episodes I've just consumed in such a short amount of time.... I can't turn the serial thinking off lol. Luckily I have friends in the same position and we've done a ton of emailing back and forth today. I should get them to join in on the sub! It is really just so interesting to see everyone's theories. I could go down the serial reddit rabit hole for hours and hours, and I have no shame in doing that. Originally I was set on ""Adnan did it."" But episodes 8 and 9, particularly, have me questioning his guilt. I have never been so excited for anything (tv, movies, books) to come out than I am for episode 10!! I really do think they have something big to drop, with two full weeks to prepare, combined with all the sleuthing that has been done on reddit :)"	20141201T204501

You're just regurgitating something that *the podcast itself has said*. Admittedly, though, it seems to make a lot of us cynical (myself included) and there are/have been a lot of new redditors that have contributed awesome things to the discussion. Welcome aboard!

PowerOfYes	3	0	Hi and welcome. Are you over the referendum yet? About the sleuthing aspect: it's pretty clear that at all times we're well behind SK's own investigations. Her producer, Dana, said as much in an interview - they check the sub but haven't seen any avenues of enquiry they hadn't followed up. What's the value of all this investigating: it makes us listen more intently to the show and fills in the details, I'm not sure anything really new has been 'discovered'. And the reason for that is, of course, that the 'truth' is uniquely within the control of Jay and Adnan. Only truth serum will help. The Innocence Project: they have in fact taken up his case and are about to file a motion to allow them to[ test the evidence kit taken from Hae for DNA against two new suspects](http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/serial_sarah_koenig_adnan_syed.php). At the same time, he still has an appeal pending, which his appellate lawyer is working on. As these matters are pending and no submissions have been filed and AFAIK no court date has been set, nothing about Adnan's situation will resolve itself by the end of the show, or even, I suspect within the next 12 months. As for a jury: appeal decisions are made by judges, no jury involved. A jury would only be required if the conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered. I think you overestimate the reach of this show. It might be the biggest podcast, but it's a pretty niche market. Honestly, I don't think it would be hard to find 12 people who had never heard of this case or the show, even in Maryland. If the case was re-tried, Adnan might prefer a judge-only trial. It's really hard to say.	20141130T110138

PowerOfYes	1	0	Congratulations on starting with the best podcast - sadly, you may not find anything quite so addictive, but that's probably a good thing. I would recommend This American Life (there's a good app which lets you access old podcasts). Here are some threads where other users list their favourite podcasts: http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2jep4b/what_other_podcasts_are_you_listening_to/ http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2mgyti/serialrelated_podcasts/ And here's a compendium of TAL episodes: http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2lr3dr/what_are_some_this_american_life_episodes_you/ Welcome and enjoy!	20141129T101645
Jakeprops	3	0	Thats interesting. I wonder if she could or has tried to interview other prisoners. I suspect they wouldn't have any other info. Like they said in the podcast, he is well liked and respected in the prison. He's known for his good cooking, and people look out for him because he's so well liked. Your post also assumes that what Adnan has told SK conceals the truth. If he's been forthright with her, then other prisoners prolly would tell you the exact same thing. Thanks for your interesting comment.	20141129T184116
Jakeprops	1	0	That's a good question. Thanks for chiming in on the conversation and welcome!	20141129T184355

Jakeprops	1	0	I think that no matter what the outcome, our criminal justice system ought to be able to hold up to incredible scrutiny. We should be able to reexamine convictions so that as a law abiding citizen, I can sleep at night with the confidence that I'll not be unjustly imprisoned and if I am, I have a hope to rectify the injustice. If he's guilty, we should be able to reexamine to case to confirm it. If not, so that he might earn his freedom.	20141129T232215

I also am very interested in the future of radio and podcasting. Like what they mentioned in the #startup podcast, wouldn't an interactive, multimedia podcasting app be just amazing? And so very possible. Someone build it! Welcome again and thanks for your interest and contributions. Let us know if you see ways we can make this forum better.	20141130T000337

ser1al	1	0	I thought about this too in the very beginning. Adnan argued that he had not lent his phone to Jay in the detective interviews. It is possible that Jay had taken Adnan's phone unbeknownst to Adnan, but that would require premeditation on the part of Jay and given Adnan had purchased the phone a day or two prior, it is unlikely that this is the case. I also do not think there was a call from Hae to Adnan on the day of the murder.	20141130T030535
PowerOfYes	1	0	Would a lesion on the vmPFC not generally impair decision making and affect social function? It just seems startling to me that no one has identified a lack of empathy or other traits in Adnan that would point to a serious underlying issue with the prefrontal cortex. It seems curious to me that he would be able to put on a perfect mask for so many years and not once slip up. Also, even if someone has vmPFC lesions, it's not conclusive of them being a sociopath, is it? It might explain behaviour they're actually displaying, but can it really tell you the likelihood that someone engaged in an isolated violent act 15 years earlier? In any case, it's an interesting idea. Welcome to the sub.	20141130T052749

PowerOfYes	1	0	Hi, good to hear from you. I too think it's puzzling that people think someone unrelated to Jay might be the murderer. However, I'm one of the people who thinks that it's possible, if Jay is involved, for an older friend of Jay to be an accomplice - someone who may have threatened Jay into compliance. I have a hard time believing these kids came up with Leakin Park all by themselves. But we may never know. Only 3 or so more weeks to go - what will we do with ourselves! Welcome!	20141130T063344

erin333	1	0	"I have studied sociology and psychology and behavior extensively. One thing I know for sure is that we like to believe liars and often ignore the truth even when it slaps us in the face. We want to protect our ""truths."" I am curious of your opinion of the last episode where he says ""you are going crazy trying to find out that he is innocent but you're not because he is guilty"" and then Adnan goes on to say that the only one that knows is him and then as an afterthought adds on the and whoever killed Hae. People usually tell us who they are and I think he did in the last episode. But true to life and human nature, we are distracted by details and our own narratives that we will ignore what he actually said to us. Then he goes on to tell her to play the middle to keep it confusing. I think both Jay and Adnan were involved and are lying about the whole thing with the attempt that confusion could get him off. But Adnan did it so they know the right guy is doing time. That is my truth. I heard the confession loud and clear from Adnan in that taped piece."	20141220T221729

The most patient are probably the most engaged int eh field and new developments in the sphere. The best thing about Serial is that it has wide appeal. It has the capability bridge that gap between our very insular, yet very powerful, world of audio storytelling.

ser1al	1	0	"Thank you! Glad to be here. It would impair certain types of decisions and social intelligence, but if the person has a high IQ (which Adnan probably does), my feeling is that they can replicate normalcy. You're correct - a vmPFC lesion does not guarantee sociopathy, but it can help support other lines of evidence in a case. It would not be wise to base an argument solely on neural data. According to research by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, there are not distinguishable neural differences between chronic and remitting offenders. So just because Adnan acted relatively perfectly for the fifteen years since, the areas of the brain shown to be different with control subjects (vmPFC, OFC, or amygdala) would still be different if they had been so at the time of the murder. Also, there was a study (published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in January of 2009) that showed that there are differences in the fear response of people who end up being convicted for crimes and the rest of the population. Adnan could be tested for his fear response. Again, taken by itself the results could not say much, but they can lend support to an argument. I don't think these are necessary however, because as I mentioned, if Jay's and Adnan's words, ways of speech, and inconsistencies, are closely considered, they are telling us everything we need to know. Episode 9 is a great example. Towards the end of the episode, Sarah is interviewing Adnan. This interview really stood out to me because up until then, Adnan had not directly defended his innocence. I would have to check the transcripts of all the episodes to be sure that this is the only time he talks directly of his role (or lack thereof) in the murder, but if my memory serves me correctly, it is. He had used logical tactics and questioned technicalities before, but he had not defended himself directly. In this episode, Adnan defends himself twice: 1. ""what happened to me, happened to me, I had nothing to do with this right?"" 2. ""no way, I had absolutely nothing to do with Hae's murder"" There is a major problem with both attempts at defense however. The first part is a question and the second has a double negative. So really, he has unknowingly told us he's not sure he's innocent and actually, he is not innocent."	20141130T063658
koryisma	1	0	THANKS!	20141130T050558
I_did_it_sorry	1	0	Yes, his ever changing story is awfully suspicious.. and full of holes that seems he is hiding something for sure.. But idk what it is. Level of involvement? I don't know why I don't want Adnan to have done it- it would be the best thing if they got the right guy, albeit in a shitty way (too much reasonable doubt, imho.) But it does seem like many people hope he is not guilty (me included). Why do you (or anybody) think that is? Someone did it, & if it wasn't him it means the real person has been free for 15 years, and somebody who is innocent was found guilty of an awful crime, & locked up because of it. Shouldn't we be hoping Adnan did it? Is it just because he seems likable? We don't want someone that seems that normal to be capable of such things? Or it adds more drama? Anyone have any theories as to why we are hoping they got it wrong? I really hope we are better people than that it just would make for a better/more entertaining story..	20141130T072936

joshuarion	1	0	"I guess for me, I keep imagining what I/people would think about the case if Jay was prosecuted instead of Adnan... The prosecution could easily say ""Jay is the only person with demonstrable knowledge of the crime scene and the victim's car's location..."" and ""by the defendant's *own admission* they had possession of Adnan's cell phone the day *the cell phone tower pinged the victim's burial site....* and I think that looks super, super bad... I'm not saying Jay killed Hae, BTW, I'm just saying that IMHO Jay could be convicted way, *way* easier than Adnan could given the evidence. Adnan was never caught lying to the cops either and Jay couldn't keep his story straight... I don't know who did it and I have never (not once) made my own ""This is Totes My Theory"" thread of the case because, frankly, I find most of them a bit presumptuuous. We're here listening to a podcast of journalists who have spent *over a year* investigating and us amateurs are here speculating. MOST threads are nonsense. I haven't looked into it but I remember **three** ""Adnan and Jay Were Gay Together* threads. There's no way to escape bias if you're listening to the podcast, so there's not *really* a way to claim ""Objectively, XXXXXXX"" even if you try... This to me is at the heart of the issue. Everyone weighing in on this subreddit is biased, I think we all should at least admit it, even if we're not sure which way the bias leans. I also think that, given that Adnan even told SK that he'd been speaking super, super carefully because he didn't want to construe himself as trying to bias her, that most of what he says that *sounds* super incriminating by the ""pause analysts"" could simply be him trying to figure out how best to respond. I don't know... That's mostly the point. If we examine the objective, unquestionable and least human-tainted evidence, **I** feel like we either have a dismiss-able case against Adnan or a weak case against Jay. But that's just my opinion, which, by my own admission, is biased. :)"	20141223T111206

They were statements that attempted to explain why he does not, after 15 years, point the finger at Jay. It's a much more philosophical enquiry. Also, the second statement does not contain a double negative. It's two separate sentence fragments which say the same thing. Two ways of indicating his disagreement with the idea that he had something to do with her death. This is in the context of him explaining that although he didn't do it, he feels that if he had been a good Muslim (no drugs, girls, sex, hanging with the wrong crowd), maybe he wouldn't be in jail. I realise that depending on one's viewpoint, that could be taken either way- if he was really that manipulative and smart, he'd know better than to be so ambiguous. I think it's dangerous to rely on these isolated sound bites out of hours of conversation. There's also some externalities that might affect how he spoke, how he sounded etc: he's on the phone, in an open area, in a jail, talking to someone he doesn't really know whether to trust, you can't see him or assess his body language, neither could SK, we have no idea what came before and after this part of the conversation or when the conversation happened. Most important, you don't have the opportunity to hear him in any other context, to assess even his baseline communication skills and quirks. I will bow to your greater insight due to your studies, but from all we know about court rooms and judging people, it is extremely difficult to tell someone is lying by demeanour, and even more so if all you hear is a disembodied voice on less than 30 seconds of tape. I'm not suggesting Adnan is innocent or guilty, but I do think that people (and I can't exclude myself from this) seem to come to very firm conclusions based on very little information by filling in the gaps with inferences drawn from their own experiences and views of the world. That's not a dispassionate or objective analysis. Interesting debate, we're having on the newbie thread. LOL"	20141130T071457
PowerOfYes	2	0	For me it's not about hoping he did or didn't do it. It's more about how we can be so certain that Adnan did it, when the evidence is so full of holes and the key witness is so unreliable. It seems so unsatisfactory a basis for putting a 17 year old in jail for life. I'd love to know whether the jurors from the trial have been listening and whether they think they're hearing totally different stories. Trials are just such a fake version of the truth. (not that we may ever know the truth).	20141130T075924

I can only help you if you're pinched in BK. :) It is noble in many ways, sure, but as a defense attorney I was taught an important lesson- my career is not going to be the innocence project, my career is the guilty project. In that I mean that I'm doing this work not to exonerate the innocent, but to respect and uphold the rights of the guilty. Honestly, nothing terrifies me more than representing a truly innocent client....because it is so damn hard to win, and so much is at stake. Thanks for your excellent moderating!	20141201T041306

ser1al	1	0	"Point well-taken. I took two very small snippets without first describing the context and the question he was addressing. That being said, I do not think the question ""did you kill Hae?"" is conceptually different than that of asking if Jay is lying (Sarah's exact words were: ""Well, you can blame Jay if you think he's lying""). Jay not lying implies Adnan killed Hae. Would this not make them equivalent? I do agree with you that the second statement could be viewed as two separate sentence fragments, thus not being a double-negative, and I believe this may have been his intention. While his conscious intention was to emphasize his lack of involvement by repeating the negation, I think he may have been subconsciously telling the truth. I completely agree about the danger of relying on isolated sound bites and I do take into consideration the location he's speaking from, the time that has passed since the incident, his knowledge that the conversations will be publicized, and his possible mistrust of/hopelessness for others' involvement. On the point that we haven't heard him in any other context, I disagree. In the same episode when he is recounting the details of his Feb. 28 arrest and about waiting in ""bullpens,"" he sounds different. The melody of his speech and how often he pauses sounded much different to me than when he is talking about the time before Hae's murder, the day of the murder, or the time between the murder and his arrest. And in referring to his own description of the bullpen situation, he uses the word ""honestly"" for the first time. But again, I'm sure there is a lot that we have not heard in the episodes so there is a chance he's used a variant of the word ""honest"" at other occasions in the interviews. I may be guilty of expressing my views passionately but it is so hard to be completely objective... I am a newbie after all :)"	20141130T092420

Even if the police somehow thought that it was suicide at that point, I'm sure that a decent coroner might have helped them out. People can't kill themselves and then dig a hole. That's what people are trying to explain to you.	20141127T024907
samsexton1986	0	0	This is my theory too, Hae's body was found near a fallen tree that would have made an acceptable place to hang from.

anonymous	2	0	well... They of course dug a hole and put the dirt in a bucket, which was held aloft by the rope so that when she was released she fell in the hole and was buried, except for the hair that Mr. S spotted as he went for a leak 127 feet from the road.	20141127T045334

anonymous	-3	0	Perhaps the English language is hard to comprehend for most people. My thoughts are why the bottle and rope could have been there. I never said it made perfect sense, it was an idea that perhaps they wanted it to seem like a suicide. Perhaps they were going to use the rope to tie her body to a rock and throw it in Dead River Run. But then they decided nah, burying her would be the better option because of cars going past or whatever. It wasn't an iron clad statement to say that, that was exactly what the rope was going to be used for. The notion that you people seem to think that is beyond my own comprehension, perhaps I should have made it a bit clearer. Edit: Hence being marked as a discussion rather than a theory, but obviously trolls coming out from under their bridge might have missed that.	20141127T030154

How could an inexperienced monster kill a person that way in the small amount of time available according to SK when she retraced the route to Best Buy.	20141127T035606
ShrimpChimp	3	0	Glad you brought this up. As far as I can make out, manual means that there's no evidence that the murder used a rope or wire or belt, etc. Some people seem to be interpreting manual strangulation to mean someone facing Hae choked her with their bare hands.	20141127T025910
anonymous	3	0	Interesting. Would the type of choke hold be discernible in the autopsy?	20141127T031922
anonymous	3	0	I am not sure what the Medical Examiner's words mean. Do they mean that Hae was strangled with bare hands, definitively? I am sure a rope or similar would leave different markings, which could be easily distinguishable from hand-marks, maybe?	20141127T052238

EngineerinLA	4	0	"I think the lack of ligature marks on the neck with other indications of suffocation leads to a manual strangulation determination. I would assess that ""manual"" means without any other devices to include arms and hands. Plus one item never postulated is what if the killer knocked her unconscious with a punch of some kind, and then killed her by strangling her? That explains why there was no DNA under her fingernails or other signs of a struggle. This seemed to me to be the most plausible scenario (I highly doubt her killers would scrub her hands clean if there was a struggle) and it follows the theory that her killer acted out in an initial rage (punched her knocking her out) and then coldly finished by murdering her not wanting the initial indiscretion to be discovered."	20141127T071800
Irkeley	2	0	I agree. Where did you read about the lack of markings? I've only found parts of the testimony of the coroner, and its vague. I was thinking he/she was going to say something in the line of it being difficult to determine so long after death, but that's just speculation. He/she was cut off by the prosecution. There was a rope at the crime scene, and she did have bruising on her head. I can't find anything about what it was from or if it knocked her unconscious.	20141127T100556

So I don't understand if the implication is that it mostly appears not to have been caused by any other implements, but that there is a possibility of that, based on ....???.... what, we don't know, because they were cut off and we don't have the coroner's reports."	20141128T220232

pitydfoo	2	0	No, there is no evidence indicating that the death was then; the only partial evidence is that the murder (or at least some incident) occurred before 3:15, when she would ordinarily have picked up her cousin. The 2:36 call could indeed have been about anything, from anyone.	20141127T031337
Woodsaw	2	0	No, It's just about impossible that Hae was dead at 2:36. In episode 9 a friend of Hae's explains that Hae was talking to her until after 2:36 at the school on the day of her murder which makes it unlikely that that call was involved with the murder at all.	20141127T062841
prettikitti89	1	0	Though the cold kept the body well preserved, the six weeks it took to find her means time of death can only be roughly approximated. It depends on how cold it was between Jan. 13 and the day her body was recovered. Someone in this sub suggested that if her stomach contents were still present (if the body were adequately preserved by the cold weather) we could tell how long it was between her last meal and the time she died. That sounds feasible to me and I wonder whether anyone did this type of analysis.	20141127T041045

The genuineness and ambiguity of Adnan's behavior during his arraignment and early time in prison. His subsequent stellar behavior record. The small but poignant en memoriam of Hae Min Lee. It's the one I have trouble bringing myself to listen to again because we see how devastating this was for everyone on every side.

EngineerinLA	5	0	"Gutierrez did not ""blow it"" to get more money on appeal. She was a highly sought after defense attorney who was so busy that when she became ill her professional life became an unmanageable mess and she was willing to be disbarred in lieu of trying to put everything back together (my speculation but makes sense). No lawyer wants to lose and hope to make more money on appeal. Rabia's a smart woman and the dumbest thing she's ever said is this must have been the case with Gutierrez. The first thing you do after losing is fire your attorney - how does Gutierrez profit from this or from the loss of prestige in losing a murder case built on one witness and zero physical evidence? The OP's theory isn't crazy, but I doubt Adnan and Jay had anything worked out in advance. I'm betting that Adnan knew Jay would come off as not credible (miscalculation) and keeping quiet with no alibi was the best he could do. I'm friends with defense attorneys. The first thing they find out is whether their client is telling the truth or not. If the client admits they did it, they fight to poke holes in the prosecution's case enough to get reasonable doubt proven and/or hope for conviction on a lesser charge. What they don't do is go looking for alibi witnesses (perhaps why Gutierrez did't take Asia's letter seriously) or demand that the State get DNA testing off a liquor bottle at the scene (because your client admitted to you they did it). They also NEVER let their client testify. This isn't just because they fear cross-examination. A lawyer can be disbarred for knowingly letting their client commit perjury on the witness stand. The code a defense attorney uses when their client demands to testify, and the defense attorney knows the client is lying, is the defense attorney will tell the court that their client will be ""testifying by narrative"" and the defense attorney asks no questions or adds anything to the testimony. This helps the lawyer to keep their law license when the lies come out that the defense attorney knew about beforehand."	20141127T073909

anonymous	1	0	>when she goes missing and anyone in her circle is frantically calling her I don't know that this is true. It sounds like almost everyone thought that she was with Don that night -- a new guy whom few people had met but whom Hae was crazy about. The frantic calls seem to have been coming from her family . . . even Aisha doesn't seem that worried at first. She called Adnan on his new cell to say that Hae's mom had called the police & that Adnan might be getting a call from them. Note: NOT to say, OMG OMG where is she??? It would make me suspect him more, not less, if he'd made it a point to call her house (which was forbidden by both their families) or called her pager (when as far as he knew she was perfectly safe and wouldn't want to be found). Tangent: I just realized today that the story about how Hae might have gone off to CA is a lot less weird than it sounds. She lived in CA with her relatives there for half of her sophomore year. She was also known to be having some kind of issue with her mom.	20141127T052717

anonymous	1	0	There are various possible explanations you can give to this data point. He murdered her and knew she wouldn't answer. He didn't think it was a big deal. He was stoned out of his mind. He thought she went to California. He heard she couldn't be reached and decided to not to try. He saw no point in trying since she was missing. You're assuming the first one is the only one but we really have absolutely no idea, all seem plausible, because we can't see inside his head	20141127T064351

FlockWalk	2	0	And I agree with you-- if I were on that jury, knowing what I know from listening to Serial at least, I would not feel comfortable convicting Adnan of this crime. Out of all the inconclusiveness, reasonable doubt in this case seems conclusive. But, responding to the comment up above-- even if Hae's circle of friends were not actually too concerned, at least immediately, I'm still thinking that when SK confronted Adnan about why he never called Hae, he seemed to lie. He said that he didn't typically call her but relied on her friend as a go-between. But he did typically call her, apparently with some frequency, and late at night, too. So why did he lie to SK?	20141127T055343

But he did typically call her, apparently with some frequency, and late at night, too. I could be wrong about this & I'm sorry if that's the case. What I heard from that conversation was that it wouldn't have made sense for him of all people to be ringing her house once it was clear that she was gone -- that someone like Aisha or Stephanie could much more easily be calling her home to check in & bringing news back to others. This rings true to me because if Hae really had taken off somewhere & her mom didn't know how to find her, then her mom was flat terrified. She doesn't seem to have had much English, and she didn't know that Adnan and Hae were lovers . . . wouldn't it make sense for the ex-secret boyfriend to rely on girlfriends for news? That's how I heard his response: that during that time he let others call for information. It doesn't answer why he didn't try her pager, but again -- that could be read either way. Surely a guilty Adnan would consider sending a page or two just to have it on the record? But wouldn't an innocent Adnan at least try once, just to see if she'd answer him when nobody else was getting a reply. idk.	20141127T064858

FlockWalk	2	0	Yeah, the pager gets me. And more, it just seems to me that Adnan, and perhaps Hae, too, had some pride in being able to get in contact and talk by phone, despite their parents. They had their methods (hence the midnight call on the first day he has his phone; and, he called her several times throughout that day trying to get in touch, to purportedly give her his new number). But then all of the sudden when SK asks him about it, he says, no, we used a go-between. Maybe he is just referring to during this time of duress, but I didn't hear it that way. Maybe he was stoned and just didn't get preoccupied about if his friend was missing-- but again, if cops are talking to him about it . . . wouldn't he at least selfishly want to get in touch? By page? I guess what I'm putting my finger on is the one moment so far where I have been surprised by SK-- she's so scrupulous and helpfully doubtful, but when Adnan tells her this, it goes over so smoothly and quickly. I keep waiting, thinking there will be a follow-up, the way she's followed up about Cathy's narrative, etc.	20141127T070527

You don't just blow that off and continue eating your turkey sandwich. You call her, you cal your mutual friends, you call SOMEONE! You don't just take get that call and disregard it, not like that happens everyday. And as jonnybryce mentions, Adnan doesn't seem like that disconnected, unsympathetic guy--he is social, has lots of friends that he asks things from, does things for. Totally out of character. Again, I believe Adnan and I don't think he killed her, but out of everything so far in Serial, this one little fact is oddly the one that I can't rationailze.	20141127T160911

anonymous	38	0	I am a defense attorney. That is absolutely NOT how defense attorneys approach a case. Whether my client did it or not means absolutely nothing to me. I need as much information as I can get from them and I encourage them to tell the absolute truth so that I don't run into surprises, but you really never know what really happened. There is another camp of attorneys (mostly white collar defense) that deliberately tell their clients to NOT tell them if they did it or not, because they can then ethically allow them to take the stand (it is a violation to put your client on the stand if you know they are going to perjure themselves.) I believe in regular criminal defense this is a bad strategy, but that is my personal choice. Either way, you never really find out if your client did it. Ever. You can take your best guess and that is it. We don't NEVER let clients testify- our code of ethics dictates that clients make that decision, we can only advise. Not leaving this decision to your client would get you disbarred. However, I would respect her decision to advise Adnan not to testify in this case for a number of reasons. But, I agree it is unlikely she threw the case on purpose. That would require as much nuanced planning as winning it would, in a lot of ways. As you said it is far more likely she was ineffective because she was ill and overworked. But I don't see that as an excuse. My case load is 120 and I would have won Adnan's trial. (Not hubris, most competent well-trained attorneys would win this case.) Your statements about criminal defense are incorrect, however.	20141127T134936
Workforidlehands	35	0	I'm of the opinion that the theory that she threw the case on purpose is humbug. I think it more likely that she saw the evidence was weak and therefore chose to simply let the prosecution try to prove their case without calling Adnan to the stand. This then backfired because her illness was causing her skills as a defence attorney to fail her. I think she decided the prosecution can't prove this beyond reasonable doubt and did a poor job of ensuring that. I'm not saying Adnan is innocent or guilty - this is just an observation of the court proceedings.	20141127T115246

She defended Jacqueline Bouknight, accused of killing her young son. In 1991, lawyers for the boy sought to sanction Gutierrez for advising Bouknight she did not have to disclose her son's whereabouts. He was never found. When Gutierrez represented John J. Merzbacher Jr., a Catholic school teacher convicted in 1995 of sex offenses against a female student, Gutierrez **failed to tell him of a plea offer**. Gutierrez committed perjury in her testimony during the post-conviction. Syed's first trial ended in a mistrial because one of the juror's heard the judge call Gutierrez a **liar**."	20141127T142936

What you say about her professional life being a mess due to her illness makes sense. She probably should have removed herself from the game earlier on. Some say she was an amazing defense attorney, and some say she was unethical, maybe even corrupt. Probably she was different things to different people and at different stages of her career. The excerpts we've heard from her on the show sure are hard to listen to -- her voice is so grating and she sounds very aggressive. Hard to think that her style didn't have the opposite effect from what she intended. Interesting to hear from the different lawyers."	20141127T110044
tanveers	14	0	I think we start going down the slippery slope when we make generalizations about entire fields of work, based on a few interactions or friendships with people who work in said field. Knowing a few doctors or auto mechanics doesn’t make me an expert on the workforce in either the medical field or auto repair industry. I know a multitude of doctors, people I grew up with, but I’m not running around on WebMD telling people what most doctors would do in their situation. You’re right Cristina Gutierrez, the bulldog of Baltimore, was a highly sought after attorney in Baltimore along with Warren Brown, Billy Murphy Sr., Billy Murphy Jr. and Ed Smith. Like any profession weather it’s your local postal worker or police officer, there are going to be very honest and ethical people and there will be the people who are way less moral. If you get the opportunity ask your friends, if they have ever shaken down a client in the middle of a trial to get more money. I watched as Leonard Redmond of Redmond, Burgin, and Gutierrez – shook my family down for tens of thousands of dollars as the trial went on with threats of quitting mid case. I remember Redmond telling my father that he knew how much money was in his and my mother’s bank account and that they needed to pay another $30,000 or they are dropping out. When my father told him that he’s near retirement and can’t shell out money on demand – the firm advised him that he should take a loan against the family’s house. I think in the end RBG thought that my dad and the community was going to be an ATM for their firm. My father, a well-educated civil engineer employed by the State of Maryland for over a quarter of century, who was in his mid-sixties when this went down was not technologically or legally savvy enough to know that lawyers can’t just go to the bank or hack some system to find out how much money is in your account. This went on for the entire length of the first trial and the second trial until she was axed after the conviction. As many people have pointed out, she didn’t get fired after the mistrial, maybe her arrogance led her to believe that she would be able to convince the family to give her a shot on the appeal. Also, you mention that, “writing an appeal is certainly not something a trial lawyer would want to do.” I thought most lawyers work in groups to expand the appeal of their practice. Couldn’t a law practice of even only three lawyers have one lawyer specialize in criminal law, another lawyer that specializes in appellate law, and a third lawyer for estate law? Wouldn’t they all share the profits? I thought it’s getting rarer to see a single attorney like Kevin Urick who just goes into solo practice and puts out a shingle on the street advertising their services.	20141127T151758
mostpeoplearedjs	5	0	I'll second that the 'lost on purpose to make more money on the appeal' part doesn't make any sense. Trial attorneys are usually fired when they lose. In the typical case the defendant and his family spend every dollar they have on the trial defense and then use a court appointed attorney on the appeal. In terms of how defense attorneys handle cases, there are different models- listen to Deidre's interview. Some attorneys never ask about guilt. Even if you assume Adnan is guilty, there's no evidence he confessed to Guittierez, nor does it seem inevitable. She clearly had significant issues in her practice and may well have been ineffective. I think the most likely explanations of her failings was a combination of her poor health and an overreliance on the state's case's own weaknesses. (As in, why work hard to impeach a guy who already did it for you 3-4 times?)	20141127T130117
EnIdiot	4	0	I'll join the ranks of people with criminal defense friends (as if that kind of knowledge Ruby's off). However, I've walked through a number of cases with my best friend since childhood who is the said criminal defense attorney, and it seems like it is a common ploy to claim ineffective counsel when making an appeal. I'm from Alabama, and at least on death row cases most appeals begin with the argument that the old attorney was ineffective and that is why I need new representation and a new reconsideration of the facts. I think Adnan would have had to claim this even if Gutierrez hadn't died or been disbarred . He has to come up with a new reason (evidence, procedural issues, or representation (or all three)) in order to get a new trial. He's best shot is a new trial where newer exculpatory information gets presented. I do think, however, that Gutierrez had some serious issues medically and ethnically that I would want a retrial for Adnan (just as a citizen). I'm obviously not a lawyer, but I am a citizen and fairly well informed about civics and the like. I do not think Adnan got a fair day in court.	20141127T152852
dmbroad	5	0	"Sarah Koenig canvasses other Defense Attorney who tell her it is *inconceivable* that a DA would not at least speak with an eye-witness who could provide an alibi (Asia). This is likely where Rabia is coming from, trying to ""conceive"" of an excuse for Guttierez losing a case that any competent defense attorney could have won -- much less one who was ""highly regarded."" But neither are Guttierez' private peccadilloes and sickness an excuse. Guttierez behaved unethically any way you look at it. If she didn't want to do the investigative work on the case, she should not have swindled the Syed family out of their money -- while putting their young son's whole life in the balance. I personally find her despicable for this and would not be defending her actions in any way. Because if you look at the excellent blog post, ""Serial: A Comparison of Adnan's Cellphone Records and the Witness Statements,"" (link below)...it would have been *so easy* to poke holes in Jay's story. For instance, it is impossible that Jay could have dropped Adnan off at track. And so cell-data shows that Jay had to have driven Hae's car *alone* -- with her body in the trunk! -- to the I70 Park-and-Go. (What a nice accomplice.) Then needs to get a ride back to his house (4:27 and 4:58 calls that ping at Jay's house -- shovel retrieval) and then back to where he left Adnan's car (reason for calls to 3:59 Patrick and 4:12 Jenn -- needs rides). Instead of CG's attacking Jay, building her whole case on his being a liar.... She could so convincingly have told an alternate story showing exactly how Jay acted alone based on the cell data. Guttierez never gave the jury anything *but* Jay's story to believe. How could she have become ""highly regarded"" without knowing this? This also answers the question: ""How could Jay have known that Adnan did not have witnesses?"" He didn't! That's why he tells the truth about Adnan going to Track Practice and picking him up afterwards. Only in hindsight could he have known that Adnan would have no witnesses and so Jay could have lied about that, too. Because Guttierez is not looking for any eye-witnesses for whatever her personal problems, that's for sure, i.e., Will. Didn't she have a private investigator supposedly working on this for her, according to Sarah Koenig? Probably more likely that Guttierez simply billed the Syeds for this phantom private investigator. If Jay had lied about Track, the timeline could have included Adnan up until 6:59. But still would not account for the 7:09 and 7:16 Leakin Park cell pings...in which again, Jay is acting alone to bury Hae. Because Adnan's father's court testimony has to be believed that Adnan was at the Mosque from 7:30 to 10:30. But first, Adnan would have had to stop home (the 6:59 Yaser call that pings at the tower by his house) to pick up the meal his mother prepared for Ramadan and then walk it over to the Mosque by 7:30. It really looks like if Christina Guttierez did not intentionally ""throw"" the case...she still just phoned in Adnan's defense (pun intended). The Innocence Project won't have any difficulty citing ""subpar legal representation."" 15 years after a young man has already spent almost half his life in prison.

Anyway, I agree, I think there's no chance Gutierrez threw it. My hunch is, like you said, she was busy, she was in the early stages of being sick, and she was in over her head. She most certainly did a poor job. One thing I don't agree with: Adnan has always said, ""I don't know,"" or ""I don't remember"" when asked about significant details of that day. I don't think there's much risk of perjury when that's your defense. She probably just thought his lack of affirmative memory regarding that day wouldn't have been very compelling. But, clearly the jury wanted to see Adnan up there, so just like her plan to annoy Jay into cracking backfired, so too did her election not to encourage Adnan to take the stand. Those two things, coupled with her negligence in even following up with Asia look bad. Very poor judgment indeed."	20141127T145550

goliath_franco	2	0	I agree that it's not clear that Gutierrez tanked the case either purposefully or accidentally. One can imagine that it *might* be the case because she later did take one or more clients' money without doing the work. But I haven't read anything concrete she did that would be questionable except for not following up with Asia on the alibi. On the show, they run this by at least one lawyer who says it's baffling that Gutierrez didn't at least talk to Asia. I don't know the legal ins and outs to know whether it might make sense not to talk to Asia. That would be the one sticking point with her defense work that I know about, though.	20141127T085944
asha24	4	0	Thanks so much for clearing up what the private conversations between Adnan and his attorney must have been about. I find the degree of certainty in your post absolutely baffling, other defence attorneys on this sub and on the podcast have said they cannot understand why she would not have even talked to Asia before she dismissed her. Also we know the murder could not have happened at 2:30 since Hae was seen at 3 and the state's timeline has been bunked, if Adnan is guilty and he told his lawyer they would both know this as well (Adnan would obviously know when he really killed her), so putting Asia on the stand would not have even been lying, because if Adnan killed Hae it could not have happened when Asia says they were together.	20141127T112656

In fact it did seem like a strategy. I can't be bothered to search the transcript, but when asked why he was so calm about the sentencing, Adnan says it was because he saw it as just a step towards the appeal which ""was what we had wanted all along"" (approximately). That makes me wonder if his team hadn't told the family that it would be the appeal that was their best shot from early on. Anyway, I think we'll learn more about these issues later (next episode?).

Perhaps it's a different strategy, or perhaps they want to make sure they have credibility in front of the judges to which they have to present countless cases. Of course you never really know what happened. But it's best to know where to spend your finite resources, and chasing an alibi that your client tells you won't exist isn't a great plan. I agree that being overworked is a shitty excuse for being a bad lawyer, I agree that my criminal defense capabilities aren't sharp (I'm an engineer not a lawyer), and I agree there were multiple reasons for Adnan to not testify. I was presenting my thoughts as to why Gutierrez didn't throw the case and why Asia's alibi wasn't pursued. It's not too far fetched that Adnan admitted his involvement in Hae's murder to his lawyer. Following your own logic that would probably be something Gutierrez would like to know when attempting to defend him against Murder 1.	20141128T212940

First, her letter says: ""...I will try my best to help you account for some of your unwitnessed, unaccountable lost time (2:15 - 8:00; Jan 13)..."" Which is completely nonsensical. Two, she goes to his parents' house after he is arrested like some deranged fan. She says in her letter she ""doesn't know him very well"" and that: ""We aren't really close friends, but I want you to look in to my eyes and tell me of your innocence"" Who the fuck says that? Keep in mind that she has NO idea when or where the murder was alleged to have happened, and thus has no idea whether her alibi is significant, yet she goes to a virtual stranger's house the day after their son is arrested to tell them how calm he was that day? Asia is just not reliable, and as we later know she completely recanted her statement.

I would never let someone perjure themselves. And in this case, Adnan did not have to testify in order to put on an alibi defense. I also said I don't think that Gutierrez intentionally threw the case. But not talking to an alibi witness is ineffective. That has absolutely nothing to do with perjury. What if Asia saw him at a particular time of day that alibied him for the state's timeline? But lets say in reality he killed her two hours later? My job is to put on a defense, I know the state is going to say it happened at 3:20 and I know I have an alibi witness for that time. Boom, I've done my job. This is obviously a quick hypothetical example of why this comes into play, and why it doesn't matter if my client is guilty or not: YOU STILL INVESTIGATE A CASE. That is my job.

asha24	1	0	According to the article the prosecutor confirmed that Guttierez never approached him about a plea deal. Though you're right it does seem like it would be difficult to prove that Adnan would have actually accepted a deal.	20141127T155840
Archipelagi	2	0	"We don't have the trial transcripts, but podcast definitely makes it sound like Adnan's counsel was very coy and indirect in how Jay's inconsistent testimony was presented to the jury. It's hard to know. But her cross-examination was so inept: >Cristina Gutierrez: So the answer to my question is “yes, I was not telling the truth,” is it not? >Prosecutor: Objection. >Judge: Sustained. The objection there was to the phrasing. It's too confusing, to unfair to the witness, and whatever answer he gives, it's likely to be unclear about what specifically he means. You can't waltz up on cross-examination and go, ""It is not true that you were telling a lie about not having not gone down to the store that night?"" The witness has to pause to figure out the answer, and the pause can make them look like they're lying. Hence the objections. As a result, it seems like Gutierrez never got her point across. It seems most likely, though, that the jury went with a ""gut feeling"" of believing that Jay was ""telling the truth."" It seems like he definitely kept his composure on the stand, anyway. But that ""gut feeling"" is pretty much evidentially worthless, compared to the objective evidence."	20141127T155628
anonymous	3	0	Not contacting an alibi at all is ineffective assistance. Not comparing the phone records to Jay's testimony to effectively destroy it. NOT CROSSING HIM ON HIS COOPERATION. That one gets me more than anything else. It should have been very easy to make Jay look like a lying, self-serving murderer getting a deal from the state (again, doesn't matter if he is or not, I'm talking defense theory). Adnan being guilty really doesn't have anything to do with how winnable this case was. IAC claims are really really hard to win. Doesn't mean the lawyer wasn't ineffective.	20141128T013740

mostpeoplearedjs	3	0	"This opinion describes the testimony. http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/Published/107118.p.pdf In particular, on pages 3-4: In July 1998, Merzbacher petitioned for post-conviction relief in state court arguing in part that Gutierrez and Kanwisher provided constitutionally ineffective counsel when they failed to convey the ten-year plea offer to him and advise him of his options with respect to that offer. . . . Over five days between October 2000 and February 2001, the state court held hearings on Merzbacher’s petition in which the court considered testimony and legal argument. Merzbacher offered the testimony of Gutierrez, Kanwisher, and himself; the State cross-examined all three witnesses. . . . As for the plea offer, Gutierrez testified that in Judge Gordy’s chambers, in late 1994 or early 1995, the State ""essentially agreed"" that Merzbacher could plead guilty to one or two counts—rape and child abuse—in the Murphy case ""for ten years"" and ""that all of the other cases . . . fifteen or sixteen of them would all be nol prossed."" In her view, this was a firm offer with terms ""somewhere between ok and good . . . . I’d put it not quite good but as good as it’s going to get."" Following Merzbacher’s conviction, Gutierrez recognized her duty to communicate this offer to Merzbacher, but testified that she had failed to do so because she was moving her office and very busy when the offer was made, and later, while preparing for trial in this case, she never ""thought"" about the offer. Gutierrez acknowledged that, although plea offers were ""on the table in a lot of cases"" that she had handled, she could not recall ""another case"" in which she had failed to communicate a plea offer to her client."	20141127T175336

asha24	0	0	Jay has also changed his story multiple times and was given a sweet plea deal, it could be argued that he was just trying to cover his ass, while Asia had nothing to gain, though obviously the defence would have had to prepare her for the stand. It would have been the smart high school girl with an internship vs. the criminal element of Woodlawn who buries dead bodies in his spare time. I'm not saying they should have for sure used Asia, but the fact that the defence didn't even talk to her is odd.	20141127T153917
asha24	1	0	I have looked at it myself and I didn't read it the way you did. I understood it as her saying she can account for some of the time between 2:15-8, that issue has been debated several times on here. Also I don't see what her not knowing Adnan well has to do with anything, she's an alibi witness not a character witness. And I didn't read the Justin part as some nefarious plot either, she said she didn't want to be involved originally, but that Justin had convinced her to come forward with whatever information she had. That being said I think the Asia letters are weird, I'm just not ready to assume that she completely made it up for attention. The Asia letters have been discussed ad nauseam, the only reason I brought them up was to point out that if Jay can be made to seem credible (see Rabia's information dump,) with his stories about hit men etc. then I think it would have been possible to make Asia seem credible. However, at the end of the day those letters don't really matter because the state's timeline is bogus anyways.	20141128T141646

Not to mention in Asia's letters she mentions the fact that two other people are with her and remembers seeing Adnan as well. As to Jay being involved, it could have also been argued that Jay knew the police would wind up on his door step, he knew they had the cell records, so he had to implicate himself a little bit in order for his testimony against Adnan to be taken seriously. Not saying I think this is what really happened, but I think a believable argument could have been made in court. And let's weigh who has more to gain. According to you Asia will gain popularity vs. Jay who avoids being charged with murder or whatever charge the police could pin on him.	20141127T163401

asha24	1	0	I don't think Asia's statements are worthless because she retracted, I think the argument could have been made that she retracted because she thought the prosecution had better evidence so Adnan had to have been guilty and so didn't want to help him, and that she wasn't aware how crucial the time she was with Adnan was. I think the Asia alibi is worthless because the state's timeline is wrong, we know the murder didn't happen when they say it did, so Adnan could have been at the library with Asia and still murdered Hae (but I guess this wouldn't have mattered at trial since the point is to disprove the state's case). Adnan's last appeal was about the Asia alibi and Gutierrez's decision not to use it, the judge ruled against it.	20141127T191552
asha24	1	0	They already filed an appeal on that issue, that's when Asia retracted her statements, and the judge did not find Gutierrez incompetent, the judge said it could have been a strategy or something like that.

What a shame her alibi wasn't investigated at the time and possibly corroborated or proved wrong by asking the two people she says was with her. Leaving aside Asia, the police should have investigated Adnan's vague alibi that he was at the library. There was probably some kind of record of who used the computers at the library, there may have been datestamps on his email account. That could have given him an alibi too.	20141129T143250

anonymous	4	0	"> Didn't Nisha herself confirm that she spoke to Jay and Adnan on January 13? You are right, she hasn't. She might not have been telling the whole truth in court about all this, for who knows what reason. Who knows. Anyway, this whole Nisha call is a very big deal, even if it's been trashed a million times, because it is one of the only pieces of ""evidence"" we have. What I would like to get an answer to is: what is the probability that a 2:20ish call made on this phone by a person(s) traveling in a car in 1999 would have been a butt dial. I mean, what proportion of calls would be butt dial? Would it be very low, like 0.01% or less? Or would it be higher, like 5%? Is there anyway to quantify just how unlucky Adnan would have been, if it was indeed a butt dial?"	20141127T103329
stravoskoiladitis	2	0	"Okay, but you have to clear up something really important: it might be that you would be charged from the moment you hit the ""dial"" button (and not from the moment that your call was answered), but this does not necessarily mean that you would be charged for calls that were never answered! So the question is: back in 1999, did mobile phone companies and, in particular, Adnan's company, charge their customers even for calls that were never answered? If this wasn't the case, then your theory doesn't work. A call would not show up on the log if it hadn't been answered, which means that for the Nisha call to show up on the log, it had to have been answered, even if only by an answering machine. But the rub is that Nisha says they had no answering machine, so it has to have been an actual physical person who answered the phone and stayed on the line for 2 minutes talking to the caller, and the implication is that this caller was Adnan, because Nisha didn't know Jay well enough to chat to him for 2 whole minutes and, in any case, denies having ever done so."	20141127T105209
Irkeley	7	0	Just a note. What we heard on the podcast was from the *first* trial, that was later declared a mistrial. In this first trial Nicha is on stand testifying, and the prosecutors asks her if she has an answering machine. She replies, *no, not on that phone*. They don't ask her about voicemail, but maybe that's implied. Her not having an answering machine supports the prosecutions case and is therefor included in the testimony. However, in the second trial (the real trial) the prosecution can choose to change what they present to the new judge and jury, and for some reason they chose to take out this from Nicha's testimony. This I see no reason for, unless they discovered that she did in fact have answering machine or voice mail. This didn't support their case, so they took it out.	20141127T095009
brickbacon	7	0	"First, we are looking at a call log, not a bill. Even if the phone company billed from send, that doesn't mean those call lengths include ringing. To argue that it does means those multiple two and three second calls to Hae and Krista make no sense. Even if you argue the Hae calls were him seeing if she was on call waiting, the Krista calls earlier in the evening make no sense. Two, a butt dial only makes sense if she is on speed dial, and we only have Adnan's word on that. Trusting him without question makes no sense just as it makes no sense trust Jay without any evidence or logic. Three, the ""fact"" that Jay didn't work at the store then comes primarily from Adnan's PI quoting the store manager. I'd like to see some more solid evidence of that before we assume it's true.

mke_504	2	0	I haven't seen whether that particular number for Nisha was a land line or cell phone. If it was her home phone number and a butt-dial, couldn't the call have rung for a couple of minutes, then someone picked up and just heard noise so they hung up. I know it's still not clear whether the length of the call would include the ring time (because of the other 2 second calls, etc), but according to that CBS article it was typical to give a period of free ring time (like 30 seconds). Once you exceeded that, maybe the ring time showed up in the log. [Edited for clarification.]	20141127T151853
anonymous	2	0	People butt-dial my home line often enough, and I sometimes listen for several minutes. Am I the only one who does that?

carontheking	1	0	You cannot dismiss the call because Nisha said they were at the video store. She just probably got that part wrong. I don't understand how you can go from her being confused about the location of Jay and Adnan to being certain this has to be a misdial. The call obviously was Adnan's way of proving he was with Jay at the time, which would've been his alibi had Jay not turned on him.	20141127T143901
anonymous	1	0	It could have been a butt-dial or just wrong number and Jay and Nisha just talked for a bit. People do that, especially teenagers. It wouldn't necessarily have been so remarkable that Nisha would later remember and report it.	20141127T181535
WhirledClub	1	0	Why don't we have the SCAMP data? It would not only show if the call was answered, it would also show if the cellular signal was handed off from one cell tower to another--indicating the location of the car during the call regardless of whether it was a butt dial. Furthermore, if you can determine the last place we can verify Adnan's location near the time of the call and it's not close to where the call originated, he couldn't have made the call.	20141218T130103
namefree25	-1	0	"Must we assume that the length of the call on the log is accurate? Could the call have been shorter than 2 minutes? Did phone companies round up to the nearest minute?

Or am I confusing billing practices with the call log?"	20141127T170021

anonymous	1	0	But if you listen to the testimony, Nisha starts to explain that the Jay and Adnan call happened after Jay started his job at the video store, but the prosecution sort of cuts her off and doesn't really give her a chance to clarify the date. So there's basically nor reason to believe that Jay was *definitely* present during the call to Nisha in January. It makes more sense that it would be a butt-dial (Jay probably had the phone in his pocket) than that Nisha is so drastically misplacing when the call took place.	20141127T223544
charitablearm	1	0	"I have a few things that occurred to me that I have not heard other people suggest. One, I remember being young with my first cell phone in 2002, and having a cheap plan where I always had to watch out or go over my minutes. I was a schoolteacher then, with no landline, and I'd call parents from my cell. I used to hate how, if no one picked up, I'd often get charged for a minute for a useless call (voicemail). I know there was no voicemail, but this just reminds me that at least for my company in 2002, they definitely rounded up. (EDIT: I read in another thread that it was measured at 2:22 minutes, more precise, so forget what I said here!) Two, isn't this a landline? And do we have reason to believe it is a private line/that no one else besides Nisha would answer that phone? If not, if the company rounds up, I can totally see Jay, or whoever had the phone, having a 1 minute 10 second conversation about Nisha not being there (it's right after school finished), and the person being like ""who is this"" etc. Three, to me (one who thinks the whole thing involved both young men, but maybe others, and maybe drugs or something else that keeps either of them from telling the whole truth), I try to think about if it wasn't Adnan, about what if Adnan isn't even IN the car. Couldn't you imagine a 1 minute, 10 second conversation from Jay to Nisha about ""do you know where Adnan is?"" if they are dating (and Jay has his car)? Or a conversation of that length explaining why someone besides Adnan has his phone, if Nisha picks up? As SK says at one point, everyone has attached meaning to each of these calls that fits with the timeline, but we will never actually know the content, and if the timeline's not real (that phone booth's existence, for example), we should think more broadly."	20141127T233321
serialisgreat	7	0	This is a great question, but I think it's relatively easy to address. After looking around, I don't have a definitive answer, but I have seen some information on the Internet from around 1999 about incomplete calls *not* being charged unless the phone rings for over 30 or 60 seconds. However, I don't think that's really relevant. If we know that ring time is included when the call *is* answered, it means that whatever log mechanism is in place includes the ring time in its description of the call length. And I would find it very, very unlikely that the log itself does not include unanswered calls, even if they are not ultimately billed to the customer. So I think a 2-minute call would likely be recorded as a 2-minute call regardless of whether (1) somebody picked up after 2 minutes of ringing, heard rustling noises, and then just hung up, or (2) the phone just rang for 2 minutes and then the call was terminated by the caller.	20141127T122930
jfedoga	4	0	If that were true, the defense would know about it. The fact that it didn't come up at trial and has never come up in the podcast suggests to me that nothing changed factually with Nisha between the first and second trial and the prosecution simply decided not to use her testimony the second time.	20141127T171053

Just that it is a possibility. > Lastly, Why would Nisha testify against the guy she was dating if she wasn't fairly sure she was right about he call and the answering machine? Nisha never claimed that the call when she spoke to Jay was made on January 13. She simply stated that there was only one time when she spoke to Jay and Adnan, and that one time was when Jay was working at a video store and Adnan went to visit him at the video store. Adnan told her on the call that he was at the video store where Jay worked and he was going to put Jay on the line, so she should say hi to Jay. As it turns out, this one time could not possibly have been January 13 because Jay was not yet working at the video store on January 13."	20141128T022734
FeelinGarfunkelly	1	0	Why would it round to 2:22 though? That's a pretty specific rounding for a log. The bill might round up to 3 minutes, but we have been given the log.	20141128T023927

stravoskoiladitis	2	0	I think what we really need to clear up is what exactly it is that appears on the call log.

mary_wv8633	1	0	Nisha didn't know Hae. Never met her or Stephanie. She went to a different school and Adnan met her on NYE. She testified because she was subpoenaed by the prosecutor as one of the main elements of their case was timeline establishment via the cell phones. The Nisha call is the ONLY call that could connect Adnan being near or in possession of his phone during the time they argue Hae was murdered. Of course now other witnesses seem to point that Hae's murder actually occurred at a different time, but I'm thinking since all the surrounding calls are to people Jay and Jay alone knew, it's likely that the Nisha call was an accidental call that just rang and rang. Nisha also stated the only time she spoke to Adnan and Jay was actually weeks later, but Jay lied about that as well in his statements to police.	20141207T164207

It's certainly plausible that he accidentally sat on the speed-dial button. I know I (personally) make accidental calls multiple times each week. Now, I'm not saying that there's a huge statistical probability that this happened. BUT I do think that it's more likely than the claim that Nisha misremembered the details of the call, and that she misplaced its timing by nearly a month.	20141127T230612

anonymous	1	0	OK, that's my question I suppose. How probable was it that Nisha was on speed dial? Then what was the probability of this butt-dial happening? Then we can weigh that up against the probability of Nisha not remembering a call on that day (at that time), or perhaps remembering but not saying she remembers. So you reckon it's way higher than 1%? So, say, 1 in 20 calls made on that phone would have been butt-dials? Mmmm, I find that very hard to believe, but at the same I never owned one of these phones.	20141127T234458
Irkeley	2	0	I just think its dodgy. Adnan was very surprised when he learned that she had testified to not having one. He said he could swear she had one. I'm guessing she had voice mail.	20141127T180903
anonymous	3	0	I thought it was confirmed that Nisha was on speed-dial? As for the probability of an ass-dial, like I said, it's not as unlikely as people seem to think it is. I do it all the time. The probability of a butt-dial is really hard to work out exactly, but I really don't think - given the type of phone in question - that it's anywhere near impossible. Finally, I do believe that Nisha's remembering correctly. Remember, she says that she only talked to Jay and Adnan at the same time during *one* phone conversation, and she said that it happened weeks after the murder. I don't think it's likely that she would forget talking to Jay before the call from the video shop. And Jay's story about the Nisha call claims that it was the first and only time he talked to her. I think it's more likely that Jay is lying than that Nisha's forgetting.	20141128T003240
mary_wv8633	1	0	Even if she wasn't on speed dial she could have been accidentally called from the most recent list. Adnan was apparently calling her a lot. And I think the phone was admitted into evidence and the police looked at the speed dial list to verify? I read that on another thread, anyway, but can't remember where.	20141207T164627
jfedoga	2	0	Maybe so. I was just pointing out that your conjecture that there was new information about an answering machine is very unlikely because of how criminal procedure works.	20141127T182628
anonymous	0	0	"> I thought it was confirmed that Nisha was on speed-dial? I believe that it was only Adnan who said it was so. > I really don't think - given the type of phone in question - that it's anywhere near impossible. Agreed. But how far from impossible? > I do believe that Nisha's remembering correctly. Maybe > I think it's more likely that Jay is lying than that Nisha's forgetting. Jay is a liar, so that could be true. One thing is that Jay tells the cops on 3/15/99 (the weird 2nd conversation) that the call was ""maybe like 7-8 minutes, 10 minutes, something like that"" and that Adnan ""put me on the phone with her for like 3 minutes"". It would have been better for all of us if the cops had told him how long the call was."	20141128T013037
anonymous	1	0	I think the bigger point is that *if* the call to Nisha was one of the best pieces of evidence that Adnan was with Jay at that time, why would the prosecution drop it from the retrial unless they found out that it wasn't valid?	20141127T223259
anonymous	1	0	I am pretty sure it is in the second trial. Does anyone have the full transcript of Nisha's testimony in the second trial?	20141127T225849
anonymous	1	0	I think I wasn't clear - the detail about *when* the call took place was mentioned during the first trial, but not (I'm pretty sure) during the second. Based on how SK reported it, it sounded like the prosecution actively prevented Nisha from explaining that the call with Jay and Adnan didn't happen on the date of the murder.	20141127T230244
anonymous	1	0	Yes that's correct, that was clear.	20141127T230859
anonymous	1	0	ah, ok. I've seen good explanations that the call could have been an ass-dial, and that the call could have been recorded even if nobody picked up. But I think that even if people disagree about that, none of it really matters if the call that happened the day of the murder *wasn't* the call where she spoke to both Jay and Adnan.	20141127T231629
anonymous	1	0	Yes, but we don't know that. To be sure of that, we would also have to take it for granted that Nisha's recall is perfect and also that Nisha is telling the truth.	20141127T234819
anonymous	1	0	If it comes down to Jay vs. Nisha, I'm more likely to believe Nisha, because we know Jay lied about *many* other aspects of the case, and because Nisha has no reason to lie about this. I also find it improbable that she's remembering it wrong. She says that she only talked to Jay and Adnan at the same time on one occasion - and that it was also the only time she'd ever talked to Jay. I think that she'd remember if she talked to Jay more than once, because she only knew him through Adnan. And she says that hen she talked to them, it was after Jay had started his job at the porn shop - not a detail a teenage girl is likely to forget.	20141128T003725
anonymous	1	0	No, it comes down to Jay + cops vs. Nisha + butt-dial. On the face of it, who would believe Jay + cops? But there's a couple of things you have to get through first. What is the probability that that call that day would be a butt-dial ... and ... how likely is it that Nisha would remember the details of that call (x weeks/months earlier) ... and ... > Nisha has no reason to lie that ain't true, unfortunately	20141128T013443

allthetyping	9	0	As I listened to her interview in ep 4, my first thought was to wonder what she would be charged with. Like you say, she knew all this on the night of the 13th, and said nothing.

If they based the 1st degree murder charge on Jay's testimony that Adnan said he was going to do it, gave Jay his car and cell phone saying ""I'm going to kill Hae, come and pick me up after"" wouldn't that make Jay guilty of accessory before the fact? (or whatever it's called, probably just accessory)."	20141127T164911
PowerOfYes	3	0	It's true, accessory charges might be harder to establish - it's more about the fact there we're no charges for anything!

wtfsherlock	4	0	The U.S. has a lot of prosecutorial discretion to decide what to prosecute and what to not prosecute. The D.A. decided keeping Jenn as a cooperative witness was more important than charging her. It doesn't surprise me, the choice was try to convict a murderer, or try to convict Jenn at most as an accessory.	20141127T172513
anonymous	2	0	are you just that immoral? Sorry that my moral compass isn't as messed up as yours but if my friend just showed me a dead body, I would first try to talk them into contacting the police and if they didn't then I would.

anonymous	2	0	That's my theory as well. Jay's cooperation might have been strained if Jenn was charged.	20141128T000946
giltcomplex	2	0	I don't envy Jenn's position- I personally believe she and Jay were more involved than either said -but if she truly had nothing to do with it, I would resent the hell out of Jay for dragging me into a murder. I see getting her involved as some kind of collateral- Jay tells her about it so perhaps she becomes just as much an accessory as him, should she decide to rat. ANYWAY. TANGENT OVER. Since conspiracy is an aspect of accessory and multiple people can be involved in a conspiracy, I don't think there's a limit to the number of accessories. I see what you mean, though, that she'd be sort of a 'second accessory once removed', but I have no idea whether who-gets-who-involved is something pertinent to the charge or not. The evidence against her is overwhelming enough for the charge that I don't think not being directly enlisted by Adnan would be a huge hurdle, though.	20141127T160948
MsRipple	2	0	Yes, but I would have ~sworn~ she was a he, based on her voice. I guess I was giving her too much credit, though. I thought maybe the guilt got to her and she made the call...but it sounds now like it was...the guy mentioned in Rabia's post.	20141127T225647
PowerOfYes	1	0	don't get me wrong- I get the strategic decision. But as a juror would it not (to borrow a phrase) affect your assessment of her evidence if you knew the DA went easy on her so she'd testify against Adnan? Edit: typo fix	20141127T235007

He tells her stories about jail. >June 8. “You should send me some pictures. We’re allowed to get them. Man, some guys in here get some really dirty pictures..."" While it's not clear, I would assume the prom was still a topic on conversation in the letters and he was simply curious to see photos from what would have been his own senior prom.

By telling her that people send really racy things to the prison all the time, it lets her know that she doesn't have to worry about the normal, every-day kind of pictures she'd be likely to send. If he were angling for dirty pictures, I also don't think he would have followed up with the ""disgusting"" line.

But I totally agree SK framed it in a way that would make us question if that is what Adnan is hinting for. Re the doppleganger photo- there is a thread somewhere about ""magical thinking"" in grief which has an interesting stance on that.

It must be difficult for those involved in this relatively recent case to follow the court proceedings however long ago, listen to Serial (which is edited for time and can only include so much) and watch the weird speculation people like me bring up online. I am conscious of this and hope to be able to discuss various theories - which will inevitably point the finger towards truly innocent people - while meaning no disrespect. It is like living through a Sherlock Holmes story where the characters all have internet access and... Ok, never mind, I have no idea where this comparison is going.

PowerOfYes	3	0	Strangely, I sort of agree with your title but not your actual hypothesis. The fact that no one specifically remembers whether a person they saw regularly at a place they went to regularly on a day that was not unusual at the time actually seems pretty ordinary to me. I think you've overlooked the elephant in the room though: there was a conspiracy of silence **in relation to Jay**. We know at least three other people claimed he told them about the murder on the day it happened: Jenn (who helped him dispose of evidence), Chris and 'neighbour boy'. To me it has always seemed very likely tha Jay told bits of the story, probably with a bunch of lies around the details to his buddies. Even allowing for the possibility that NB was lying about seeing a body, he probably knew something about Jay's involvement before the police found him. Did the police know about Chris' evidence? If so, why was he not a witness?	20141127T165835
anonymous	6	0	Despite what the internet tells you about black helicopters, massive coverups are extremely difficult to keep under wraps. There would be a lot of proof out there and at least one person to blow the whistle.	20141127T134146
redroverster	2	0	Yes, it's an ad for Best Buy.	20141127T170008
mostpeoplearedjs	2	0	No. I'm guessing the track team wasn't called in because Jay himself says Adnan went to track practice. As for the mosque, I suspect there wasn't a specific recall of the exact moment he walked in that night. The Setate's theory doesn't require that he never went to the mosque, and being there doesn't provide a complete alibi. So neither side probably went too deep into it.	20141128T020446
prettikitti89	3	0	You make some interesting points. However, I ran track in high school, and because practice generally involved running a lot, and people didn't run together, I could see how the team wouldn't be able to say if Adnan was there or not. For example, if he's training for the 2 mile run, he would show up to practice and run 2 (or more) miles. And they wouldn't necessarily be running on the track. While some members of my team ran in groups, others preferred to run alone. That being said, there are some weird things about that day.	20141127T134533
anonymous	2	0	I'm not with you on the scope of what you are proposing, however there is clearly pressure on those who knew Adnan to keep their unfavorable views of him, to themselves.	20141127T141126
anonymous	1	0	Why wouldn't they tell people to say Adnan was there, rather than say nothing? Seems like they are as bad at conspiracies as the 9/11 folks.	20141127T161543
wtfsherlock	1	0	No, you can't get the whole community to conspire to not give him an alibi. It wasn't just one community in Woodlawn. The school was primarily black, Adnan's family and the mosque community south Asian. The teachers and coaches are another group. It's not probable you could get these three groups to cooperate to frame a popular high school kid. Your right that there should have been plenty of people at the mosque and track practice to provide alibis, though. The fact there weren't (according to what's been presented on the podcast) implies Adnan wasn't at those locations.	20141127T165605
anonymous	1	0	Very insightful comment re: Jay. It seems strange to me that he isn't just as much a focus as Adnan, as he is such a key figure in the whole situation. However, and here is where my stereotypes may come into play, it may be possible that these people who grew up in a (likely) rough area (relative to what many of us are used to, anyway) are so used to distrusting the police that any kind of cooperation with law enforcement is distasteful to them. People may know something but just be conditioned to be silent.	20141127T195517
xrondacool	4	0	The thing is people are quite reluctant to speak to police anyway so some slight coercion could influence people. My main point would be that these two key events don't seem to have been investigated in depth at all and should have been in order to dispel any doubts	20141127T135817
xrondacool	2	0	Yea I agree it would depend on the logistics of track - basically what I would love to see is some investigation into it to see what the likelihood of him being noticed and by how many people. Or even just getting a list of track people who usually ran track and asked them some questions about that day.	20141127T135558
xrondacool	2	0	It may be a tough undertaking now, 15 years afterwards - but still getting together a list of the track team and a list of people who regularly attended the mosque should not be hugely difficult. The thing is if anybody had the slightest bit of information from these periods of time it would change the case greatly.	20141127T142955
xrondacool	1	0	Well if they got 5 people in and asked them to give a full account of Adnan's movements they would get 5 different versions if he wasn't there. Look at Jay there were multiple different versions of his account and there was only one of him. This would undermine Adnan's case more. People generally would try to avoid getting involved voluntarily if there were threats of repercussions.	20141127T162445
xrondacool	1	0	The thing is I would believe this more if Adnan is made out to be the quiet reposed type of person but by all accounts (he was prom king) he was a charismatic guy, a guy who would be noticed. Also he attended track consistently so then it would be very much noticeable that he missed that day. Some track people must have noticed this. So when these people found out that Hae was missing, they would think of Adnan as they had been dating - the link is not a far stretch by any means. A similar scenario could be said for the mosque albeit many might not know of Adnan and Hae's relationship - still a good portion of Adnan's close friends there would. So he is absent from his consistent routine the day his ex girlfriend goes missing... I think if you would put yourself in the position of those people you would remember something like that. Eyewitnesses do help in a lot of cases and I am not saying they should base a whole case on eyewitnesses but my whole point is if they interviewed these people then they may actually have got some leads that could help with the investigation in what to me is a very important period of time.	20141127T155142
PowerOfYes	1	0	I agree with you. My guess is that he was sharp enough to only tell people who weren't likely to go to the police. And of itself it doesn't indicate guilt, because he didn't confess to the murder to any of them. However each one appears to have gotten a slightly different story. Just curious, I think.	20141127T201541
anonymous	1	0	Investigators must prioritize their time, since it is a limited resource. Spending time on conspiracy theories would likely be low on their list. Of course, I might be getting the wrong idea by your use of the word conspiracy. Maybe at some level there was something of this flavour, even if it was a subconscious manipulation of the community due to Adnan's (or his family's) charisma, standing in the community, etc. But that would also be difficult for investigators to look into, IMO.	20141127T141326
cjw200	3	0	6 weeks later, that's 6 straight weeks of track practices. Do you remember if so and so was at work 6 weeks ago? Plus the cops don't care to try and ask all those people, they have their man it's Adnan who needs the alibi.	20141127T154222
anonymous	0	0	Was your comment intended for me?	20141127T164223
xrondacool	1	0	Maybe conspiracy is not the correct word to use in this case, but more of a coercion. I just think that these two timings are key and from what I can gather nobody was questioned from the track team or the mosque. The investigators relied more on people coming forward or on what some people such as Jay has said rather than proactively doing some investigation.	20141127T142659
xrondacool	1	0	I would argue people could still remember back to that day after 6 weeks as these time periods crystallize in people's minds. Even if you didnt know them very well you would still, after hearing she is missing/brutally murdered think back to that day. If you were at track/mosque that day, noticed Adnan was/wasn't there, then heard his ex girlfriend was missing/murdered the next day/week you would remember. It isn't a stretch for a number of people to put that together. I know if I heard the police were searching for a missing girl that evening, and I was a classmate my first questions would be about her friends/exes and Adnan would surely come to mind.	20141127T161558

Additionally, I am white and when I was a teenager, I had not had any negative/scary dealings with the police. Jay was a black teenage male, with a number of bad experiences with the police, with seemingly no supportive parents.	20141127T171829
Hopper80	6	0	Yes. The nightmare that the victim's family is going through, the torture of that not knowing, would see to it. Plus, you know, there's a calculating, hands-on violent murderer around. There I was, thinking 'I'm going to kill the bitch' (however many times I was actually told it) wasn't literal, and it was. Jay apparently told quite a few people, but didn't see fit to go to the cops. Nor did the people he told - Jenn being way more involved/sure of the matter than Chris. When that 'the bitch is dead. Come get me' call came through, I'd be straight onto the police, tell them to get to wherever Adnan was expecting/waiting to be picked up from. He's there, with the still-warm body of his strangled ex-girlfriend in the boot.	20141127T145242

This then firmed up into a weird narcissistic fantasy about him being Adnan's accomplice and helping to dispose of the body, which he told Jenn to big himself up. When the police talked to Jenn, Jay found himself trapped in his own lies and just decided to run with it. It does depend on someone else having killed Hae, and its thin, but I'm not sure it's any less convincing than the case for the prosecution.	20141127T175256

mostpeoplearedjs	2	0	"Hair examination doesn't provide an exact match to the certain exclusion of all others, but a ""match"" or finding of association is a strong indicator the questioned hair came from the known sample. It's not absolute because hair characteristics are not a truly unique signature like a fingerprint or DNA, but can be reliably matched to individuals with very good (but not perfect) accuracy. It's a lot more precise than just establishing which broad racial group the hair came from (as in, reliably but not perfectly matching hairs to specific people, not just their race). The article says that kind of conclusion is phrased this way: “The questioned hair exhibits the same microscopic characteristics as the hairs in the known hair sample, and accordingly, the questioned hair is consistent with originating from the same source as the known sample.” It's pretty clear from both briefs that the hair analysis did not yield that kind of match to Adnan's hair. But did it exclude Adnan as the source? The article says a true exclusion is usually phrased this way: “the questioned hair is microscopically dissimilar to hairs in the known hair sample and therefore could not have come from the donor of the known hair sample.” The article I linked says this is typically how a ""no conclusion"" is phrased: ""The questioned hair exhibits similarities and slight microscopic differences, and therefore, no conclusion can be reached as to whether or not the questioned hair is consistent with originating from the donor of the known hair sample.” A ""no conclusion"" means the hair may or may not have come from the suspect. There are a variety of reasons why the examiner may not be able to make a conclusion: Some possible causes for these slight differences are (1) a significant amount of time has occurred between the deposition of the questioned hair and the collection of the known sample (typically more than one year); (2) the questioned hair is significantly longer (or shorter) than the hairs in the known head-hair sample (for example, the donor of the known sample may have cut his or her hair after deposition of the questioned hair); (3) the questioned hair has not been artificially treated, but the known sample has been; (4) the questioned hair is not a full-length hair; that is, a portion(s) of the hair is/are missing; (5) the known sample contains too few hairs for an adequate comparison; and (6) the questioned hair comes from a different donor. If the hair evidence is really an exclusion I think that's a lot stronger evidence for the defense than a ""no conclusion."" I wish I knew which one it was. Edit: Really, really dumb question: under hair analysis, would a Pakistani like Adnan be ""Asian"" or ""Caucasian?"" I've never used the ""three race"" hair construct so I don't know where South Asians fit. I know Pakistan is part of ""Asia"" but I can't say whether I would regard Pakistani hair as closer to Southeast Asians or Middle Easterners. I've just never tried to make that lumping exercise."	20141128T180258
serialmonotony	4	0	Who is everybody else though? Presumably the only other possible suspects they considered at the time were Jay and Mr.S, both of whom had self-admittedly been there with the body at the burial site - one burying her and the other discovering her - so a match to them wouldn't prove or disclose anything.	20141127T174013
mostpeoplearedjs	1	0	"Well, first it depends on if the hair analysis excludes Adnan or not. If it doesn't that means there's probably not anywhere else to go with the hair-it might be Adnan's, might not, it's too short or degraded or whatever to determine. If it's an exclusion, though, it should be tested against anybody and everybody else. Since the hair was broadly similar to Adnan's, I'm assuming that means it couldn't be Jay's (as he's of a different ""race"" as that term is defined in hair analysis). Is Mr. S black? If so, the above would apply to him as well. I think excluding (if that's the case) the three people believed to have been around the body in Leakin Park would be it's own kind of evidence - perhaps innocently explained by the hair having been transferred sometime before the crime, or perhaps proof of the presence of a third person with hair similar but not exactly the same as Adnan's."	20141128T181102

serialmonotony	7	0	Ahhh... so this explains this previously much discussed part... the part in the podcast when we hear the taped interview with Jay about his role in the burying of the body: **Jay**: 'He asked me if was gonna help, and I told him 'fuck no', and he starts shoveling dirt on top of her' **MacGillivary**: 'Let me stop a minute' **Jay**: 'Yes' **MacGillivary**: 'You helped him dig the hole?' **Jay**: 'Yes' So Jay has actually said a few sentences before this that the hole was dug (but hadn't clarified who'd dug it), and his 'fuck no' was his response to Adnan asking if he was going to help shovel dirt on top of Hae's body, after (Jay says) Adnan had just placed her in the hole.	20141127T204227
Cabin11	16	0	This, unfortunately, makes Jay's first lie about the trunk pop seem understandable. If there are cameras at Best Buy (supposed actual site) he would be correct in worrying about them. He would be seen, at the very least, rendezvousing with Adnan, and possibly observing the alleged body in the trunk. So he says the trunk pop happens somewhere unverifiable at first. But by the next interview, he is in too deep and knows that they are really after Adnan. So he has less to lose by telling them the actual spot. Not saying Jay is innocent of anything, but I get why he would lie. Does this make sense to anyone? It also gives me a bad feeling that Jay owed Adnan money.	20141127T194053

And also did he mean Don or another older boyfriend? Also weird for Adnan to be using the same boyfriend logic that would make him seem suspicious. If Adnan didn't say this, interesting that Jay would fabricate it--it sounds more like the kind of framing Jay might be doing ""check with her old boyfriend""!

Jay did the right thing here: a) he came clean, at least in part. b) he is contrite, remorseful. Given that he is only 19 (still a kid, really), if the detectives are older 40-somethings, they would see that he was pulled in by Adnan, roped in, and Jay wasn't able to get out of it. He says as much, and wishes he had stopped it, just that he didn't believe Adnan was serious. He came clean without a deal in exchange. Adnan was asking him to stay quiet, but he decided to tell the detectives what happened. That is the wise thing to do. Otherwise, he would be locked up as well today.	20141128T054608

But this idea doesn't line up with how Hae's diary says she loves her new bf so much... And that doesn't really explain the shoes, unless she was planning to climb into the backseat through the car without stepping outside (it doesn't seem like someone would want to step on the cold and/or snowy ground with no shoes)...

Hopper80	31	0	The cameras would see Adnan murder Hae, Adnan walk to the phone to call Jay, Adnan wait by the car as Jay comes to meet him, the trunk pop, etc. The cameras would bear out his version of events. The only reason I can think to be concerned about cameras is if what they recorded went against what you'd said.	20141127T202615
dev1anter	12	0	Nope. Jenn said best buy on 27th and Jay said Edmonton on 28th if I remember correctly . Then they talked to each other for sure because he changed it to best buy the next time inventing a stupid excuse. Although he proceeds to lie again. Here's the timeline Places Where Adnan Showed Hae’s Body to Jay: >1.At Edmondson Avenue (Jay’s First Interview). >2.At the Best Buy (Jay’s Second Interview). >3.Never, Jay was with Adnan when he killed her (Jay’s Third Interview). >4.At Franklintown Road (Brief of Appellant at 12) (Detective MacGillivary testified “that [Jay] told him that [Adnan] showed him Hae’s bodyin the trunk on Franklintown Road”). >5.At a pool hall in Catonsville (Episode 8) (“[Jay] was shooting pool, Adnan called him he was like ‘yo, I gotta talk to you,’ and he was like ‘yo I’m busy.’ ‘Yo, where are you’ and he told him where he was. Adnan showed up and he’s like ‘oh I gotta talk to you’ and he’s like– this was a little tug of war for a while and Adnan eventually convinced him to come outside with him and his car or, I.”) >6.When the body was in the trunk of Hae’s car (Trial Testimony). >7.When the body was in the back of a truck (Trial Testimony) (referencing prior statements to police). Choose which one you like!	20141127T202556
anonymous	11	0	I find it really hard to find any of his lies he's actually been caught in anything but completely understandable. He's trying to minimize his involvement and protect his friends. On a related note, Rabia did a *really* bad job of redacting names, especially of names of people who did not want their names shared.	20141127T194710
Ratava	23	0	"What she was saying was that the ""spine"" of his story doesn't shift much. Adnan tells Jay he's going to kill Hae -> Adnan kills Hae and calls Jay to pick him up -> he shows him the body in the trunk -> they leave the body and the car and come back later -> they bury the body that night. And she's right -- that all stays consistent. It's just that DETAILS change, but the SPINE stays."	20141128T003345

in_some_knee_yak	11	0	We've always known Jay's story changes somewhat over the interviews. I don't think there is anything really new in Rabia's post that pushes me more towards one conclusion. What did that for you exactly?	20141128T015006
ShastaTampon	4	0	"You should feel silly. To be resentful of ""the way we've been slowly and calculatedly served up ""{facts}"" about this crime,"" as presented by a PODCAST called SERIAL whose sole intention is to tell a week by week story is silly. Frustrated, yes. As we all are. Hence the beauty of the work the Serial team has done so far. As for anything being OBVIOUS; the popularity of this podcast and the spin offs it has created, like this back and forth of text that you and I are serving up here, it's close to obvious that nothing is obvious when it comes to this case. Jay lies, or is coerced into lying, or telling half truths. Adnan has been lying all along, or he hasn't, or has been telling half truths. There is a third party, or a serial killer, or Hae killed herself. What about anything that you've heard is OBVIOUS? Please tell me you are being sarcastic and not using hyperbole or that you have some ulterior motive for thinking this way. Otherwise you are falling under the same confirmation bias that the jurors were when they convicted Adnan. You're just using it in the opposite fashion. In fact worse. You're accusing someone of whom the state did not even prosecute. What you're positing about this case as has been presented so far is irresponsible. Yet another point of this podcast. To shed light on the fallibility of jurors, detectives, prosecutors, the defense, the criminal justice system, the malleability of memory, and how much can one really know another just by hearing them talk. Not that I don't value what you have to say, but dial down the hyperbole."	20141128T100536
anonymous	34	0	Lol, I feel exactly the opposite. The more I read the more I realize that Adnan did it and feel silly for having gone the rabbit hole of wondering if he was wrongly convicted.	20141127T204336
anonymous	12	0	"I'm interested to see why you and people with the same opinion as you feel this way. Do people in the ""Jay did it"" camp have an explanation for why he would kill Hae? Personally, my inability to think of a motive is what keeps me from being sure Jay is guilty."	20141127T210056
asha24	7	0	Yeah and since the caller knew Yasser I always assumed the caller was one of Adnan's Muslim friends, so it did not occur to me that the caller could have also been connected to Jay.	20141127T225359

Anoraklibrarian	2	0	Why do you think he 'came clean without a deal in exchange?' Given the numerous hours of Jay+detectives talking to each other beforehand and the way they are leading and coaching him along, I would be hard pressed to think that a deal had not already been made.

anonymous	11	0	"She didn't know that Hae and Adnan were a couple because they had to keep it a secret from their families. Both Adnan and Hae were not allowed to be in this relationship together and that's totally understandable all of their friends (Yaser was a male friend who Adnan would have most likely told) testified to this. Also it doesn't really matter if she knew that they were dating at the time or not. Second of all they are from a more conservative culture. Adnan would not be speaking to a woman about Hae. I don't think that she meant it in a condescending way. What she meant was that everyone who hung out with Jay was hanging out with him to smoke pot aka ""up to no good""."	20141127T205111

Stop attacking her character. She's not doing anything wrong. She believes in Adnan's innocence and just because you do not agree with her or SK does not mean you have to attack them as people.

Hopper80	8	0	Do I recall right that there was a snow day on the 14th and 15th? Would 'light freezing rain' be enough to declare a snow day? I live in the UK. The nearest weather station isn't all that far away, but what it records can be quite different from how things are in my town - is it possible, wherever the weather was being recorded, it wasn't all that local to where this was going on?	20141127T201434

asha24	3	0	Right but it takes time for snow to gather on the ground for there to be enough to have a snow ball fight. And school was closed because of an ice storm, I think if what Jay and Stephanie are saying is true, then it's more reasonable for Asia to have mixed up the terms.	20141127T212028

I am not at all surprisd her shoes were off. They could easily have come off while kicking (as was related by Adnan to Jay)-while being strangled she'd kick as hard as she could. Or they could have come off while he was shoving the body from the front to the trunk.	20141128T214022

As soon as he was arrested, she was out defending this kid she thought she knew... but she had no idea he was sinnin' and smokin' and being american.

Similarly to how some Fergusonians automatically assumed that Brown was an outstanding keed who din du nuffin, even though evidence shows otherwise. >What she meant was that everyone who hung out with Jay was hanging out with him to smoke pot aka ""up to no good"". associating marijuana consumption to being ""up to no good"" is kinda part of what I meant by being condecending.

PowerOfYes	33	0	While we banned the use of surnames on this subreddit out of deference to the podcast, we can't control the entire internet. Since these are public records, I don't see any reason to ban mention of them. We would like users to continue to respect our rules of naming people consistent with the Serial podcast's approach, even though we realise further details are a click away. We try and avoid the sub becoming host to a lynch mob bent on doxxing every person, sharing and dissecting details to the nth degree. There is no doubt, a fine line. We'd like to do our best to prevent people mentioned in the podcast (including Jay or Jenn) being harassed or approached as a result of anything shared on here. We're also wary of people jumping to conclusions that may be wrong, hurtful or defamatory. Healthy discussion and speculation, 'what ifs', challenging assumptions and expressing disbelief or doubt are fine. The administration of justice in relation to crimes is carried out in public and public discussion and debate about these matters is necessary and useful. Thank you.	20141127T203715

anonymous	6	0	He says that he was concerned about cameras. I think that in all likelihood he, or someone he cares about, was present when Adnan strangled Hae, and he doesn't want to admit that.

peetnice	2	0	Yes, if we hypothesize about why he might be concerned about cameras, either for altruistic or nefarious reasons, then it makes more sense. But in any of those scenarios, the bottom line is that they discredit the story(/stories) he gave the police, and his excuse about minimizing involvement makes no sense in the context of his taped account.

anonymous	12	0	I think this is a special case. This is the most popular podcast *in the world* right now. The amount of focus on this case is intense. There's a distinct potential for angry mobs. In this context, you could argue that broadcasting people's names to the wider public (even if the names are technically already accessible) actually puts them in an unreasonable amount of danger.	20141127T220208

anonymous	1	0	I think that's a little outlandish, I really do. I agree that Rabia should have done a better job of hiding people's names but what's done is done. Also if anyone really wanted to hurt any of the people involved with this case would mostly likely be Jay or Jen and their info is already all out there. Second of all if someone wanted to hurt someone from this case they would not need Rabia to give them the names since they could request the court documents themselves. I highly doubt that is going to happen though.	20141128T015915

anonymous	10	0	What's your beef with Rabia? I am really unsure of whether or not Adnan is guilty or not but to me it seems that she really believes that he's innocent and she's backing up her theory with evidence. Everything that she's presented so far is not some outlandish s*it that she's made up. She feels like he got the short end of the stick and she's adamant about helping him. Lay off her and yes, she is doing this for her crusade for Adnan and she has every right to. I agree she could have done a better job but I totally understand her slip-ups. These are documents that she has been peering over for years. She made a mistake.	20141127T211507

Remember to file a police report for each use - law enforcement will only act on the trace once a formal police report is filed in regard to the call. >__Malicious caller identification__ facility, also called __malicious call trace__ or __caller activated malicious call trace__, when subscribed or enabled, works by allowing a phone call recipient to mark or flag the preceding phone call connection as malicious (i.e. harassing, threatening, obscene, etc.) The phone system will then automatically trace the call by flagging station to station billing and routing data including start and end times. The call trace is not dependent upon call duration (as envisioned in dramatic movie plots) and will record all meta-data regardless of source conditions - even if the call was made from a [silent number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_number), payphone or a number with caller identification disabled. To protect privacy the resulting trace data is only made available to law enforcement. >How the user activates this feature depends on their phone system — generally it is either in-band-signaling [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTMF) sequence such as the [*57](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*57) [Vertical service code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_service_code) or a special button attached to their phone generating an out-of-band signal. For analogue services, many exchanges will interpret DTMF sequences to activate [POTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service). Digital services, such as [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN) or [GSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM), enable the [CPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-premises_equipment) to activate MCI via out-of-band signaling. Often with [PABXs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PABX) with analogue phone connections, the PABX will interpret the DTMF and then activate the out-of-band signaling. > --- ^Interesting: [^Prank ^call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank_call) ^| [^Signalling ^System ^No. ^7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7) ^| [^Vertical ^service ^code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_service_code) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmflspn) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cmflspn)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)	20141128T220416

phat59	38	0	On page 28 of Jays statement he mentions that the windshield wiper switch next to the steering wheel broke off while Hae was being strangled. Is it likely that Adnan would have given Jay such a specific detail? Or is it more likely that Jay was present during the strangulation? Seems strange that Adnan would have told Jay so much about the interior details of the car.	20141127T221752
Kicking-it-per-se	16	0	So in Jay's 1st statement to the police he says Adnan threatens Jay by saying Adnan knows a West Baltimore hitman?! This seems either like a really weird lie or if it's true then why wouldn't Adnan use the hitman on Hae?	20141127T204058
Sweet-Red	5	0	On page 100, Jay mentions that he was with Adnan when he spoke to police officers (as well as Hae's family). Here's the actual wording: **Macgillivary** *Okay do you recal what kind of statements he made to the police?* **Jay** *Um, I knew them to be totally false, he told them he had no knowledge of where she was. Um, he gave them other people's name to try to look for her and told him that was her personality.* I wonder if there is any record of the police's side of that conversation? Would be interesting to hear how closely the two sides match	20141128T011002

And also did he mean Don or another older boyfriend? Also weird for Adnan to be using the same boyfriend logic that would make him seem suspicious. If Adnan didn't say this, interesting that Jay would fabricate it--it sounds more like the kind of framing Jay might be doing ""check with her old boyfriend""!"	20141128T115205

posalootly	1	0	During trauma, there are often very specific details that get stuck in your head that you can't shake -- a stray hair on someone's jacket that you get transfixed on, or the shape of a cloud, or something dumb that seems so stupid compared to the severity of the moment in front of you.

wheatbix	0	0	Seems to be some inconsistency here about whether it was the windshield wiper switch or the turn signal. If it was the turn signal, I would think anyone who had subsequently driven the car would remember that and not confuse it with the windshield wiper lever.

GauchoBearBulldog	1	0	In the transcript, Jay says he smoked a cigarette while sitting on a log while Adnan was burying Hae. But in the [evidence map that we have](http://hw4.serialpodcast.org/sites/default/files/maps/evidence_map_notes.jpg) there was no cigarette found. It's possible - even likely - that Jay would have pocketed the cigarette after smoking it, so as to not leave DNA-linked evidence near the burial site. But it seems like a detail that he included to exculpate himself from direct involvement of disposing of the body, and one which could have easily been followed up on by one of the questioning detectives, but wasn't, and could have even been verified after a thorough survey of the area surrounding the burial site. In any even, if he did pocket it, the cigarette would have been disposed in the dumpster (or trash) with the rest of Jay's clothes later that night or the next day.	20141128T145028
fn0000rd	1	0	If you were picturing something happening in the woods, it would be perfectly cromulent to assume there would be a log to sit on. I'm not saying that I believe one way or the other, I'm just saying that either case could be true, so I have to discard them both.	20141130T220431
GauchoBearBulldog	1	0	Yes, but it was during Ramadan and Adnan would have had been fasting so there would not have been much to his vomit. According to Jay's testimony, they would have already been to McDonald's, but it isn't clear if Adnan supposedly ate anything.	20141128T150240
whydontyouaskher	1	0	"In a later statement Jay is asked to confirm that he said ""new"" boyfriend in the pre-interview and he agrees, so I think he just misspoke when he said old.

mistajee33	2	0	His story is always modified to put more blame on Adnan. In the first incident, Adnan coming up with the whole idea of burying Hae in Leakin Park is the right way to spin it; in the second instance, the truth is told because Adnan needing Jay to find the spot makes Adnan look more guilty. My theory is that Jay was HEAVILY involved in the cover-up (and took charge of the situation), was forced into testifying to save himself, and in doing so must try to incriminate Adnan as much as possible. This is where his inconsistencies stem from. (Disclaimer: All speculation)	20141128T152727

jamesneysmith	12	0	Couldn't the rocks have simply been placed there to offer better cover than the shallow layer of dirt provided?	20141127T211841
partymuffell	9	0	First, Jay gives the cops a detailed description of the burial site and of the position of Hae's body in the shallow grave that strongly suggests he was present at the burial. Second, why would Jay implicate himself in a crime if he wasn't even there? Third, Jay explicitly told the cops Adnan intended to revisit the site but Jay refused. So it's not unlikely that Adnan went, found the body had been partly disinterred by animals, and piled the rocks on it to cover it. (Could Mr S have witnessed the scene?) Fourth, our lay opinions about forensics are quite unreliable. We should always let the experts draw conclusions from forensic findings---just watch the documentary *West of Memphis* to get an idea of how our lay forensic intuitions are unreliable.	20141128T011510

WaitForSpring	6	0	Given what we recently learned about The Blair Witch Project and its sequel being filmed in Patapsco and Leakin, my main thought is about the damn rock piles in the movie. Obviously, there is a connection. ...On a more for-real note, the fact that this is left out of other testimony is suspicious. And I wouldn't necessarily put it out of possibility for a first time killer, since it just as easily could have been done with 'digging into frozen ground is difficult, oh shit, what else can I use to cover the body that won't blow/wash away?' as an intention, not directly to avoid animal disturbance.	20141127T204844
div2n	2	0	Depending on how large they are it would indicate there were at least two involved in the burial. It had been speculated by many pro Adnan folks that Jay did it on his own or an unknown third party did it and Jay was just lying all the way through. Knowing the size of those rocks would be a pretty important piece of information to limit the possibilities.	20141128T145818
monikerdelight	2	0	I think many people are looking too far into this. The description of the rocks on the body does not say that the entire body was covered with rocks. And we know in trial there was that man who was looking for the body himself after it had been discovered and could hardly see it. So I don't think the gravesite was totally covered in rocks...that would have made it stand out against the surroundings.	20141128T231627
FriedGold32	3	0	Think how dark it would have been in those woods. Yet they've gone searching in the pitch black for rocks large enough to cover up a body and Jay has not mentioned this at all? I've posted before about this. I don't think Jay was present at the burial of the body.	20141127T210428
whitenoise2323	1	0	"The thing that puzzles me even more is that nobody after the fact notices rocks. Mr. S never mentioned rocks, it seems rocks would have helped him in noticing the body or at least drawn his attention to that area. SK doesn't mention rocks when looking at photos of the crime scene. ""We opened a packet of photos together. Some of them were awful to see as you’d imagine. There was one where you could make out a bit of black hair amid dirt and leaves."" The surveyor, Buddemeyer, didn't mention any rocks. He said the gravesite ""just blended in with the natural surroundings of the ground."" Rabia says that this document is the first she's heard of any rocks. It seems very strange."	20141201T192256
anonymous	1	0	I think that if rocks were placed on top of the body so that animals didn't carry it away is a strong indication that someone was probably thinking about moving the body? Perhaps they just didn't get to it in time before the body was discovered. I don't know what this means to the case or if it is significant at all.	20141127T210955
ChariBari	-3	0	An indication that Jay was not involved in the murder? Surprise, surprise.	20141127T194851
anonymous	1	0	Yes it is. Jay says words to the effect of oh, by the way, Adnan asked me to take him back to Leakin park to check on stuff, and I told him no (Adnan has a car and Jay doesn't. Why would he need to 'ask' him!?). This to me hints that someone, at least, went back because they were worried about the burial. Jay also admits going back to check on the car: Ritz: The area where Adnan parked the car and got all the things out of it, had you gone back to that location to see if the car was still there? Jay: I was... during the commute I made an effort, yeah out of my way to see if it was still there, yeah it was. Ritz: When was the last time that you went out of your way to see if the car was still there? Jay: Four days ago, so the 24th. Ritz: ... was the car still there? Jay: Yes. Ritz: Does he have keys to that vehicle? Jay: No. Ritz: What did he do with the keys? Jay: He put those in the dumpster also. Ritz: How do you know that? Jay: I saw them.	20141208T015017

So what Jay is claiming here seems to be that in a conversation days or weeks after the murder, Adnan (who has a car) showed up to his job and asked Jay (who doesn't have a car) to take him back to the burial site. What the shit? This seems baldly fictional.

Wherever I read this said that no other reports mentions these rocks. But is this statement by Jay intended to address the rocks perhaps? In that, cops know there were rocks which it would seem were added to the grave at a later date then the initial burial, and this is Jay telegraphing that information, implying Adnan went back to the grave after Jay refused to go back with him?	20141128T123421

bitofastate	1	0	Trouble we have in no context, however this was addressed by SK in ep 6 and it's clear that Aisha and Krista was doing the pinging and the friends group was talking about that. What you can see from the call log is that Adnan does not page anyone in the two days, small sample I know but outside of the ep 2 bit where they would page one another (who paged who?) to set up the call what do we actually know about how often they paged after the breakup. Maybe one thing that would stick is why call someone three times to give them your new cell number when you are planning to off them the following day? Isn't that even odder? If it's to cover your tracks then you would surely have the sense to lay an electronic trail later and page her?	20141128T161706
anonymous	1	0	I'm commenting late, but here's two of my theories. 1) The police never checked the logs of Hae's pager. We cannot not for sure that Adnan didn't page her from another source, we only know he never used his cell phone to contact her. He also couldn't have called her at home because then her parents would find out about their previous relationship. Also, who calls the home of someone who's been reported missing? 2) This is speculation on my part, but it's possible that during their last conversation the night before, Hae might have asked Adnan to stop contacting her. Maybe things were going well with Don, maybe Don was getting jealous, maybe Adnan was being clingy, maybe her parents were getting suspicious. For whatever reason she might have told him to back off for a bit.	20141129T010602

You could also interpret it as distancing himself simply because he's a Muslim, the police are involved and neither family new of the illicit relationship. It's perfectly feasible that an innocent Adnan would be worried about Hae's parents finding out and getting her in even more trouble.

And they're not wrong, I know I grew up in a prep school bubble, but I imagine that Hae lived a somewhat similar existence and that it would be a big deal for a girl to just disappear. Ugh, IDK, but I've never been able to parse that. How could people not be freaking out?"	20141128T003744

This is why there's often a battle between defence and prosecution to get the gender balance they want, why death row is stuffed with men and the stats that prove women are more likely to vote democrat. I still think reading anything into the lack of calls is a mistake. Twist the viewpoint round and take Adnan's perspective. Assume that he's just murdered and buried his ex and is now on a mission to get away with his crime. Everyone else is calling Hae to see if she's OK. Does the clearly intelligent Adnan think ""I won't bother as I know she's lying dead in Leakin Park"" or does he think ""maybe I should call her too so as not to arouse suspicion""? There's lots of evidence of Jay making efforts to cover his tracks and yet dopey Adnan seems to have made none. The fact that he made no calls to her after she went missing is just that ""a fact"" It's not evidence of anything."	20141129T005917
The_Chairman_Meow	1	0	"> However there are clear and differing patterns of thinking and behaviour between the genders No actually, there isn't. Read some feminist literature before you assume men are from Mars, women are from Venus is anything more than market research pseudo-science. There isn't ""clear and differing patterns of behavior"" between sexes. The very very broad indications of difference is influenced by society. Women are more likely to vote democrat because democrats are more likely to support sex equality and reproductive rights, not because their lady brains make them more liberal. Men are more likely to commit violent crimes because patriarchal societies influence violence, not because man brain make man smash. >The fact that he made no calls to her after she went missing is just that ""a fact"" It's not evidence of anything. You're right. It isn't evidence of anything because we can't read Adnan's mind. But if Adnan assumed Hae was just missing, it makes zero sense that he wouldn't try to call her, male or not. Especially considering the context that he called her the night before. Adnan is close enough to Hae for him to give her his phone number, but not close enough to page her while she was missing? It makes no sense."	20141129T013733

8shadesofgray	2	0	There could of course be a lot of potential reasons. One is that she knows exactly how many shovels there were but reiterates that she doesn't in order to a) protect Jay (as in she knows that Jay helped with the burial but is indicating to the cops he didn't) or b) protect herself (as in she played a bigger role in cleaning and disposing of the shovels than she is copping too).	20141128T054734

mostpeoplearedjs	1	0	I'm sure it varies. In my jurisdiction it wouldn't be unusual for police to speak to a witness without having them write a handwritten statement.

I_W_N_R	13	0	Seems plausible.

brazenbunny	13	0	I'm decidedly undecided about Adnan's guilt or innocence at this point, but I feel like those of you who instantly discredit the butt dial theory are too young to remember how easy it was to butt dial on those old phones.

anonymous	12	0	I think this sounds pretty legit. So far, I've seen this post, and a couple of other plausible explanations as to how the call could have lasted 2 minutes without anyone talking to Jay.

Wouldn't eventually there be a recording saying something to the effect of ""the party you're trying to reach is not answering the phone, please hang up and try later""? I know I've heard this before, however, I can't be certain if you were automatically disconnected or it allowed you to stay on the phone and let it keep ringing.

There's just as much evidence that Adnan called Nisha (Jay says that) as Adnan didn't call Nisha (Adnan says this). We have seen Jay change his story over and over. We've seen Adnan change one aspect of his story (the asking Hae for a ride thing). We don't have to believe Adnan any more than we believe Jay if you don't want to. If we are going off evidence, then we don't know who made the Nisha call.	20141129T020343
anonymous	2	0	That's right there are inconsistencies about this call/episode. My problem is that people conclude that it is *most likely* that it was a butt-dial, when a butt-dial is not a *likely* occurrence at any given time. There are other possible explanations which may be more *likely* than a butt-dial: (1) Nisha does not have complete recall about this incident, (2) Nisha is not telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth.	20141128T211203

And he basically well Adnan walked in with his cell phone and then like, he told me to speak with Jay and I was like ""ok"" cause Jay wanted to say hi and so I said hi to Jay. And that’s all I can really recall. > Prosecutor: What time of day did that occur? (etc) That hardly seems to be speaking to Jay's benefit - it's been clearly established that Jay started working at that store *weeks* after the murder. So if Nisha's memory of talking to Jay happened when he was at that job, it makes it hard to believe that the Jay&Adnan call happened the day of the murder. Now, maybe Adnan *did* call her from the car after killing Hae. But Jay said that the call to Nisha that day was the call where he and Adnan both spoke to her, and we know that isn't true."	20141128T205047

And, he basically well Adnan walked in with his cell phone and then like- he told me to speak with Jay and I was like ‘okay’ cause Jay wanted to say hi so I said hi to Jay. And that’s all I can really recall. Prosecutor Kevin Urick - What time of day did that occur?..."	20141128T070307

skeytwo	16	0	I actually thought the same thing. If they both said this on their own, it's possible that's what Adnan told them. Adnan lying about where the car is is quite incriminating in my opinion. If he told Hae that Jay had his car, she may have just told him to get Jay to pick him up then. Adnan giving his car to Jay, then lying to Hae about where it is, then lying that he didn't ask for a ride looks pretty bad for him.	20141127T230051

(ep2) On the balance he probably did ask. However he may have said this to Jay when he lent him his car, that he'd ask Hae for a ride to somewhere after school but before track. Jay could have woven that into his story as he knew that Adnan had asked Hae for a ride. The point here is that it can be true that Adnan asked, but also that it only tells us he asked, not that he was in Hae's car and not that Jay's reason for why he asked is true.	20141128T160301

carolinaonmymind2004	9	0	Loved reading this blog. One thing I can't get past is that Adnan just didn't remember letting Jay borrow his phone/car again that night. I am wondering if it is possible that Jay had his phone (maybe even car) without Adnan knowing. Remember it is 1999 and people just didn't carry their phones around everywhere and likely taking calls at Mosque would be frowned upon. Maybe he left it in the car (same as why it was left in his car during school) and Jay snagged it after Adnan left for the Mosque. Not sure how it got back to Adnan or his car or whether Jay had the car as well. All the phone calls during that time (as the blog notes) points to the phone being in Jay's possession. I just can't wrap my brain around how that happens without Adnan remembering it.	20141128T164132

Ojisan1	12	0	I really like this timeline and explanation. I have been suspicious of Jay since episode 1. However, the one thing lacking in any Jay theory is motive. He certainly had the means and opportunity, but has anyone proposed a plausible motive for Jay to murder Hae? What would he even have been doing meeting up with Hae that day? The timeline here definitely supports a Jay theory, but I am still not convinced due to a lack of compelling motive. That being said, Adnan's motive positioned by the prosecution is less than satisfactory. It fits their theory of the case, but it isn't very compelling, based on the testimony of their friends that Adnan was basically over the breakup, and was already dating other girls. A strong timeline but there's still critical information that would be needed to either prove Jay did it, or to put enough doubt into the prosecution's case to revisit Adnan's conviction. Personally I think Jay must have done it, or at least have been implicated in it, and that it was likely not Adnan. But I cannot explain *why* Jay would have done it, and that's a big problem for me to be completely convinced.	20141128T073141
bluueit12	3	0	> I think it was Jay- with Jenn helping him. I've been saying this for a few weeks now but he or she makes an awesome point that I think a lot of us never noticed.

anonymous	2	0	Some questions I'd like answered: Was the 3:32 call to her landline home number? If so, what time did Nisha get out of school, did she have after-school activities, did she have a job, etc. My reason for asking is, I want to learn if it was likely that she was at home to field that call. Additionally, does she have siblings or family that would have normally been home during that time?	20141128T155142
kjl85	2	0	This is great. One thing I think is missing is that the calls to Jenn's pager from near the park and ride are assumed to not contain information about where to be picked up, but pager coffee could have been used to say exactly where he wanted to be picked up. This might account for the two pages back to back (i.e., ask the information didn't fit in one page).	20141128T182540

There are a number of issues people have pointed out, such as what you might conclude from this: >This call is likely a good example of the tower data not guaranteeing that a call was made/received from the area typically covered by the the tower/antenna it ends up being routed through. There is no reason for the 12:07 p.m. call to have been made in the shaded territory — it doesn’t fit any narratives, and no other calls are ever routed through L668. The most likely explanation is that the call was made within the territory typically covered by the tower directly to the west of L668, which is L651 – the Woodlawn tower.	20141128T000908
mrmiffster	2	0	Agreed this is the best analysis I've seen so far. This should be required reading on the sub. No doubt in my mind now that Jay did it and Jenn knew more than she let on.	20141128T092706

glammer17	19	0	Yes, this post is incredible - and written by a lawyer so seemingly very valid. Before reading- I just couldn't put the pieces together without thinking it had to be Adnan. However after reading the post, I am now much more on the Innocence page. It really nails the timeline beautifully and I just find Jen's lies extremely incriminating. Not to mention Jay's magically changing story time after time. The only thing that really puzzles me still is Adnan saying he had his cell while at mosque. For this to all really ring true- he had to have been so high that he forgot leaving or giving his phone/car out to Jay one last time, which could make sense if Jay was driving bc Adnan couldn't. How Jay then returned the car and phone, etc- I can't explain that. But I still feel very strongly that this is the best representation of the timeline that I've seen.	20141128T000134

Ojisan1	6	0	">The story he tells to the police that he is scared someone will out his marijuana selling, when that is one of the first things he tells the police about himself, is ridiculous. Absolutely. I don't believe that narrative for a second. I think it is likely that Jay did it on his own, but without knowing why, it's still a mystery. There is some huge fact which would make the whole thing make sense, which is a fact we will never know. What was going on in Jay's head on the afternoon Hae was killed. I don't even understand what Jay could have possibly even been doing that brought him into contact with Hae that day, and yet based on everything, I still think he did it. But I could not at this point say ""Jay should be in jail"" because without knowing why, the whole story still makes no sense. Even with this timeline that makes perfect sense, fits the cell phone data and the multiple conflicting stories that Jay and Jenn told, it just doesn't make sense that Jay would be with Hae on the afternoon she died, and it doesn't make sense why he would kill her. Everything *after that* in OP's theory here makes sense. The one huge missing piece is what could possibly have driven Jay to murder. It was cold blooded. There's no evidence of a fight, or an argument, or a secret liaison, or even much of any connection whatsoever between Jay and Hae. So what would have caused them to be together on that afternoon in the first place, and then caused him to decide to end her life? We may never know."	20141128T142423

ackdoc	9	0	One thing to remember is, from the time of the murder until his arrest and trial, an innocent Adnan probably didn't suspect Jay himself. He was with Jay several times that day, and knew Jay, and maybe didn't think of him as a murderer. Plus, he didn't testify, so there was no platform to scream from. Since then, if Adnan is blaming Jay, is furious with Jay, then this is a part of the narrative that SK is controlling. She might be saving some of that tape for us to hear later.	20141128T145619
Ojisan1	1	0	I have no answer for that. Maybe he somehow was implicated in the murder and figures it's better that only one of them goes to prison rather than both of them. Or maybe he just really was so blindsided by being framed and stitched up for the murder that he never really had a moment when he was in a place to confront Jay's story head-on. Or maybe he's just not that bright, socially, despite how intelligent he seems he just didn't at the time of the trial understand how he was being perceived, how the system is designed to convict *someone*, even if it's the wrong someone, and how he could have changed the perception of him, or how he might have pushed it off onto Jay or anyone else. If Adnan didn't do it, which I don't think he did but cannot prove he didn't, then the second biggest tragedy here, after the primary tragedy of Hae's murder itself, is Adnan's lack of competent defense (his own defense of himself, and his attorney's presentation of an alternate theory to the jury in order to create reasonable doubt, such to avoid the eventual conviction).	20141128T143334
Ojisan1	8	0	But that seems as thin of a reason to commit a murder as Adnan's mildly broken heart as a reason. Jay would strangle this young girl because of some run-of-the-mill high school drama?	20141128T082435

This is the second time that day they put Adnan in a vehicle with absolutely no explanation how he got there (Hae's car being the first) and it was not attacked by his defense. I just don't understand how this (and other inconsistencies) were not ripped to shreds. Sometimes I think the magnitude of this is overlooked. If there is no ""come get me"" call, then how would Jay know where to find Adnan with Hae's body that he has admits to help dispose of? How is Adnan involved in Hae's murder if he never called Jay about the murder?"	20141129T012056

To her surprise, it's not Adnan in the driver's seat, but Jay. Perfect! She just heard the other day that Jay was having other girls over his house while her best friend Stephanie was stuck at school! She's been meaning to confront Jay the next time she sees him! She starts to unload on Jay - calling him names, yelling at him, arguing louder and louder, making a scene, telling him that she's going to tell Stephanie that he's been stepping out, and maybe even some light-but-still-angry slapping. Jay is enraged by how trivial this all seems, and how this girl he doesn't even know all that well suddenly just got into the car and is now accusing HIM of being unfaithful. He loves Stephanie, but this is all so high-school-petty -- he doesn't need this shit. Doesn't she know who he is? What kind of criminal he is? He's out of high school -- he likes sleeping with Stephanie but does he really need some crazy high school chick he barely knows threatening to blow up his spot? No matter how much he tries to calm Hae down, she's getting more and more upset with him, and with every word, his ""animal rage"" gets bigger and bigger. Finally, to shut ""that bitch"" up, he realizes he has no choice but to knock her out, and he slams her head against the dashboard, leading to the bruising that was found on her head. But maybe that doesn't knock her out all the way, doesn't shut her up successfully, and she starts to really struggle and scream and he's worried she's going to make it out of the car and accuse him of assaulting her, and now he has no choice but to strangle her to shut her up once and for all."	20141128T120721
dev1anter	6	0	I guess she used this >Abraham Waranowitz testified as an expert in AT&T network design as to Erickson cell phone equipment........ >On cross-examination, Waranowitz admitted that the tests cannot tell where the call was made or where the cell phone was within the wide cell site. He admitted that some calls could trigger as many as three different cell sites. (2/9/00- 1 42- 1 72) It could explain it. Could. Anyway, that's just one little thing. We agree that this is a very good work by Susan. Also, Jay doesn't even have a narrative. His narrative is like 5 narratives. His and Jen's narratives don't work together either. At this point i think we can probably discount almost everything Jay says. Because Jay says so many things, he discounts even himself more than one time :)	20141128T005218
Archipelagi	10	0	"It's about taking the data in the aggregate, though. The usefulness of the data comes from the trends, not the individual points. When four witnesses all give the same testimony (""Adnan was at Cathy's house"") and the tower data all shows calls coming from near Cathy's house, that's good evidence that the tower data is showing us something meaningful. When everyone agrees that the cell phone was near Woodlawn, and 80% of those calls come from the Woodlawn tower, that's good evidence that Woodlawn calls are more likely to get routed through the Woodlawn tower. If we see a call come from Woodlawn and we don't know for sure where it is, it is reasonable to consider one strong possibility is that the phone was near Woodlawn. When no one claims that the cell phone could possibly have been in Ellicott City, and one call routes through Ellicott City and never again, we can feel pretty confident in treating that call as as non-significant."	20141128T033858
unbalancedopinion	1	0	Why do you think he has no motive? It's been established by Jay and others that knew him that he was protective of his relationship with Stephanie. It has also been established that Hae was friends with Stephanie. The only speculation is whether Jay was cheating on Stephanie, and if he was, if Hae knew about it. If that was the case and Hae confronted him, Jay did have a motive. Sure, we can argue about whether Jay was cheating (the possibility of which was brought up at trial) but it's not that far-fetched. Bottom line is that since they're all part of the same circle of friends, it's certainly a possibility.	20141128T231012

It's *plausible*. I grant to you that it totally could have gone down that way. But the problem is that there's not a shred of evidence for it actually having gone down that way. There's a shitload of evidence about the timeline after - the driving around with Adnan's phone, the phone calls, the changing narrative he gives police. But to that actual moment where a supposed verbal confrontation *by Hae* (which no one saw or testified to) turns into a physical confrontation by Jay which then goes out of control, there's nothing I have heard that indicates there is any evidence of it. However, while that theory might not be enough to convict Jay, it certainly might have been enough of an alternate theory to keep Adnan out of jail, if his attorney had presented that theory to the jury at the trial through the examination of those witnesses. Instead, she just tried to examine the credibility of Jay as a witness, rather than grill him on his possible (sole) role in the murder, which might have put sufficient doubt into the jury's minds to return a ""not guilty"" verdict on Adnan."	20141128T144534
neal17	2	0	Why would she confront Jay instead of telling Stephanie? How would confronting Jay stop him from cheating? He could lie and say he's going to be faithful.

jojoninja	0	0	I still think there's a good chance Hae and Jay had hooked up at some point. This is high school. There's a lot of sleeping around going on (or at least there was at my highschool and among my group of friends--but who knows maybe we were all sluts? I think teenagers have a very secret life that they don't disclose to anyone. There were things my friends and I did together or alone that NOBODY knew about.) and things easily could have escalated if the two of them had a brief fling and one of them threatened to out the hook up to Adnan/Stephanie. It's totally possible and would explain the snap outrage/emotional killing of Hae by Jay.	20141129T012247
anonymous	5	0	I agree. It *could* explain it. Jay's accounts are certainly not believable. However, we can be sure there is *some truth* in his accounts somewhere, especially in his fist account (unless he is not involved at all - let's not go there).

anonymous	3	0	"Yes I agree with that. But there is no dispute about many of the calls and locations. It's the very few we have a problem about ... For example, take our friend the 2:36. Susan says > Jae was in [the] vicinity of Hae's last-known location. Because the phone records also show that Jae was not at Jenn's house that afternoon (as he and Jen claim), that leaves us the following ... This deduction simply cannot be made and presented as fact: (1) there is evidence to question whether Jay was at Jen's at 12:07 or 12:41. But where is the evidence that he is not at Jen's at 2:36? It isn't there (he *could* be with Hae, but he *could* be at Jen's). (2) L651B is a fraction of land from Jen's house; with the error inherent in the tower data, which Susan pointed out earlier, it is absolutely OK to argue that this call shows that Jay was probably in Jen's house, and it is absolutely not correct to argue that the phone record *shows* that > (1) Jay was near Hae and (2) Jay has no alibi Then our 3:15 friend ...

Dysbrainiac	2	0	"This is how most murders happen. One also have to remember that strangulation is a very violent act that in most cases requires anger if not rage. I believe this speaks against Jays testimony that Adnan planned this for days before, if so why didn't he ""tool up"" so to speak and shot, or even less intimately violent, poisoned her. Also, regardless of who did it, a lot of luck would be/were needed to get away with it, so it was surely poorly planned, if at all. Secondly regarding Jays testimony about what he thinks the reason were why Adnan called him after the murder. It is interesting because in this speculative ""jay did it timeline"" Jay called Patrick after the murder, maybe the most criminal element in his life, his marijuana wholesale supplier. Another thing that bothers me, why did Jay get so upset, according to Jenn, by wiping fingerprints of a shovel/s, before this he had just buried a dead body but he was not visible upset by that apparently (or it was not worth mentioning by Jenn)."	20141128T162715

Ratava	1	0	Oh of course there's no evidence that was Hae's personality, and you're right, no one witnessed Jay and Hae arguing. Buuuuuut, there's also no evidence that premeditated murder was part of Adnan's personality, and certainly no one witnessed Adnan strangling Hae.	20141128T161013
Ojisan1	3	0	Those are all excellent points but it still doesn't give us the crucial missing info - what in Jay's mind was so bad that drove him to actually murder someone? I've been plenty pissed off at people but I've never even come close to that sort of rage, so what is it about Jay and Hae that things came to such an end? All of what you are saying makes sense, I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around that core motive in Jay's case. In Adnan's case, the theory is weak, but at least there is some kind of theory of why. But as was said elsewhere in this thread, wrong place wrong time sometimes is all the answer there really is, and there will maybe never be a satisfying answer as to why it happened the way it did, even if we all think the way it happened was by Jay's hand.	20141128T170652

Dysbrainiac	3	0	True, it is a fact that Adnan could maybe have had a motive. This and the fact that the police could plausibly put him in Haes car after school is obvioulsy the reason why they took Jays story and ran with it. If they hadn't it is hard to see what more evidence they could have found to be able to convict Jay for murder. Even if they find forensic evidence on Hae from Jay it doesn't contradict his story. Maybe Jenn and/or Patrick could be pressured to tell the truth maybe. However it is possible that that wouldn't prove to be sufficient evidence anyhow. So Adnan was the guy to prosecute or it would end up in the Unsolved stack of cases. Also maybe Adnan did it, but I find that unconvincing though. I really hopes SK tells us more about Phil and Patrick.	20141128T173031

sticksandmatches	0	0	I don't think so. If he was I feel there would have been allusions to the fact in hai's diary as well as inconsistent character references from people who knew Adnan. Being a sociopath means doing sociopathic actions and we have never seen anything from Adnan to indicate that. You can be guilty of murder without being a sociopath. You Can be intelligent, kind and good natured without being a sociopath. I'd go so far to say that the two above examples aren't mutually exclusive.	20141128T012007
sticksandmatches	1	0	That's true. He's not necessarily a sociopath. The point I was trying to make is based on the evidence we have virtually nothing would indicate that adnan was sociopath.

Hae's body was found on February 9th. Jay did not lead them to the ditch site until February 28th. I would iike to see how difficult it would have been to conduct a search for a car, because I do not believe that a car located within a one and one half mile radius of the crime scene would have gone undiscovered if any serious effort was made to find it.

And then, pages 35-36, she mentions how she and Jay became better friends during high school, but she doesn't know if Adnan went to high school with them? But she just said she had seen his car at school before!!! Isn't that just a little strange? Yeah, maybe they didn't graduate the same year, and maybe they hardly saw each other because she was in ""gen-pop"" with Jay, but don't you think they would have gone to school together if Jay was dating Stephanie and Adnan was good friends with Stephanie? I don't know if it's a petty detail or not, but she's always switching what she says about whether she knew it was Adnan's car or not. On page 19, she says that she did ask Jay about the car, but before that, she mentions that she didn't ask him, she just assumed.

pj12341234	3	0	My point is that having a wife and children doesn't mean your past goes away.

whitenoise2323	2	0	"Omigod this kind of makes sense. It was probably a blue highlighter because that turns up black in photocopies. Still... it's a random name highlighting pattern and the document was called ""jay's real name redacted blah blah blah"" so, who knows."	20141128T052702
belleslettres	2	0	"Oh yeah, that stuff is definitely inconsistent. There were just a couple of places where even statements like ""kill Hae"" looked like they were redacted, so the highlighter thing makes a little more sense there."	20141128T053535
platorithm	10	0	I took it to mean that Jay didn't want a boot print of soil from the burial site matching his boots. This seems like a reasonable fear to me.

anonymous	9	0	**Stephanie was not Hae's best friend.** Why do people keep saying this? We don't even know if they were friends! All these Hae-confronting-Jay theories revolve around Hae caring deeply about what Jay was up to, and there is no reason to think she did.	20141128T022528
partymuffell	14	0	The only source of this rumor is Adnan. In fact, not even Adnan tries to sell this story to anyone anymore. Only Rabia and Saad. The credibility of this story is already next to zero as far as I am concerned, but you are making a good point, which corroborates what I already believe. This is a self-serving fabrication, which Adnan himself abandoned when he realized that he couldn't consistently maintain that Jay cared so much about Stephanie that he would kill to protect their relationship but so little that he doesn't even remember to buy her a birthday present. Wisely, Adnan decided to stick to the latter story and the only people I know who buy the former are subredditors here.	20141128T022511
goliath_franco	2	0	I agree that we could expect to find Hae writing about her knowledge of Jay's cheating (if he was cheating) in her diary, and because we haven't heard about it yet, I am guessing that she doesn't write anything about Jay cheating or confronting Jay about cheating in her diary.	20141128T053328
anonymous	2	0	I'd like to know if jay is ever mentioned in the diary for any reason	20141128T113434
whydontyouaskher	2	0	I don't put much stock in Jay's infidelity (if it happened) being a motive to kill Hae, but I think it's normal to have gaps in your diary like that. At least, it was for me when I was a 17 year old girl, and I always kept a diary as a teenager. Sometimes I would write pages and pages in one entry, and then I wouldn't write anything for weeks, even if something significant happened. Also, remember that SK said that Hae didn't write about the homecoming incident with Adnan's parents, which was a pretty big deal.	20141128T144609
I_W_N_R	1	0	I see where you're going, but I don't think we can assume that Hae's diary represents an exhaustive account of everything that was going on in her life at the time. There could be all kinds of reasons why Hae chose not to write about certain things in her diary. This is a compelling case, and the folks who have been sucked into it (myself included) want answers that have remained elusive due to the gaps in evidence. So there's a natural tendency to look for ways to fill in those gaps.	20141128T060010
avecsarah	1	0	Who knows why teenagers journal about certain things and not others? After the episode with her diary aired, I went to my mom's house and looked over my diaries from high school - lots in there about boyfriends, band, sports, etc - nothing about my friend's boyfriends infidelities (which were happening), dad's illness, my panic over the iraq war, or anything else of real magnitude. Maybe it was teenage self-importance, or maybe it was a self protective mechanism so I wouldn't dwell on painful or complicated issues.	20141128T175630
anonymous	2	0	A valid point. I guess my take on it is she probably would have at least mentioned someone telling her about it, as that kind of thing is a pretty big deal to a bunch of teenage girls. If Jay was cheating on Stephanie, Hae found out about it and wanted to confront him, it suddenly becomes something that going is on with her.	20141128T060332
anonymous	12	0	I don't think that Sarah has ever referred to Stephanie as Hae's best friend, but whenever this comes up I always think of the [Mindy Project take on best friends.](http://i.imgur.com/8JfYdL0.gif)	20141128T023858
serialisgreat	5	0	You are right that they were not best friends. In her statements to investigators, Stephanie identified Hae's best friends as Aisha and Debbie. (http://www.splitthemoon.com/?p=199) However, it seems like they were friends. Stephanie stated that when she learned that Hae's body was found and Hae had been killed, she and Adnan (Hae's ex-boyfriend of course) went together to see Aisha (Hae's best friend) at Aisha's house. Interpret this how you like, but Adnan and Aisha were both very close with Hae, obviously, and this seems to me like a group of Hae's friends leaning on each other for emotional support. This is the time when Adnan tried to call Detective O'Shea.	20141128T024232
anonymous	2	0	Sorry, I should have specified 'one of'. Call their relationship what you will - good friends, best friends, classmates; the main point is that they were in a tight-knit group and hung out together fairly often. The lack of Hae-confronting-Jay evidence in her diary supports what you are saying, in that Hae must've either a) not known about Jay's alleged infidelity, and if so, b) didn't care enough to confront him about it. I'm essentially trying to put the theory of Jay's motive to kill Hae in the context of her diary: if that's what was really happening, it's highly likely she'd write about it. We know she didn't, thereby making the Jay killed Haw theory based on this motive highly unlikely.	20141128T023513
mke_504	5	0	"Don't forget about Jay's friend who tells SK that Jay would ""move heaven and herff"" for Stephanie."	20141128T061943
serialisgreat	3	0	"I agree that without some kind of corroboration this story has a serious credibility problem, but for different reasons. First of all, as far as we know Adnan *himself* never maintained that this was a real possibility. So far all we've seen is a note regarding a question Adnan asked a paralegal. I don't think Adnan ever got far enough to question if he could ""consistently maintain"" this suggestion. This is the biggest issue for me. If Adnan, who was there, doesn't firmly believe it, why should we? > This is a self-serving fabrication, which Adnan himself abandoned when he realized that he couldn't consistently maintain that Jay cared so much about Stephanie that he would kill to protect their relationship but so little that he doesn't even remember to buy her a birthday present. There isn't much to argue about here as we simply hold different opinions, but I think this presents an unrealistically logic-driven interpretation of the messy way that human beings approach romantic relationships."	20141128T025315
anonymous	6	0	As murky as this whole case is, I think putting this theory into the context of Hae's diary really makes is highly unlikely that Jay killed Hae, at least based on this motive alone.	20141128T023906
anonymous	1	0	Ohhhh, me too! I'd like to think that if he was, SK may have mentioned it, but then again it might not immediately occur to her to use that. I guess that, because she doesn't seem to buy the fact that Jay could potentially have killed Hae, her relationship to Jay doesn't matter as much as Adnan's relationship to Jay.	20141128T115614
anonymous	2	0	I agree, and this was something I was definitely considering when trying to articulate this. I guess that... Those who suggest this is a clear motive as to why Jay would kill Hae, make her confronting Jay seem like some momentous event. I just feel that, if it was a big enough deal (that allegedly resulted in her death), it would warrant even a mention in her diary.	20141128T080425

serialisgreat	2	0	I don't agree that this would have necessarily appeared in Hae's diary. We haven't seen the diary so we don't know, but if it primarily concerns Hae herself, it's possible that she did not focus on writing about other people's relationships and instead used it as an outlet for feelings about her own relationships.	20141128T024646
partymuffell	4	0	let's put it this way---there is no aspect of this story that is credible. Even admitting that Jay had an affair with Jen (who incidentally, for all we know, might be gay) and even admitting Hae knew about it, why wouldn't she tell Stephanie in the first place? Why would she confront Jay? And why would she do that before going to pick up her cousin from school? What's the urgency? And why would Jay kill her? He seems the most chilled out stoner dude in the world. And it's not as if she's THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS. Adnan allegedly knew too. How would Hae know otherwise? But if Adnan knew, why doesn't he ever mention it? *Nothing* makes sense in this story. The only explanation of its popularity in this sub is that people would believe anything to believe little old Adnan is as innocent as a lamb...	20141128T030017
I_W_N_R	1	0	I'm with you on Jay's motive - the only evidence we really have of that is Adnan's word, which alone isn't enough for me to assume it. But I just don't think we know enough about Hae to make assumptions about what she would or would not have written about in her diary, so the fact that she didn't mention it there doesn't make a difference to me. Also, one big reason we don't know more about whether Jay had motive is that the police didn't look for one. They were laser focused on Adnan pretty early on, and their whole investigation was about building a case against Adnan.	20141128T143629

anonymous	4	0	Mindy Project is my favorite thing on TV these days! But going back to my favorite thing on public radio, I think this is a really insightful point. That Hae doesn't seem to have mentioned distress over Jay and Stephanie's relationship at least suggests that it wasn't something that she was overly concerned about.	20141128T024842
anonymous	1	0	Good point. I just feel like confronting Jay, who is an older and potentially dominating guy to Hae, is an event that would cause her to have to think about the best way to approach him. If this was her plan, I feel like this is a kind of issue significant enough to warrant at least a mention in a diary entry.	20141128T060613
partymuffell	2	0	"Your recollection of what??? You are talking about this as if it were a fact but Adnan doesn't mention or eve hint in the podcast that Jay was cheating on Stephanie or Adnan telling Hae about that. Where do you people get your "" information"" from?"	20141128T154001
partymuffell	2	0	This speculation is completely unsupported by the evidence. Adnan never mentions this fact. The only possible motive he provides for Jay falsely accusing him (not of murdering Hae!) is that Jay might have been jealous of Adnan's relationship with Stephanie and even that he does not clearly endorse. I wish people on this sub were clearer about the distinction between facts and fiction.	20141128T155225

mrmiffster	7	0	I agree you would have to be a genius to remember the minutiae that Jay remembers about the murder if it was actually true that he heard them second-hand from Adnan. He would have to have a flippin photographic memory. I think we can be pretty confident that Jay is not a genius though. The likelihood is that Jay remembers details from the murder that only a murderer would know because he is in fact the murderer.	20141128T134045
partymuffell	27	0	"It's not just that... it's that he chose the perfect day to kill Hae and frame our innocent sacrificial lamb, li'l Adnan. He had his phone, his car, he spent much of the morning and most of the afternoon with him, but then he dropped him off at the mosque and said ""Hey, Ahdmand, do you mind if I borrow your car and your cell for a while while you are in there?"". All of this of course, triggered by gift envy... A very common motive for murder. Oh no! Actually, Hae happened to confront him on that very day! The day he had Adnan's cell phone and car! How very lucky for an impulse murderer! She had to pick up her cousin from school but she thought---I'm going to go and confront Jay wherever he is now. This is why she didn't give Adnan a ride because she HAD to confront Jay. Oh and buy pot from him too while she was there."	20141128T024703
beatwman	11	0	I don't understand why Adnan gets a pass for having a shoddy memory, but Jay is held to a different standard. Maybe he doesn't remember everywhere they went or what time it was, and he's clearly trying to cover his own ass, but he is adamant about the main events that took place. Lets not forget Adnan's inconsistent stories to police about whether or not he asked Hae for a ride that day. Why doesn't that seem to bother more people?	20141128T050745

bencoccio	6	0	The only 'broad brush-strokes that remains' in Jay's many, many stories is 'Adnan did it.' Does it make it more believable just because he repeats the key thing he would repeat if Jay had killed Hae and wanted to pin it on Adnan?	20141128T081650
anonymous	6	0	I'm trying to figure out exactly what Jenn said that implicated Adnan aside from repeating parts of Jay's story. Her entire statement seemed to minimize her involvement while paving the way for Jay to finger Adnan for a crime I am now more convinced they committed together. Jenn was attempting to explain away any suspicious behavior she displayed as well as alibi her and Jay for 1-3:30 or is it until 3:45-4:14. Now I have more questions. What's up with the first 1/13 call at 12:07 to Jenn's home pinging by Ellicott City? Could he be picking her up from work and she's calling home? What about Jenn saying she picked Jay up at Westview Mall and Jay saying Jenn picked him up at home? What is the significance of this change in Jay's story?	20141128T063926
anonymous	5	0	"I think he killed Hae with Adnan, but pinned it on Adnan. This makes the most sense to me. If the truth came out Adnan would still be guilty, which is why he just plays the ""prove it"" card."	20141128T064151
pj12341234	1	0	Jenn was always going to drawn in at some point, due to the phone calls that day. Jay also drags Jenn in to the plot by getting her to help hide the evidence. Jay's hardly going to admit murdering Hae to Jenn, so it make sense for him to pin it on someone else, and since he had Adnan's car and cellphone, Adnan would be the obvious patsy. If you look at Jenn's testimony, at no point does she say Adnan did it.. She just says that Jay told her that Adnan did it. There's no evidence so far that Jenn knowingly framed Adnan.	20141128T191036
Mustanggertrude	0	0	"But what is jay's involvement? Over and over ""he lied bc he was more involved"" well how? Did he hold her legs? Did he insert a hand? Did he flag her down?

Superben14	33	0	"""Have you seen these graphs?"" -Adnan Yeah you can frame it like that. The alternative is that this was not a premeditated murder by Jay. Jay borrowed Adnan's car and phone for non-nefarious purposes, ran into Hae, and because of <insert motive here> kills her. He then frantically tries to find a way to keep anyone from being suspicious (including Adnan) and dump the body. This includes giving Adnan a few rides, begging Adnan to let him keep borrowing his phone, frantically calling Jenn for a ride, etc. Somewhere near the end, he figures he might be able to pin this all on Adnan. Luckily for him, the cops buy it early and feed him all the info he needs to match his story to one that makes Adnan look guilty. Unfortunately for the cops they still manage to fail miserably at this and Jay can't keep his story straight from one telling to the next. Even more unfortunately for Adnan, the Jury does not know the meaning of ""innocent until proven guilty"""	20141128T030122
serialisgreat	15	0	I agree that if Adnan is innocent his luck is incredibly, ridiculously, just absolutely outrageously bad. The difference between you and me is that in the last two weeks I've come around to thinking that Adnan's luck *really was* that bad.	20141128T025910

I couldn't tell you everything I did last week Monday, much less 2 months ago. (Of course, if you assume Adnan is guilty, then he just seems like a great liar.) The difference with Jay is that we KNOW he's involved. He admitted it (at least partially). If someone cajoled or blackmailed or whatever'd me into helping them bury someone I knew...I'd probably remember that day a lot better.	20141128T075324
donailin1	15	0	because Adnan is SUPER SWEET, he would never harm a fly. And he's been framed, and has no reason to hurt the girl that broke his heart. He was over it,he was a PLAYER. Just because he called Hae 3 times the night before she was murdered and never dialed her phone or pager number ever again after that night means nothing -- it's trivial, he was beside all the people who were always calling her. Poor Adnan. ed. for missing word.	20141128T052328
pj12341234	2	0	If Adnan is innocent, there's no reason for him to remember every detail about the day, as it was just another average day to him. Jay's lying about where he saw the body ( Best Buy, Edmonton Avenue, the Pool Hall, depending which version you look at.. at least 2 out of 3 must be lies ) is clearly deliberate. If Jay is telling the truth and Adnan murdered Hae, the location of the trunk pop would be indelibly etched in his memory.	20141128T154847
Ionosi	14	0	There'd be a continuous invention going on (if he's lying) that's impressive far beyond the inconsistencies of where trunk-popping occurred. Creating details about Adnan's reactions, dialogue, where they were, what they did, how so-and-so felt, the color of clothes, etc. It would be an amazing display of extemporaneous deceit (if that's what it is), to the point where I'm not sure if someone *can* lie that fluently.	20141128T030432

For them to find it and then decide to leave it in some random lot because they expect an inconsistent witness to come forward and might need it to shore up his testimony, when it the meantime anything could happen (killer could come back and move it, car could get stolen, winter weather could wash evidence away). Assuming some level of police corruption/incompetence is one thing, but the long timeline and oddly specific foresight make it seem really unlikely.	20141128T161037

MusicCompany	3	0	Completely agree. As someone who has written a lot of fiction and taken a bunch of fiction writing classes, I would say that for Jay to have made up this story complete with dialogue and other details, he would have the talent to be a best-selling crime writer. And writers have time to sit and rewrite--he's doing all of this off the cuff. The lies he tells are simple ones. For example, in his first story, he leaves out Cathy's house. It seems clear he's trying to protect people and keep them out of this. It's relatively easy to lie about a location and then tell the truth of what happened from there. But to make up a sequence of events and interactions is very very difficult.	20141128T160004
serialisgreat	2	0	I really disagree. If this was a Usual Suspects situation where he crafted a compelling and *consistent* narrative on the fly then yes, I would be impressed.

stiltent	4	0	Remember how all his friends said he lied about little things? He was really good at lying about small details for no discernible reason.

And more so, it's perfectly plausible.	20141128T040824
anonymous	8	0	I don't understand your logic at all. Here's what I think you're saying: Jay is telling the truth because he invents new details and changes old ones in each subsequent interview, and Adnan is lying because he can't remember anything. Is that it?	20141128T041744

shapshapboetie	3	0	Yes, he's putting forth an alternative theory: that Jay killed Hae because of <unknown reason> and then covered it up, sold the police on the story, and traded testimony against Adnan for a walk on his own culpability. Since the evidence against Adnan is Jay's testimony + circumstantial evidence of location based on cell records, the conviction was a weak one. Without Jay's testimony, Adnan walks and it's a stone cold whodunnit.	20141128T030826
ShrimpChimp	2	0	"Leaving the car out there is also exposure. If there was any way to show that they new about the car or that the car had been called in, and the police didn't respond to that, then they are wide open for all kinds of action from Hae's family or any victims advocacy groups who could reach out to the family. The kind of coaching many allege happens all the time. Literally all the time. It's as easy to find as lightly padded expense report. Throw-down guns, manufactured evidence and tampering at the level required for the ""cops told Jay about the car"" scenario are a very hard sell."	20141128T172227

But he just killed a person with his bare hands."" As someone who was in high school at the same time as these guys were, it really resonated with me. I remember having eerily similar conversations with my male counterparts at school after they had committed a crime. Never murder, but things like assault and theft with a deadly weapon and such. The quote is too perfect to have been made up on the spot. At least to me. As a writer myself, this is a quote I would have drawn from real life conversations. The detectives weren't leading him towards this statement. They asked Jay if there was a conversation between the two while Jay was taking Adnan to track practice.

I have met people like this and they can be incredibly convincing even when you know that they must be lying. I have had guys tell me long detailed stories about things (ie captaining a luxury yacht for a billionaire oil sheik, being in elite armed forces) that seem completely true and believable, except they're not- they are compulsive liars. Often you only catch these guys out when you hear them tell the same story you have heard to someone else and suddenly details change or are embellished.

If anyone said that to me while I was investigating a murder, I would have to shift my focus from his story to him."	20141128T034409
whydontyouaskher	3	0	Yes, but by the same token, Adnan was also an experienced liar. Trust me, when you have to continuously lie to your parents/community in order to get by, it's not like a line you can draw in the sand where you only lie to them and it doesn't effect your behaviour with other people. You get good at lying to everyone, figuring out what people want to hear, and making it sound convincing. They were both liars. Adnan is just a better liar.	20141128T154046

anonymous	2	0	Sure. sounds odd but could also be Jays last ditch effort to save his ass if guilty. He was afraid of murder 1 and feared they'd catch him eventually through Jenn so he went in and helped them get Adnan, their primary suspect, and avoided all charges.

Junipermuse	8	0	My memory is pretty spotty about the day I learned my first boyfriend (and the first boy I ever kissed) had died. It was some time in the last year. I remember I was driving in my car and I remember where the car was (the part of town I was in, direction the car was headed) and I remember who told me. But I don't know where I was headed (my final destination), or where I was coming from. I don't remember what time of day it was, and I can't even remember if the person who told me was in the car with me or on the phone. Memory is imperfect, it is hard to say why we remember some things and not others. It is unfair to assume that someone is lying because their memory is spotty. Likewise it isn't uncommon to invent small details to bolster an untrue story, chances are a practiced liar has already honed that skill somewhat.	20141128T045239
anonymous	5	0	Okay let me put this another way. You're willing to ignore one guy's lies because at least they're detailed, but the other guy must be guilty because he may be lying although he's never actually been caught lying. Is that how it goes? I'm just trying to understand	20141128T043201

What was Adnan's motive? Getting dumped? Despite several accounts backing up the fact that he wasn't completely devastated or vengeful, except from Jay, an acquaintance he feels happy to let in on his plan to murder his ex girlfriend, without a care in the world he might be stopped? I'm still undecided, but honestly truly baffled that you think the case against Adnan is any more plausible than that set forth against Jay.	20141128T040124
shapshapboetie	8	0	Jay and the detectives filled in holes to convict Adnan. It shouldn't be too hard to conjur up a storyline going the other way to determine motive, means, and opportunity. And, crucially, the detectives would have had to pursue that theory of the case so as to interview people with that theory in mind. We cannot come up with convincing alternative theories based on the podcast though. You would need the whole case file. And the podcast is concerned about libel. Detectives don't have that worry.	20141128T031648
barbaraalmeida	0	0	"I think envy/hate could be a potential motive. Adnan was handsome, popular, ""good with the ladies"", homecoming prince (with Stephanie?), the golden boy of his community, scholarship and all that. He had a great relationship with Stephanie, bought her gifts, worried about her, etc. Stephanie's was the only one good thing in Jay's life. Jay was drug dealer, working at a videostore, many people didnt have a good impression of him to the point that some ppl wouldnt be surprised if he had killed someone, etc. jay was then very protective of Stephanie, which he might have thought Adnan was taking her away from him. Out of revenge or something, he could have gotten back through Hae... Not sure that I stand by this theory, but there could be a reason why Jay killed Hae"	20141128T143021
bencoccio	8	0	Actually, for this Adnan-Is-Innocent guy, the 'big picture' is the problem. The big picture is a guy kills his ex-girl because he's jilted. That's it. That's the whole big picture. Right? Am I missing something? All the crazy shit that makes no sense makes perfect sense because of Adnan's *motive*. All the shitty circumstantial evidence, the clearly *deeply* involved witness who's only consistent part of his story is 'Adnan did it,' the totally ridiculous timeline that the state put together and a friggin sub reddit helped demolish, the motive that isn't much of a motive until the only person with knowledge of the crime tells the only tale of Adnan saying he's going to kill his ex gf, and yes, a suspect who is willing to kill his ex out of nowhere when he had no history of violence before or since -- all that's okay because of the big picture: Kid kills ex gf cause he's pissed about being sad. That's it. The Adnan-is-guilty crowd can basically ignore all the ridiculous shit that made up the state's case ('real life is messy, come on!'), say Jay, who *admits* to lying over and over again, is *clearly* more trustworthy than Adnan ('he admits to lying so that's like the first thing you do before you really level and tell the God's honest, come on!'), and ignore that even in the snippets we heard on the podcast, the police are totally in the tank already for Adnan being guilty and leading the conversation with the person who really should at least have been considered a stand alone suspect *because*: Dumped BF kills X GF 'cause dumped. For the Adnan-is-guilty set, the big picture is so big, it's like you guys can't see the *trees* for the *forest*. They some fake-ass trees.	20141128T055838

The boyfriend/husband/ex is likelier to have motive and opportunity, which gives law enforcement something to latch on to, especially when there aren't any clear leads. You have to figure that in some percent of cases the significant other becomes the prime suspect simply because there are no others and statistically it's likely, at which point everything we've heard about confirmation bias, witness leading, etc... can kick in and in some percent of cases deliver a wrongful conviction.	20141128T155838

The vast majority of those murdered women fit a totally different profile than Hae - they are older, poorer, in a violently abusive relationship with their partner, they live or lived with that partner and share or shared custody of children with that partner. Ex girlfriends in high school are not getting choked out by their ex boyfriends who have absolutely no record. That is still ridiculously rare. You can't effectively lump this case into your statistic. It's intellectually lazy and it doesn't make this flimsy motive more plausible. The motive is not convincing to me.

Jay realizes that if Jen goes down, so does he. Honestly, tell me what you would have him do if he didn't try to pin it on AS? Stonewalling means cops have to investigate. Find more witnesses. Examine forensics. Examine each part of his story to test it. Eg is there a phone at best buy? That could be very bad for him if guilty. Best choice seems to me to blame AS and hope for best. Stonewalling seems as dangerous or more so	20141128T210040
anonymous	1	0	Nice story. AS behavior is without a doubt suspicious. this is indeed the only way that anyone can convict AS -- by interpreting his behavior as too odd to be due to chance alone. Afterall, there is no evidence that directly links him to murder or burial except Jay. That is, we have our version of what an innocent Adnan would do, and the guilty one doesn't match it, so he's guilty. fine. It's not as easy to interpret Jays behavior as odd. I mean he did confess to almost everything except murder and the evidence, at least pings+calls, links him to everything but murder. So A is guilty because his behavior is odd while J is innocent of murder because he confessed to everything but murder. This logic baffles my mind. I don't claim to understand why anyone does anything including myself. and so there's no way I could convict based on what seems odd and what doesn't.	20141128T205038

Oh, he showed no signs of abusive behavior? I'm sure he was just good at covering up his seething, murderous rage. After all, boyfriends *usually* kill girlfriends.'

anonymous	0	0	I am a lawyer. Reasonable doubt has never been explicitly defined in the US, however it essentially means that any doubt that does not affect a reasonable person's belief that the defendant is guilty is permissible. It is a very high standard, however it is subjective and varies from juror to juror. I haven't reviewed all the evidence, so it's impossible for me to say whether the prosecution met their burden, however I believe a 3rd party and/or Jay killing her and perfectly framing Adnan is not reasonable (especially with what we know about what evidence was presented at trial). And they totally could have charged both of them. They were co-conspirators to the murder (and when showing a conspiracy prosecutors do not need to prove particular roles of the conspirators e.g. who actually strangled the victim). It is at the prosecutions discretion on which individuals (or the entire conspiracy) to indict based on the evidence they have collected in their investigation. Note:This should not be construed as legal advice.	20141128T212859

Even though Don is a likely suspect, given that he is the murdered girl's boyfriend, and murdered females are *most often* the victims of their partners, he has an alibi. Now our friend Adnan, he was also romantically linked, very recently, to the murdered girl. This also gives rise to suspicions that he might have murdered her, because females who are murdered do have a tendency to be murdered by such persons. Let's STOP THERE. Does this prove that Adnan murdered Hae? No, it most certainly does not. Does this mean there's a 50% chance he did it? No it does not. A 1% chance? I would say that's about right, maybe a little higher. But you see this makes it more likely than a random person, for whom the figure is close to zero. So let's look a little closer ... Now, you see this guy Adnan gave this guy Jay his car and cell phone that morning and this guy Jay is certainly involved in some way. He also hung out with this guy, in the morning, in the late afternoon and evening. OK, now our probability starts to rise. Let's check on Don. OK, he doesn't seem to be involved with this shady dude in any way; he's still down at around 1%. Everyone else is at about 0%.

anonymous	1	0	"To be clear, I'm not intentionally arguing for or against Adnan's guilt. I'm simply convinced that there's no way to solve this case without assuming someone did it and then working backwards. >I'm pointing to a number of improbable events and occurrences as well, and I ask myself what the probability is for all these events to occur, in conjunction with these unusual behaviours fair enough. But what is the factual basis of your probabilities? * For instance, one could ask, ""what is the likelihood that Adnan could spend most of the day with Jay and know absolutely nothing about the murder?"" But it is really not an established fact that Adnan did spend the day with Jay. We know they were together in the morning and after track, but the burial itself is Jay's word against Adnan's. * Another example: What is the likelihood that Jay would be able to exploit Adnan's generosity in lending Jay his car and phone on the day that Jay decides to murder Hae? Again, one could see this as highly very unlikely, or one could use the unconfirmed allegation that Adnan often lent his car to Jay. Or perhaps Adnan lent his car to Jay for the morning but then Jay asked to keep it. But the point is that there really isn't that much of a factual basis on which to judge the likelihood of Jay randomly exploiting AS' generosity. * Another example: What is the likelihood that Jay would risk confessing to about 95% of the murder if he did the whole thing? One way to answer this is to argue that it would be irrational to take such a risk. But an alternative perspective is that Jay was backed against the wall and had no real choice. They had Jenn because of the call logs, and some calls to her came through right when Hae went missing. Of course, her and Jay could have stonewalled, but then the cops would have had to really investigate -- collect/analyze all evidence, find and interview all witnesses, try to check each part of Jay's story (e.g. look for phone at Best Buy or look for shovel(s) etc) . During this investigation, if they found anything at all, Jay would look really bad. So one could argue that he came forward because it was the best course of action, and once he came forward he had to pin it on AS to get them off his case. so while I definitely agree that one can theoretically think about the probability of all of these events occurring if AS is innocent as highly improbable, I just don't buy the factual basis of most of them."	20141130T155240

Here's another definition of beyond reasonable doubt: >The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution: that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Since it's impossible to rule out Jay as killer, there is another logical explanation and thus reasonable doubt. No idea why AS couldn't defend himself. Should have been easy. Waiting for next episode to find out more about the trials.	20141128T225714
shapshapboetie	2	0	">It didn't seem weak to the judge Maybe, maybe not. But that's not the judge's role. It's the jury's. The judge did speculate about Adnan's motives/ methods, but we wouldn't know the judge's doubts. Anyway, this kind of judge in Maryland is [selected for a one-year term](http://judgepedia.org/Judicial_selection_in_Maryland#Circuit_Court). They are not confirmed by the State Senate. But, then, they're put up for election. The trial happened during [the judge's primary campaign](http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/41electp/html/2000p/00judp.html). So, we cannot put much faith in the judge's opinions or approach. It was her first year on the bench. In her first judicial role. In a high profile case. During her re-election. I wouldn't put much faith in such a judge. ([This former Maryland judge agrees](http://www.apursuitofjustice.com/marylands-judicial-election-system-needs-fixing-now-more-than-ever)) with me that judicial elections are a dysfunctional system. >It didn't seem weak to the prosecutors. Sorry, but you can't include the prosecutors in that argument. They hinged their case upon the unreliable, inconsistent testimony of someone who was at least an accessory after the fact (and perhaps more). They had no direct physical evidence. They had a flimsy motive for Adnan. And they did not have to go up against his library alibi. That all means they had a weak case, but won anyway. >the MD Innocence Project apparently turned down Adnan's case Also, according to Rabia Choudry, the Innocence Project rejected his case because there was no exculpatory DNA evidence. So you cannot include them either. >Many years ago Adnan applied to the Innocence Project of Maryland. They rejected his application due to “lack of DNA evidence in the case.” She continues: >One of the major reasons cited for wrongful convictions is the informant – 18% of all wrongful convictions that are overturned are convictions based on a witness/informant who was offered some sweet incentives in return for their testimony. Incentives like money, release from prison, immunity from prosecution, or reduced/vacated sentences. Sound familiar? It should. >And if you are referring to Jim Trainum he never says that the case is weak actually Jim Trainum said there was something off about the case, and was skeptical of the detective's for not investigating Jay more closely, using a polygraph, searching for home, and that ""they probably settled for what was good enough to be the truth."" So, he said, ""I don't believe Jay's version. I feel he is definitely minimizing his involvement..."" In sum, you and the jury think it was a strong case. That's it."	20141128T165118
bencoccio	1	0	So we agree - the fact that Adnan was Hae's ex can basically be ignored when you're trying to figure out who killed her.	20141129T013403
Dr__Nick	1	0	Involving Jen certainly wasn't smart. Or at least telling her a different story About what was happening other than the apparent truth.	20141129T011308
anonymous	1	0	Thanks yes. It depends. In this investigation the cops found some info. The anonymous call, then Adnan's phone, the Jenn's on the call log, Jenn, Jay - it was only then that they had a real suspect, everything took off. I would imagine that in other situations you might have no evidence as of yet, then make an assumption, then test its plausibility - that's more the scientific method I suppose, The cops didn't investigate this case well at all of course. Once they had Adnan they went down that road, so much so that they more or less took Jay's word for it and then twisted his story to fit their own (very likely) incorrect time-line. They had enough to convict him once they had Jay's story lined up. I wish they had gathered more evidence (e.g. call logs for homes of Jenn, Jay - how hard would that have been?). But anyway, my amateur self, I have to assume *someone* did it. It could be (1) Adnan, (2) Jay, (3) Jay and Adnan, (4) Jay & others, (5) other(s). Look at the evidence and test the plausibility. I have been brief on the issues, the tower pings, the unlikely scenarios and far-fetched stories, as it would take a 100-page Blog. I know that is unsatisfactory, but I also know that you know them all in any case. When I consider them all as one body of evidence, I am led to (1). As of now. You know, what I really want are Adnan's statements to the Police (as opposed to what he says to SK in 2014). I wonder will they ever become available.	20141201T082225
anonymous	0	0	Yeah I kind of agree with you (but I haven't even seen close to all of the evidence). And of course they didn't try to prosecute as co-conspirators as Jay was a star witness who broke the case wide open. We're also talking about a jury trial where actual evidence was presented and none of the jurors were presented with evidence that Jay was the killer. It's not a logical explanation. There is no motive and there was lots of evidence against Adnan. The jurors found Jay very credible. Also that impossibility to rule out a potential suspect is exactly the kind of doubt that can be overlooked. So far from what I've gathered I just think his defense attorney wasn't that great.	20141128T233714
anonymous	1	0	Well, let's say we disagree. That's cool.	20141129T041755
anonymous	1	0	I have to assume someone did it, too, but (1) and (2) seem about equally plausible to me. That is, (1) is probable because we have multiple pieces of circumstantial evidence suggesting AS is lying about his actions on the day of the murder and thus is not innocent, which implies some level of guilt. With (2), we have what amounts to a confession from Jay to *everything* but murder coupled with nearly undisputed evidence that he is a pathological liar and no alibi for the murder itself. Where I think I differ from you and a lot of people here is that showing evidence that AS appears to be lying about his involvement does not necessarily make him the killer. I mean Jay also appears to be lying about the extent of his involvement, but that doesn't make him the killer either. So, for me, the essence of the story looks like this: 1. Jay may be lying about the extent of his involvement in the murder itself 2. Adnan appears to be lying about his involvement in the murder and/or burial and/or car ditching 3. But the where, when and how of the murder are almost completely unknown, making it virtually impossible to rule out Adnan or Jay as killer, since we have reason to believe that both are lying	20141201T174521
anonymous	2	0	I agree if I add in untestable assimptions and forget the fact that there's no way to rule out Jay as killer, I'd definitely convict Adnan too. The idea of guilt that can't be proven doesn't come easy to me	20141129T005059
anonymous	1	0	Interesting. Actually, if Adnan came clean, and said something like, OK, OK, I knew what the hell was going on, here is what happened, then I could start thinking of some other plausible scenario, but he never gave it (as far as I know) and he still won't give it. For me, at this stage, it is impossible for me to rule out Adnan *and* Jay as *both* being involved in the murder.	20141201T210224

birdsofterrordise	0	0	"Welllll from my neuroscience coursework, THC generally does not have negative effects, but can cause paranoia is some. However! What I found more interesting was our professor going over with us how marijuana can exacerbate symptoms of schizophrenia (which shows itself in the teen/early adulthood) and he suspected from his research, it may instigate symptoms if you are predisposed (which is a very small portion of the population, but why it is preferable if you smoke to start when you are older or without THC.) Now, schizophrenia does not lead to being violent (in fact, many victims of abuse are those with mental health disorders), but paranoia, reality distortions? Not totally unlikely, I feel. (My professor also believes this exacerbation of schizophrenic symptoms may be what ""inspired"" the idea of reefer madness, since our understanding our mental health was so minimal at the time.)"	20141128T033548

By this time, he’d fired Christina Gutierrez over the Asia letters and he’s being represented by a public defender he doesn’t really know. Adnan tells the guy he wants to tell the court he did not kill Hae and that he is going to continue to fight this until the end...Adnan’s attorney then addresses the court. “Your honor, I would ask that this honorable court, if it would consider this case more a crime of passion than of intent to kill.”...The judge, Wanda Heard, disagreed with Adnan’s attorney at sentencing.	20141128T032920

So, that's outside my experience, though I don't dispute it could happen. It's just that there isn't any evidence that Adnan was a self-loathing homophobe trying to protect his reputation. There's evidence that people thought he was nice and personable and was interested in and pursued girls. I just think if he did it, rejection by an ex-girlfriend is probably more likely in the circumstances. There is zero evidence to indicate he was or is gay. No offence, but the theory just reads like a lazy script writing device from some TV drama, like the Mentalist, rather than anything based on what we know about these people.	20141128T231047

serialist9	5	0	In the U.S., once you've been convicted, new evidence generally isn't enough to free you unless it's something really irrefutable like DNA.

Kingfisher-Zero	3	0	"If new evidence comes to light, then the appeals process in the US is the same as far as I can tell. It's not referred to as ""unsafe"", but it sounds the same. The issue here is that nothing that's being thrown around ""came to light"" since the trial. There are things which perhaps were not presented to the jury as strongly as many would like, but that was a (arguably horrible) strategic decision by the defense. You can't get a new trial just so you can try a different defensive strategy with the same set of facts. That's why the Dierdre from the Innocence Project episode alluded to the fact that (paraphrasing) ""You don't HAVE to prove someone else did it...but I always tell someone you have to prove someone else did it."""	20141128T044525
I_W_N_R	3	0	Jury verdicts are given pretty extraordinary deference here in the US. The grounds on which you can overturn them are pretty limited - from your description, it's a much higher standard than in the UK. When it comes to new evidence, it has to do more than cast doubt on your conviction, it basically has to prove your innocence. If it's evidence the the prosecution knew about but withheld from the defense, then it something closer to the UK standard.	20141128T053734

The fact that Adnan knew going into sentencing (according to SK) that this would be his sentence strongly suggests that there was such a ""mandatory"" provision.

cbr1965	0	0	In the absence of any other evidence, the cell towers are gold. Since the police didn't search Jay's house, process other evidence or compare DNA from anyone other than Adnan, the cell logs are just about the only actual evidence that exists. Adnan is not tied to the body by forensics or anything other than Jays's word and the fact he used to date Hae. The entire case is purely based on hearsay from Jay on what he said happened. Telling a coherent story using Jay, Jenn and the call logs was the prosecutor's only choice. Reading Susan's cell phone timeline post on LL2, I find it pretty compelling evidence.	20141128T221113

Never been in trouble besides this case, not even in the 15 years he's been in prison. Jay on the other hand has multiple domestic violence charges against him. However I don't think you can gather a whole lot from a lack of domestic violence history with Adnan. Most 17 year olds don't have a domestic violence history. Hae was his first girlfriend and she ended up dead and he ended up in jail so there was never an opportunity for him to acquire a domestic violence history	20141128T132527
MusicCompany	2	0	One pertinent point is that the nature of Adnan and Hae's relationship constrained the amount of time they spent together. They didn't live together, and the time they spent together was seriously hampered by the fact that they had to hide their relationship from their families. It's just something to take into account.	20141128T182445

goliath_franco	5	0	"From the linked article, it looks like at least some of the risk factors either definitely were present or could have been present: * ""your partner threatens to hurt you, the children, or pets"": If Jay's account is true, Adnan threatened to hurt Hae. * ""Coercive control ... is long-term and tyranical abuse that includes, often in addition to physical violence, attacks on a woman's self-worth, degrading remarks and *obsessive monitoring of her whereabouts and her contact with other people*"" (emphasis added): According to Hae's friend, Adnan constantly paged Hae when she was with her own friends and would show up when Hae was spending time with her own friends. * ""He's obsessively possessive. If he can't have her, no one can."": This might have been present depending on your interpretation of the note. * ""He drinks or uses drugs."": Adnan himself admits to smoking marijuana regularly. But one of the (potentially key) risk factors, physical abuse, is missing. The article doesn't talk about which factors are more or less important, though, so we can't really know whether it is important that physical abuse was a missing risk factor."	20141128T051420
anonymous	3	0	Oh, please. None of us knew this girl. We only have her diary and the descriptions of her that her friends offered. I see nothing -- nothing at all -- that suggests she was likely to become a DV victim. There was no abuse to dismiss. No evidence from her diary that she was afraid or freaked out, not evidence from her friends that anything was off, no evidence (except from the ever-truthful Jay) that Adnan was ever angry with her even for a moment. It's so disrespectful to Hae to put this victim stuff on her. She was a teenager with a full life, a bright future, and a strong personality. She fell in love twice in the space of a year, and from all accounts of those who were close to her, she was doing just fine. Read her letter to Adnan . . . she wasn't afraid of him, she was *annoyed.* I'm among the oldest people on this crazy sub, and I've seen plenty of actual, disgusting, hideous DV shit in my life. This stuff no way no how rings any warning bells. No one is dismissing abuse because there wasn't any abuse. Not one instance of Hae saying she was creeped out, or uneasy, or anything remotely indicative that Adnan was trying to run her life or push her around. To the OP: good article, thanks for linking.	20141128T061649
anonymous	1	0	"My point is that there does not seem to be adequate evidence that there was any abuse, let alone abuse that would lead to premeditated, cold-blooded, unprecedented murder. Also, not all of the ""red flags"" can be disproven because Hae was an ""emotional teenage girl."" I'm not trying to weaken her or dismiss her in any way. But I am saying that their behavior seems to be very normal for teenagers. I did stuff like that. My friends did stuff like that. If wanting to hang out with your highschool sweetheart all the time is abusive, then we've all been abusive."	20141128T053811
anonymous	2	0	"* *If* Jay's account is true, yes. But it's so full of holes that I choose not to believe most of it. And this post is mostly about non-Jay evidence. * The second one is a little tricky - but I'd urge you to look back on your highschool relationships. When I was in high school, I texted my boyfriend about 5 times each hour (and that was me trying to hold back). I asked him to hang out every day. I wanted to see him, talk to him, and know what he was up to *alllllll* the time. I think that's pretty typical for kids. The key to this kind of obsessive monitoring is that it's generally done without the participation, consent, or enjoyment of the other party. It really seemed from what we know about Hae that she's probably also going to be texting her bf all the time too. Also, the only people who reported having a problem with this were Hae's friends - and they called it annoying, not creepy. I think there's a fine line here between obsessive and normal, but I felt like Adnan was on the normal side of the line. * Your third point is up in the air - if you think he's guilty, this seems obvious. If you think he's not, then it doesn't really seem present (and this is my overall point here - the ""signs of abuse here"" are only being pointed out by people who already believe in Adnan's guilt; I don't think anyone would be bothered by this if we didn't think he was a murder suspect). * Smoking pot is NOT a sign of abuse."	20141128T060905
goliath_franco	5	0	"In your OP, you write, ""So, at least as I see it, there isn't really evidence of an abusive dynamic between Hae and Adnan before her murder."" I don't think that's true. There is at least some evidence that risk factors for murder were present. We can question the evidence, but I don't think your post actually works in Adnan's favor. I'm not sure it works against him either. We basically have the same evidence we did before, and we're still stuck interpreting it. Is Jay reliable? What does Hae's letter mean? How do we interpret Adnan's frequently paging Hae? And so on. Responding to individual points: * Yes, that's why I wrote ""if Jay's account is true""; I recognize that Jay's version of events is disputed. * You write, ""I think there's a fine line here between obsessive and normal, but I felt like Adnan was on the normal side of the line."" That's fine. I'm not asserting that this risk factor absolutely was present. We don't even have very good definitions of these risk factors (because the definitions come from a general media article instead of a scientific report). But we do have some evidence that it was present. * Again, this is open to interpretation, but clearly from Hae's perspective Adnan was not taking the break up well. She writes, ""Your life is NOT going to end. You'll move on and I'll move on. But apparently you don't respect me enough to respect my decision. ... I seriously DID expect you to accept [my decision] ... I NEVER wanted to end this like this, so hostile & cold."" It seems clear that Adnan did not want to let Hae go. I don't even think it matters whether his reaction was normal or abnormal. The risk factor is defined as being present or absent. * What's the basis for disputing this point? The article says ""drug use"" not abuse. Adnan clearly smoked a lot of pot; he says so himself."	20141128T063755
anonymous	0	0	Again, it sounds like you're saying that being a feminist means automatically buying any allegation of abuse, even ones based on pretty shoddy evidence by people who never knew either of the people in question. That's ridiculous.	20141128T063122
anonymous	1	0	Look, I'm really sorry that my comments here have upset you. As you've seen from my posting history, I am a feminist. I have *many* friends and loved ones who've been in abusive relationships - too many. But I've also been a 17-year-old in love, and I know how I used to talk about and to my boyfriend. I could have written everything in Hae's diary, and I could have written that letter to Adnan - even though none of my boyfriends have ever been abusive. My point is that, while it's possible to see Adnan as abusive if you already think he's guilty, that letter looks like nothing if you don't.	20141128T054442
anonymous	0	0	"Here's the thing - if one believes that Adnan is guilty, it's easy to read abuse into his past relationship with Hae (this makes sense, since, like I say in my post, there's pretty much always abuse before murder, so if he did murder her, he probably abused her). But, if one believes (as I do) that Adnan is probably innocent, then the ""evidence of abuse seems like it isn't evidence of anything at all. And I've been seeing people saying that the ""abuse"" in the note & in the friend's reports is *proof* of the fact that her murdered her. So I think it's worthwhile to point out the ways that this ""evidence"" doesn't indicate abuse. The whole point is that while it is possible to use this stuff as proof of his guilt, it's also possible to claim that it's not proof of guilt at all."	20141128T064902
goliath_franco	4	0	I'm not getting your approach. * Your post argues that there are risk factors that predict murder in romantic relationships. (I accept this point.) * Your post also argues that absent these risk factors, murder is very unlikely or rare. (I can accept this for the sake of argument; I'm not entirely sure whether it's true.) * And you post argues that because risk factors for murder are absent in Adnan's and Hae's relationship, Adnan is unlikely to have murdered her. (Here, the point I disagree with is that risk factors for murder are absent. We know that at least one, drug use, was definitely present, and others may have been.) I do agree with you that Hae's letter is not *proof* that Adnan murdered her. I regard the letter as evidence suggesting he had a motive to do it. It's not even definitive proof that he even had a motive in my opinion. But I don't think your post resolves anything as far as what the evidence shows. It definitely doesn't dispel these pieces of evidence (e.g., Hae's letter). We're still left with the original task of interpreting those pieces of evidence (e.g., what does Hae's letter say about the end of their relationship, how Adnan thought of Hae, and whether Adnan might have wanted to hurt Hae?) p.s. Just want to say that I haven't downvoted you.	20141128T065934
anonymous	2	0	I said it was implausible, not impossible. They're different things. And you are really, *really* twisting my post and my words. I'm NOT saying that he wasn't abusive because she's emotional, I'm saying that the parts of her note that people are saying indicate abuse are part of a larger pattern of a dramatic writing style. For example, in an edit to the post, I added that she wrote in her diary that she was mad at Adnan because he took a couple of hours to return her message - to the point where she was going to start a fight. If I (as I am right now) wrote a note to a boyfriend like the one she wrote to Adnan, it might be a serious red flag. If I (as I was when I was 17) wrote a note like that to a boyfriend, it would be par for the course.	20141128T064032

anonymous	0	0	ok, we each interpret these events differently. But are you really saying that there's *no scenario* in which he would have shown up at her parties, and *no scenario* in which she could have written that note that *doesn''t* involve abuse? Because like I said, I did things like that when I was young, and so did many of my friends, and I really don't think any of us were abusive or being abused.	20141128T054847
anonymous	0	0	"I guess what I'm trying to get at is that many people *are* seeing Adnan's ""abuse"" of Hae as proof that he murdered her. I see that you're not doing that, but I've seen people list that as evidence (especially since it's the closes we can seem to get to a real motive). And (after having a really long conversation with my roommate about it this evening) I wanted to make a post explaining why it's not certain (or perhaps even probable) that the relationship was abusive in the first place. So that would *significantly* lessen the alleged motive he would have had for killing her. For example, the letter suggests that they may have been arguing that winter - that's a reasonable conclusion, and it would be relevant in forming a motive. But I've seen people say that the letter *proves* that he was abusing her, and therefore *strongly* implicates him in her murder. And I'm trying to explain why (IMO) that's not the best interpretation of it. Also, thanks for letting me know it wasn't you. FWIW, I'm not downvoting you either, in case it needed to be said. I have to say, it's a bummer to be systematically downvoted like this."	20141128T070722
anonymous	0	0	The prosecution's entire case rests on the idea that Jay's motive was his jealousy and anger (i.e. abusive tendencies) towards abuse. If he did kill Hae, particularly for these reasons, it would be an instance of domestic violence. And I'm saying that this motive doesn't make sense, because there's not sufficient evidence that he was abusive towards her. Domestic abuse is not improbable at all. But murder of a domestic partner with no precedent of physical abuse, and no *convincing* evidence of emotional abuse is *highly* improbable. I feel like you're saying that if I don't see this as abuse, and if I don't see Adnan as a killer, then I'm a bad feminist. And that's really not fair.	20141128T055746

I don't see how you could be. Again, the whole point is that the note is not, in my interpretation of it, *proof* of Adnan's motive. It can be twisted to correlate with the image of Adnan as murderer (""see, he paged her a lot, so he must have killed her!), but I'm saying that it's really easy to read it the other way as well, and therefore it's not hard evidence."	20141128T062932
anonymous	1	0	And Jay lied about a lot of stuff. My WHOLE point with this post is that there are no signs of abuse that anyone would notice if they didn't already think Adnan was a bad guy.

anonymous	1	0	Ok, so you're retroactively seeing his behavior pre-murder as abusive, not because it's obvious abuse, but because it fits with your narrative. The thing is, I totally get that. That's what everyone who has an opinion about the show has to do. I see his behavior as non-abuse in part because I believe that he's innocent. But do you not see how unfair it is to call me a bad feminist when even you have to admit that the note and the friend's recollections aren't clear (or even strong) evidence of abuse?	20141128T063650
anonymous	1	0	If Hae had called Adnan abusive, I wouldn't question her. That's the whole point here - I'm not minimizing anything she said, because she *never indicated* that he was abusive or that she was disappointed, scared, or unhappy with the relationship.	20141128T061733

You can trace a trail. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSE7eQRgJ9c&feature=youtu.be Someone drove up to the high school, waited by the school for her to leave and either she stopped on her own, to get gas maybe, or someone could have paged her and she stopped to use a payphone. She was intercepted and the 4:12 call pinged in the Forest Park area because they were driving south away from the area of the daycare to hide her car. Just one thought outside of the weed scenario.	20141128T073056

The way he talked about the spot being a place where drug deals take place, etc. In his story Adnan would have been in another car and they wouldn't have been able to have a discussion about the pros and cons of various places to park the car. Adnan wasn't a dealer so he wouldn't have known about the row houses being a good car dump spot. I don't buy that Adnan would have led Jay to this spot at all. It seemed pretty obvious to me that Jay was calling on his own experience when he made the judgement call to park Hae's car there.	20141128T110838

mke_504	5	0	Fair enough, but that doesn't mean she wasn't just as fooled as anyone else. Obviously Jay tells a very convincing story that happens to include quite a lot of lies.	20141128T065036
anonymous	2	0	Well maybe but Cathy also talked about how strange she thought Jay behaved too. Maybe he left her out for his own benefit as well. And what's with this crazy nauseating cigarette Jay gives Adnan's before the go to Cathy's?	20141128T071007
mrmiffster	9	0	Yeah, I mean if you can convince a woman to stay with you after you have admitted to being an accomplice in the cover up of her best friend's murder you are a MASTER manipulator. Just by that alone I know that Jay is successful at being manipulative.	20141128T110056
MusicCompany	5	0	If you don't smoke cigarettes regularly, they can easily make you feel nauseated. Especially considering that, according to Jay's story (and, I might add, an extremely telling detail), Adnan threw up later.	20141128T165713

anonymous	1	0	I agree with u/segovius. The fact that Juwan testifies to police that he and Adnan used to smoke there implies that he and Jay also used to smoke there. And it probably seemed like a believably secluded place to put the crime, especially after Jay's confirmed that there are no cameras there. Which makes sense, because this version doesn't enter *his* narrative until two weeks after his initial testimony, which would afford him the time he needs to follow-up and confirm that this would work.	20141128T182554
soamx	3	0	It's weird because he says he doesn't remember giving Jay his phone after 6pm. This is weird whether he is guilty or innocent If he's guilty, you would think he would want to say Jay still had the phone as it's plausible from the call log and it frees him from being in Leakin Park that night. During a time when he actually has an alibi with witnesses (Mosque) so if he's guilty and telling all these lies- why not tell the most beneficial lie of all? If he's innocent, then he didn't have his phone and he should remember giving it to Jay. They are the most important calls in the call log-whoever had the cel phone was burying Hae at that time. I think it's plausible that Adnan wasn't there- but it certainly doesn't look good for him that he doesn't say he gave Jay the phone again	20141128T122212

SerialClaireS	2	0	"I think it's totally possible he just left it in his car, it might not have been a formal conversation about lending the phone. If he was going into the mosque, I could see leaving your cell phone in the car anyway. I also agree if he was high,( and completely unaware of how important it would be to remember this choice weeks later), it's reasonable he wouldn't remember. Also just a theory, but maybe Jay knew he needed it & had it tucked away so it would be less likely for Adnan to see it and be like ""oh ya, I should take this"". Or also likely, if he was still loaning out his car, maybe he wanted a way to reach Jay when he wanted to be picked up."	20141128T160558
readybrek	1	0	He thinks he does have the phone. The phone calls actually seem to imply Jay has the phone between 7pm and 9pm but that's not what Adnan remembers so he doesn't say it. What I would have been interested in is where does he actually think the phone is? Does he keep his phone on his person if he hasn't lent it to Jay? Or would it be in the glove box of his unlocked car parked near the mosque? One of many questions the police did not appear to have bothered asking.	20141129T133816

anonymous	2	0	Jay could be involved worth another crime, something bigger and unrelated, either as a witness or a perp or whatever. This bigger crime has him involved with the cops and, by chance, Hae's murder goes down. The cops then get the anonymous tip off (or facilitate it) and use Jay to wrap it up and put it to bed in the shortest time with the least expenditure of resources. Adnan goes down and Jay is free (according to the deal he cut) but he is still in the frame with the bigger crime/case which necessitates he continue with the agreed Adnan story or else the bigger issue falls apart. He would be more than a co-conspirator in such a case, he'd almost be a quasi-cop.	20141128T093030
noble-lobel	2	0	"His lies and inconsistencies suggest a consciousness of guilt beyond what he was admitted to. He told the cops everything about the crime up to ""it was me"" and ""I was there when she was killed.""

Nutbrowndog	12	0	I agree except after reading Jay's transcript (last night--am late to the game) I think that Jay just didn't really believe Adnan would go through with it. I think he and Jenn thought it was trash talk. Jay clearly states in his interview that something changed in Adnan on Jan. 13--that suddenly he thought Adnan might be capable and when he told Jenn this she just blew it off that Adnan was just a weird f*ing dude. It's heartbreaking really, that they didn't take him seriously and then of course once it happened that they both didn't tell but it makes sense to me that if they didn't believe Adnan they would have been shocked and now afraid and having to cover it up. I think you are right in that Jay's lies all correspond with trying NOT to implicate people whom Jay had been with that day, some of whom knew before or after or just were in the unfortunate position of having been within proximity to either Jay or Adnan. The rest of Jay's story stays the same and the details are so real, disturbing and ring true. People should have stood up and come forward. What is wrong with everybody???	20141129T180309
pennyparade	8	0	This is great! Just what I'd been thinking but way more detailed. Thanks for the work! I don't understand why more people don't realize that Jay's lies make sense; they minimize his involvement, they hide other crimes, they keep his friends out of it, etc.	20141129T233511
filmscore2	13	0	"Well done!! After thoroughly reading Jay and Jenn's testimony, this is pretty much the same exact sequence of events I independently came up with as well (and was gonna post it myself but you beat me to it!!). yes, the 2:36 call was probably from the school. And, it was the 3:15 call that Adnan was telling Jay he was done with the murder (and maybe Jay physically helped him move the body to the trunk or something and that's why Jay wanted to avoid telling the police originally that it happened at Best Buy ""because there were cameras""). Also, the other reason Jay lies so much is because in this scenario, Jay definitely has foreknowledge about the murder. So, maybe he didn't actually help with the murder but the fact that he actually knew the murder was gonna actually happen (not just Adnan B.S.ing about killing her) makes it more likely Jay was covering his ass a little more because if he really did know specifically it was gonna happen in advance, he's a co-conspirator in a murder, and not just an accessory after the fact. Now, one possibly contradictory thing about that 3:15 call is that the cell phone (probably) is not at Jenn's house but is nearer to the Best Buy Parking Lot (which probably does mean Jay was on his way already--or maybe he stopped at McDonald's himself or something). And, then, yes, there really is no time there to move the car right after the murder (based on the cell phone records), so the car probably stayed in the Best Buy Parking Lot and they came back and got it after track practice. This also explains why, after they got the call at Cathy's house, they really realized they had to take care of this quick (get rid of Hae's car) [and Kathy's testimony states they were talking, after getting the call from the detective, ""what should I do?""] https://viewfromll2.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/kathy-testimony.png If Hae's car is really sitting in the Best Buy Parking Lot, it could get found relatively quickly. Also, regarding the Nisha call, rather than assuming it was a butt-dial (which, while possible, doesn't seem to have been proposed to happen any other time), why don't we just assume, that, yes, it was an actual call, which is the more obvious answer! Just because Nisha can't remember doesn't mean it didn't happen. And, she may have conflated two separate calls (the later one at the video store), or maybe she just after the fact somehow the video store information got conflated in there and she did remember the actual call. Either way, if you don't start with any bias as to which side you are on, the more OBVIOUS explanation of a call to Nisha is that it did happen. But, proving Adnan's guilt is not contingent on it happening anyways, but it's just another piece of evidence in favor. One more thing. A lot of Jay's lies (not all of them) seem to be aimed at keeping other people out of the story (the guys he picked pot up from, Kathy). So, in his first interview, he tries to leave them out of it so they don't get involved. But, then eventually he does have to tell the truth and bring them into his story. So, that helps explain a lot of Jay's lies (but not all of them). Like, he added the whole Patascapo trip or whatever to avoid having to talk about going to pick up weed at his friend's places. Anyways, to the original poster, I think your scenario is one that very plausibly incorporates all the different sources and info and makes the best sense of them!"	20141128T190008
reddit1101	9	0	"Explanations cont. Why Jay said he first saw the body at the intersection near Leakin, then conceded it was Best Buy- Jay was trying to minimize his involvement. He wasn't sure there were security cameras at BB so he lied about the location in the case that this potential tape might be damning for him. It would show that he met with Adnan knowingly, saw the dead body, made some calls, acted normal, and then drove off with Adnan for track practice. No alerting the police, completely going along with the crime as planned. Why Jay didn't go to the police after the crime- He knew he was deeply, deeply associated with a homicide first degree murder and was afraid of the consequences. He was also afraid of Adnan hurting Stephanie, his girlfriend who he cared deeply for. Adnan allegedly made threats of this to Jay and at that point, he knew what Adnan was capable of. Jay also wanted to protect his friends Jenn, Cathy and drug dealers. They were just helping him out/unaware of their involvement and didn't want to bring them down with him or they bring him down. ***Why Adnan did not make a big deal about Asia and the library until later-*** At the beginning of his arrest, Adnan didn't know how things were going to go for sure. He didn't know for certain the prosecution's timeline. The library is in fact where he committed the murder - he would NOT want to be placed there. He ignores the letter at that time. When it is clear that Best Buy is going to be the place of the crime, and they're staying with this, then it is reconsidered and that was now their main argument. He suddenly has an ""alibi"". Apparently, they pushed it so much on Asia that somehow she didn't want to be involved. Jenn's involvement- Jenn was his accomplice, just as he was an accomplice to Adnan. He told Jenn what was about to happen and then told her what happened, then asked her to help him get out of it (mainly by picking him up when he needed and agreeing to match his story). Jenn knew as early as a few days before the actual murder, well before picking him up at WV mall post 8pm on the 13th, what was about to happen. Jay mentions this in his second interview. He later takes this back saying they both didn't know until the day of - because otherwise it would be premeditated murder. Jay tells Jenn Adnan's detailed plan when she comes home from work on Jan 13. They do nothing to stop it. Perhaps Jay thought Adnan had enough dirt on him to send him to jail or that Adnan would hurt Stephanie/his relationship or Jay was getting paid or he just thought it was cool. Whatever the case may be, this was a horrible decision. While he's at Jenn's waiting, appx 1-130p, Adnan called Jenn's LAN-line one time Jay stated. This may be the call when Adnan tells him to head toward the school and be ready for his call after (that's why during the short 2:36 call Jay is near the school, awaiting confirmation). They both knew it was going to happen after school but it got pushed back half hour because Hae had to talk to Summer after school, etc and then Hae was suppose to meet Adnan at the library ""at their spot"". Say that Hae got to the library at 2:50-3:00, that's still enough time to pick up her cousin at 3:30. She could have left at 3:20 and still make it in time. That is why she agreed to give Adnan a ride to his car. Why bury the body/how the body may have been found by Mr. S- It was premeditated. He knew he'd be driving her car afterwards. In his 17-18 year old mind, he's got to make it look like a random murder/disappearance. And hope her body never gets discovered. He didn't think it through very much. But most first time perpetrators don't. His plan was to ""get rid of the body"", and it ended up in the park. His plan for the car was ""to abandon it"", since he and Jay are on the move and he can't be seen in her car, they decide by the park is fine. I actually think because Leakin Park is known for dead bodies that Adnan didn't expect her body to be found. Even if it was a shallow grave. I'm going to be really macabre here but somewhere on reddit I read that Jay told the police Adnan wanted to visit Hae's body on more than one occasion. Jay declined. This is classic serial killer behavior. They want to return to the scene of the crime, the burial site, and do who knows what. Jay really has no reason to bring this little fact up, other than it's something Adnan really said. Jay also said Adnan was very specific where he wanted to bury her (a place Adnan and Hae used to have sex). Maybe the reason the grave was only 6 inches deep was so he could return to Hae's body. Mr. S may have seen Adnan in the park. The $1.71 credit card purchase- This purchase I believe was Hae right after school getting a snack which she did every day, according to the snack lady. This lady says she definitely saw Hae after school. My guess is the charge is from the snack place but is owned by the same vendor as the gas station so it shows up as the gas station. I do not think Hae was at the gas station 11 miles away. Another explanation is this charge happened the day/night before but showed up on the bank records later. Why Adnan can't admit it now- He's been lying this long, why would he give it up now? What benefit would he get? It would cause more pain. He still has a small chance with his appeals. Why risk that? Also, people keep secrets buried and hidden for years, it's very possible he'll never admit to it. He's been bold face lying to his loved ones, his family, for over a decade. He has a community behind him and a group of supporters who send him money, visit him, etc. To come out now, would be too much. There would be too much guilt and shame. You could look at it as protecting his close ones from finding out the sad, tragic truth. It's too heinous and damaging to his superior identity."	20141128T211549
DonnaCappaG	4	0	I would love to see the same timeline only the version where Jay kills Hae all by himself. His motive is that he doesn't want Hae to tell Stephanie that he was stepping out on her. Has anyone done that yet? I'm not saying I think it went down like that but it would be nice to see.	20141129T195102
anonymous	5	0	"I agree with almost all of this of course. So many people have been spending weeks arguing with the cops' timeline and with Jay's trial testimony as if that is what might have happened, when **we all know this is not what happened**. The 6:59 (to Adnan's acquaintance) and the 7:00 (to Jay's acquaintance) are the big ones for me. They clearly imply that A&J are together and are *up to something* together. I have never heard anyone satisfactorily explain the proximity of these two calls. Then we have the big 7:09. I actually don't buy the ""Adnan picked up and said Jay's busy"" - this is the cops talking to place Adnan at the burial or Jen saying what they want to hear. It's completely unnecessary. Adnan is there alright (or they'll be there soon). This is the call where Jay tells Jen to meet him later."	20141128T125308

Ed. The 7:15 call. And upvoted, great job.	20141129T183636
Kellygirll	2	0	I forgot until I just read this, but I also noticed that Adnan did not call Hae after her disappearance which seemed very weird to me. It seemed he would want to try to reach her if he thought she was just out messing around, as other people did. He called her at midnight the night before, so Had seemingly would have been his first call after the police called to question him, right? Or am I mising som thing?	20141222T014648
Kellygirll	2	0	Does anyone think that the anonymous tip phone call to the police Came from Jay? That's somehing I felt was likely. In one of Jay's interviews he says he was present for a call Adnan made to someone (Tyad) and A said he killed someone. In the second anonymous call, the caller says to talk to one of Adnan's friends (I don't remember the name give though) because he might know something. Also in an interview, Jay says a friend of Adnan talks about how great it is inPakistan	20141222T020343

Glitteranji	1	0	It woukd be uo tonthe person praying to have turned off or silenced their phone or pager :) I only meant that he could have called him even if they were planning to meet there, because as of the point mentioned above as to why he would call someone he'd be seeing soon at any minute -- if Adnan were outside, he wouldn't know if his friend were still at home, inside, wher at, or whatever, because it's not like milling around shaking hands as everone enters to be seated at roughly the same time.	20141130T052225
WannabeAttorney	1	0	This timeline seems pretty plausible. Thanks for sharing it. I've also thought about the 2:36 call as merely Adnon calling Jay from the library to check in. This better aligns with Jenn's account (she said Jay was at her house until 3:45 or so) and with Asia's account (she said she talked to Adnan in the library around 2:40 to 3:00 approximately). But I have two questions related to this 2:36-3:15 portion of the timeline: 1. Is the library parking lot a conceivable place to carry out the crime (i.e., was it secluded enough for Adnan to risk committing the crime in this location)? Or would it make more sense for Adnan to have Hae drive him to the Best Buy parking lot still? My guess is the rear of a Best Buy parking lot at 3:00 or so in the afternoon would be much less crowded than a library near school at that time. 2. Isn't it odd that Asia seems to remember the library interaction fairly well, but she doesn't remember Adnan seeming distracted? If Adnan was planning on killing Hae in the parking lot of that library, wouldn't he have seemed off to her? Granted, if he were planning on killing Hae anywhere that day, he probably should have seemed off. But if a person were going to commit the crime then and there, I would think that person would be noticeably unsocial and off-putting in that moment. This makes me think that either (a) Adnan was not planning on committing the crime on the library grounds, or (b) Adnan is such a psychopath that he was able to pleasantly socialize for an extended period of time right before doing so.	20141227T040344

Regardless, Jay says he and Jenn were in the know the night before. I can't be sure why they didn't go to the police. Adnan had dirt on him and Jay didn't care for the law (he also may have been mad at Hae for trying to tell Stephanie Jay cheated on her). In any case, they all had a hand in Hae's murder."	20141129T231049
reddit1101	9	0	Thanks for your comment. I agree with all of the points you make. Our theories definitely align! I really came into this without a bias and tried to maintain that throughout my research. I heard the testimonies and stuck with the facts - the cell phone call logs. What could we make sense of here? What is, as you said, the most obvious answer? For me, in the end, the case against Adnan's story was too strong. The motive was there. The calls only he would make they were there. He didn't have a strong alibi, at all. His behavior wasn't right. There were witnesses to his asking for a ride that morning. The timing of everything... it was just too much for coincidence. He wasn't able to be sure of anything. As Sarah Koenig said, wouldn't the day become so clear to you after the police called? He wasn't even sure he went to the mosque... after police called. Cathy, who had no reason to indict him, said he said things and behaved in a way that was just not normal for anyone. Even listening to the podcast, it's sometimes difficult to listen to him because for me the verdict is clear. He is good at speaking, at manipulating, and planting that seed of doubt. His good behavior and wit makes it difficult not to believe him. But, just because you're an achiever, just because you're charming, just because you come from a religious family, just because you didn't have a wrap sheet, just because your case was intriguing, doesn't mean you didn't commit a crime. So keep your minds clear.	20141128T224520
blancnoise	5	0	But what about the $1.71 charge Hae made at a gas station 30 mins away from school on 1/13? Apparently this information is in the court transcripts. Also, some interesting reading here using the same timeline of phone call logs http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/23/serial-a-comparison-of-adnans-cell-phone-records-and-the-witness-statements-provided-by-adnan-jay-jenn-and-cathy/ and including Jay's four different versions of where the trunk pop occurred. If Jay thought there were cameras at Best Buy, wouldnt that have worked in his favour, as it would actually show Adnan being there at Best Buy, post murder, and also be time stamped, corroborating Jay's version of events.	20141130T111234
donailin1	9	0	Yaknow, this is excellent, and while I was reading I had sort of an epiphany about the whole thing. Perhaps after years, Adnan wants if nothing else, to drag Jay down in his little hell. I don't care how devout a Muslim one becomes in prison, after 15 years you get hardened, you become wise beyond your years. Prison is Prison, and it's as political a place as DC only with rape and violence. Even if one were to avoid the horrors, you witness them, you hear them, you hear about them. You must choose a group almost from day one. You must align yourself with others for protection. Maybe Adnan would like his revenge on Jay. Maybe he feels Jay needs to be punished, and what better way than crowdsourcing -- Adnan is still above many things, highly intelligent and somewhat up to date on the world outside prison, thanks to Rabia. I mean Jay's full name was published in WaPo yesterday and now making it's rounds here across the globe. If Jay went about his life unnoticed all this time, well not anymore. I bet Adnan is delighted. Just a thought. ed. clarity.	20141129T184830
anonymous	3	0	I agree with your theory with the exception being Adnan hired Jay to kill Hae based on Jay's rep as being part of the criminal element at school. Seriously, why would you get involved?

I think your second theory is better than the snack stand. I was a teenager with a debit card in 1999. Places that would not take cards included Taco Bell, movie theaters, and the school cafeteria. Also, I think back then you ALWAYS needed to sign for credit. It seems unlikely that the snack stand was able to take credit. My guess is a delayed entry at the gas station.	20141220T230406
urbanbk	2	0	Great theory. I'm new to Serial so I've taken in an loads of information in a short space of time. As much as I'd like to think that Adnan didn't do it I've come to the following conclusions:- A) The case against him was really weak and shouldn't have gone to court. B) The prosecutions timeline is incorrect C) Jay was probably more complicit in the murder / disposal of the body than he's letting on. I don't buy the story that Adnan threatened his girlfriend. D) Adnan sadley did kill Hae either alone or with someone else there. I'm sure all of my thoughts and theories will change in the next week but this is where I'm at at the moment.:) The biggest act of guilt against him for me is that he didn't attempt to call / page Hae after he allegedly thought she'd gone missing.	20141208T173316

reddit1101	6	0	The only person that vouches for him at the mosque is his father. No one else remembers seeing or talking with him. I do think the call at 7:16p is his mother at the mosque looking for him. Adnan himself can't explain where he was at 7-8p. During a call with Sarah Koenig, I remember him not being sure to this day. He says he probably would have been dropping food off for his father at the mosque because it was Ramadan. Wouldn't he already be at prayer?	20141129T230412

But if he called just as he was at the mosque, or he was at the mosque, when and how does Jay get the phone back to him by 9:01. Does Jay call in at the Mosque and look inside for him (Adnan now has no cell)? Does Jay call into Adnan's house and give the cell back to him - maybe Jay dropped food off at the mosque and went back home. But surely, surely, surely, surely, surely, surely, in a day of incredible surelys, Adnan would remember either of these two events. If his life depended on it!	20141130T092915

That someone on the line, he thinks his mom, spoke in Arabic/Urdu and Adnan replied in a mix of both English and Arabic/Urdu. As someone who grew up with two languages, this is a common occurrence.

I am simply stating my opinion/theory as everyone is entitled to on this subreddit. That is the point of reddit to discuss thoughts, ideas, and post questions. This is not a place to be accusatory or negative. What is your theory? I do not have any disrespect to his family - that is ridiculous and quiet insulting. I feel sorry for all families involved as I stated in my post. I feel bad for Adnan as well. This was a tragedy all around, a sad story. You can assume whatever you want about me having a bias but I didn't come into story thinking, I know nothing about this case but there is just absolutely no way whoever this is about is innocent. Makes zero sense. It was a clean slate. I have not one reason to be bias. In fact, I didn't form a theory until I started the timeline - I couldn't. I was going back and forth well into the episodes. My *theory* is not without careful thought and logical reasoning - and I'm not alone. If my opinion doesn't align with yours, do you have to be negative about it? Isn't that being bias? I do not have anything personal against Adnan. I didn't know him personally. But I don't have to know someone to form an opinion on what I think happened, based on the facts of the call log and statements made. It's better that many of us don't know him because that would cloud our judgement. I never made a claim that I can 100% prove he did it. That's impossible. But just because I can't doesn't mean he didn't do it. We're all just sharing theories and some are stronger than others, depending on the individual.	20141130T093630

Reading your comment, the first thing that came to mind was comments I've seen Rabia make (elsewhere) about how difficult it is to explain to Adnan how popular Serial has become. She said something to the effect of - how do you explain that something is trending on Twitter or what a hashtag is to someone who has never experienced social networking? So, I think that your suggestion is unlikely. Even if he were aware of such things, I think it would be highly unlikely that he would expect Serial to explode the way that it has.	20141130T012138

Glitteranji	1	0	I'm so sorry, that wasn't actually meant for you, I was addressing another poster /u/donailin1, I must have accidentally hit the wrong reply. That user has actually made snide remarks about Adnan's family and culture repeatedly on the subreddit, including a couple of long rants, and makes at least one reference to it in almost every comment. That poster has also made remarks specifically about his mother. What it amounts to is their theory is that Adnan is a murderer because he's a Muslim with backwards, controlling immigrant parents, and feels the need to say it over and over again. Then went and made a claim above about being biased, which I found laughable.	20141130T142308
Glitteranji	0	0	No, my point is that you are rude and bigoted and have no claim to being unbiased. The second point being that, if he is guilty, you can't blame it on his religion, culture, immigrant status, or his mother, FFS. If such were the case, then there would be many more similar murders by other similar background people, and you've yet to explain then all the hundreds of thousands of women in this country who are similarly murdered by people who do not share his background.	20141130T142611
RyanFielding	3	0	Not sure how much it actually matters but I'm not sold that he would be clueless about these technologies. Two reason: He stated that he has television, and also he certainly has a lot of free time to read. A few issues of Wired magazine from the library and he no doubt would be very well informed. If you've ever flipped through old tech magazines you know how fascinating it is to see the old tech we used to use, now just imagine if your only connection with the future tech was through the magazines, personally I would be very very keen to read and marvel at the changes. And actually as I think about it more, it occurs to me that he has a lot of visitors or correspondence from people his own age. Technology has become such a dominant part of our every waking hour that it seems very unlikely that his friends and visitors would be able to relate stories from their daily lives without also educating him on the technological advances of the present day. What good is it to tell your incarnated friend about the time your brother pranked you by setting up a Grinder profile on your iPhone if you don't first tell him about smartphones, the internet, and Grinder. Imagine trying to explain a Grinder prank without context to someone stuck in 1999.

And why does his Dad say he was at the mosque from 7:30 on (when, with all respect, he would have been very concerned about timings). Look I am not saying any of the scenarios you present are are not possible. They are possible (though not very plausible to me - that's just me). I am saying that the scenario that 2 calls are made, 1 to a guy to say he will *not* be at mosque, it's cool, let's keep going, is far more likely.	20141129T093546

It's not like everyone is standing outside the church doors waiting to enter the vestibule or whatever it's called for midnight mass or something. It's not an organized thing with a set time. People are just coming in and out all night long. Although he may run into a couple guys outside smoking or something, or pass others as they are coming in and out, most people who are there are already going to be inside in one of any number of places doing their own thing. Performing ablutions, praying, reading/reciting Quran, using their prayer beads (all individual activities), etc. Depending upon the size of the mosque, it's also not going to be that easy to find each other, especially if someone else is already inside praying in a row, several rows deep.	20141130T042800

blancnoise	1	0	Typically you'd expect people as a general courtesy to have their phones on silent as a ringing phone would disturb congregational prayer. I'm not saying I believe the following, but perhaps it could have been that prayers were meant to start at seven, give or take, and Adnan called Yaser to ask if prayers had started yet cos he wanted to be on time? Perhaps Yaser wasn't at the mosque and it was just a call to say I'm totally stoned, my folks expect me at the mosque tonight, do you have something that will help bring me down? Was Yaser interviewed? Or, maybe it was, I'm totally stoned, can you take the food my mum has prepared to the mosque (which doesnt necessarily prove that Adnan did not attend the mosque that evening). Generally the theory presented seems pretty plausible, but I just remember Cathy saying (episode 6) how stoned Adnan was. Was he too stoned to drive which according to this theory he needed to be able to do - driving Hae's car later that evening. Also, a macabre detail, but Jay said that Hae's lips were blue when Adnan first opened the trunk up. Given it was less than an hour since Adnan had allegedly killer her, would her lips have been blue?	20141130T102933
anonymous	1	0	OK thanks for the informative post. I'm stuck on the 6:59, 7:00 and 9:01. Regarding the blue lips, that is certainly macabre. Who knows what to believe with Jay.	20141201T064235

He has a family, friends and even fans that support him, visit him, write him etc. he wouldn't want to jeopardize losing that support.

prettikitti89	1	0	The two may not be mutually exclusive, particularly if Adnan has convinced himself he was justified.

anonymous	1	0	Sorry if I was unclear. I would think a part of being a Muslim in good faith would be cleansing yourself of sin.

Unless it's part of his long term defense strategy. If so, hats off to the long con.	20141128T130340
anonymous	1	0	I guess I was drawing a comparison of good Muslim and born again Christianity. I wasn't sure if ridding yourself of sin was part of the Muslim deal as well.

Therefore, if he did it then, what's the point of faith if your fucked in the end.	20141128T143615
soamx	2	0	Then what you are essentially saying is that because he claims to be a good Muslim he must be innocent. and if he's not innocent- then he's been lying for 15 years. To which I say, uhhh yeah. he's definitely either guilty or innocent.	20141128T131641
anonymous	1	0	> I would think a part of being a Muslim in good faith would be cleansing yourself of sin Actually no. That's a Christian conception mainly.

We also know Adnan lent Jay his car that day as well as on other days, from multiple people who have said it was normal for Jay to pick up Adnan from track in Adnans car.

And I can see how ""gas station"" is a kind of appealing phrase because the credit card issue is out there without much explanation. But all this person says is ""a gas station,"" nothing about the specific one or even the area where Hae's card was charged. And the more I read from Rabia, the less I think of her involvement in this case. For one, she doesn't make clear where this text is coming from. How then can she assert it's evidence of anything? She has repeatedly failed to redact Jay's last name from documents that she releases. And she keeps not-so-covertly suggesting that Jay murdered Hae. I mean, we all toy with these theories on the subreddit here, but for her, an apparently prominent lawyer, to be doing it on a public blog seems unethical or at least unwise. Maybe she hasn't quite crossed the line yet, but it looks to me like she's standing on it."	20141128T225824
anonymous	1	0	I wonder if there is a gas station near VIP and Blue Jays? I think it would be good to know the timeline of, when and where, these various trunk pops happened. My theory: when he tells the trunk pop story to Chris and to Yayib, he tells them it happened off of Edmonson Ave. . Jen told Jay on the 13th that Adnan was going to get caught because there are cameras on the roof of best buy. He trusts his friends but not totally, if someone does go to the cops they could find video of him and Adnan together. (What if Jay was playing look out, or helped move the body, or gave him a high 5 and a hug?) he is trying to avoid best buy getting out till he has no choice. Jay holds onto the Edmonson Ave location for the trunk till he realizes that he is already in way to deep, at that point he switches to Best Buy, because that's where it actually happened and Jen had already testified to it.	20141128T151244

Becoming an EMT-paramedic takes at least a year of pretty intense school and full time training. (there is also an intermediate level EMT in some states, but that level doesn't change the argument) A basic EMT can't do very much practice wise and they aren't trained in anything that you could argue would give them advanced knowledge in anatomy and physiology .

8shadesofgray	2	0	I've always assumed that night would have been a safer bet. This was a park in a very urban setting, bounded by highways ... The adjacent I-70 Park and Ride sits at the terminus of I-70 (aptly named, I know). It's not like the location is all that remote, and SK notes in Ep. 3 that they're not that far back from the road - still can see the traffic passing. Daytime just strikes me as a riskier bet that someone's going to catch sight of you or either car.	20141128T165818
mordello	2	0	The park is a commuter shortcut. Fair bit of traffic all the time. People driving west on 40 use the park as cut-through to Security Blvd or the neighborhood just above the park, Hunting Ridge. If you look at the crime scene photos, you can see the pull-off at the jersey wall barriers is not very big - it's right beside the road. The paved pull-off is still there but now the paved trail passes through it. So, even at night, a car would be very visible to passing traffic. This is particularly so in January, with no foliage cover. I think it would be very much possible to park there, get the body out and carry it 127 feet into the woods without being seen by passing traffic but the car being there would be very much noticeable. One might assume it was broken down or that someone was sitting in the car partying or something. Remember, the trails that is there now was not there then so there'd be little risk of walker passing by. If one really didn't want to be seen in the park by passing car traffic, it would have to be pretty late at night, when traffic is minimal and very occasionally passing by.	20141128T174347

I think his inconsistencies pretty clearly center around the things he knows he needs to lie about. Other things about that day are in crystal clear focus for him. I'm sure covering up a murder you committed is a very stressful thing to do, so I'm not surprised he's showing some signs of being traumatized.	20141128T161854
j2kelley	3	0	"A) To believe this notion - that Jay's post-facto involvement in Hae's murder was ""incredibly traumatizing for him, as (it) would be for any average person"" and it triggered a ""psychological tic"" that accounts for all the lies and inconsistencies in his police interview - is to also believe that Adnan could lose his shit to the degree that he murders a girl he supposedly loves and buries her body in the woods on a school night, yet remain seemingly *untraumatized* (according to your phsyco-logic). B) Here's another reason someone might ""narrativize an incident"": They're in deep trouble, and homicide detectives are offering a get-out-of-jail-free card if a story can be crafted to match their theory of the crime."	20141128T195232
anonymous	2	0	I really don't buy this theory, mainly because Jay was known as a liar by his friends before he ever testified to police. Rather than sounding traumatized, I think he sounded like someone who came up with a lie to clearly downplay his role in association to the murder, and the lies stemmed from a result of not being to keep his story straight AND having to change them after talking to the police to match the cell phone evidence. I don't know why everyone is claiming that Jay has to be a mastermind for Adnon to be innocent. The police already suspected Adnon for the murder, so it wouldn't have been hard for Jay to roll with the punches and tell them what they wanted to hear, especially when they let him change his stories multiple times without even corroborating his alibi.	20141128T164551

DaMENACE72	3	0	If Adnan is innocent, his name should be up there in your list. That's great that you are so convinced ( though you have yet to mention why) of Adnans guilt, and you make interesting points but there is plenty of readable doubt. None of the physical evidence independently confirms Jay's stories, so there is reason to doubt any one of the many versions. So if Adnan is innocent, your argument for not badmouthing the people in this case applies to him as well. Or it is OK because he is in jail and convicted?	20141128T225100
goliath_franco	3	0	"I don't think any bombshells are coming. Or at least, I don't think Serial or Rabia are sitting on any real bombshells. I think if they were, we would have heard about them by now. When Sarah is laying out the case for Adnan's innocence, it seemed to me like she was making the strongest case possible to increase the tension in the narrative as much as possible: The idea is to get the listener to think, ""Oh my gosh, there's an innocent guy sitting in jail. What the heck happened in this case?"" Whatever strong evidence there is of Adnan's innocence would have been presented in those episodes. I predict that, in the remaining episodes, we'll get more context and bits and pieces of information that don't really sway things one way or the other. For example, with Gutierrez, we'll hear some analysis about her trial strategy and how ethical she was in general, but we won't hear about clear misconduct on her part during the trial. We might hear more people's impressions of other people in the story -- again, nothing definitive. And so on. They're making the show as they go at this point, so I don't expect that they're holding something definitive back."	20141128T231332
I_W_N_R	4	0	I don't see any ethical problems with discussion of the case materials that are part of the public record. I understand that it may seem insensitive to the people involved, particularly Hae's family, but concern for their feelings is not a good enough reason to refrain from reexamination of what happened here. This case raises some pretty serious questions about our criminal justice system, that those questions impact all of us, not just the people directly involved. Now if someone is digging up non-public information about the folks involved in this case and posting it, that crosses a line. But case documents are public record for a reason - the criminal justice system needs to be accountable, and there can be no accountability without transparency. I certainly sympathize with the folks who were more directly involved or impacted by this case - particularly the family of Hae Min Lee. I wouldn't like it if an event in my life like this were turned into a podcast with millions of listeners. But that doesn't mean it's wrong or unethical.	20141128T154826
anonymous	8	0	Just because some charming sociopath with the right friends wants a new trial, I question the ethics of bring more pain to all who were dragged into his evil dog and pony show. As lawyers say never ask a question in court that you don't already know the answer to. I think it a little self serving for the makers of Serial to have opened this thing up without knowing the ending. Without knowing if the ending is worth putting the players through this again. Screw the listeners, it's a good presentation no matter how it ends, but real people are now living under a real microscope or maybe we should say kaleidoscope. You probably already said it better, but here I said it again slightly differently.	20141128T155111

See Kelly Oxford on Twitter (500,000 followers) making these accusations. http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/03/05/55427.htm The theories about Ritz are supported by similar actions he took as a detective investigating other homicides. In the above referenced case, he is accused of planting drugs and threatening drug charges against two woman unless they agreed to pose as witnesses and provide false testimony implicating an innocent man in murder. I personally don't subscribe to the Jay as killer theory. I do subscribe to the Jay as perjured witness under police threat theory, which is at least plausible considering the cop's questionable integrity and absurdly high success rate in clearing cases.	20141129T065115

reddit1070	3	0	Adnan's a cold blooded murderer. Jay is definitely trying to minimize his own involvement. So we don't know the detailed timeline. However, there is no doubt in my mind that Adnan planned it, and carried it out. He bought the cell phone a day or two before, gave Jay the phone and the car, was heard by a friend asking Hae for a ride, the stuff at Cathy's, the cell tower data in the evening, not calling Hae after she went missing, and perhaps most damning, not fighting back against Jay after all the accusations that Jay has lobbed at him. And Jay said Adnan looked for cash in Hae's wallet before tossing it -- there was none. How cold blooded. He has been accused of stealing money from mosque worshippers. You guys are defending a guy who would kill again if he is let out. People like Nisha are lucky he has been put away.	20141128T194713

ScaryPenguins	11	0	I think the issue is that many people believe, after also considering the evidence, that is extremely likely Adnan is innocent. Therefore, some of the considerations you list above are justified (though people certainly can afford to use more discretion and respect.) I think there is enough conflicting evidence that it is impossible to make any conclusions about the case at this point-we're really just trusting that SK and crew are taking us somewhere good and fair. I'm ok with that.	20141128T160329
rayfound	1	0	It seems pretty clear to me that if they got it right, it was by pure dumb luck.... There is way more than a reasonable doubt as to adnans guilt. If all that comes of this is a more thorough investigation and analysis, it is worth it. I mean, for Christ's sake: its been completely demonstrated that the timeline narrative used to convict is bogus.	20141128T161526
anonymous	2	0	Let's just agree to disagree. *If* Adnan had killed Hae, yes, I would agree, he's as cold as they get. But I don't believe that he did. And the only reason *you do* is because of the testimony of a documented liar. Who, by the way, has since been charged with assault on a police officer and two counts of domestic violence. So tell me again who has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency of violence—particularly against *women*—along with a general predisposition for deceit? Because it sure as hell isn't Adnan.	20141128T220536

DaMENACE72	3	0	How does that independently corrobate Adnans guilt? At best it shows that Adnan was at Cathy's but never that he was at Best Buy or Leakin Park. The cell tower evidence only tells where the phone may have been at the time of the calls, not who was with the phone at the time. The reason we can confirm Adnan was at Cathy's at the time of a few calls was because Cathy INDEPENDENTLY verified that piece of information. Not piece of evidence Jay provided that proves Adnan's guilt was independently verified by any other source. Show me one... You can't and that is why there is a podcast and why we debate it endlessly. Believing Jay's story is fine, but the absolutely crucial pieces of his story that prove Adnan's guilt cannot be independently verified by another source. Hence the reason the Innocence Project took on the case, and hence the reason there is so much doubt in regards to Adnan's guilt or innocence. All we have to go on are witness testimony that Adnan says is not true. Anyone that says they know for sure either was involved or full of shit.	20141129T013432
rayfound	4	0	My suspicion is that SK is fairly confident in adnans innocence, but vastly less sure of the guilty party, and that is the remaining mystery. Also, don't neglect the possibility of jay not having any genuine testimony. Tal#507 is eye opening.	20141128T162104
anonymous	4	0	Seems so. But I'm reading SK as a liberal who would only be interested in this story if Adnan were innocent.

ScaryPenguins	5	0	I think the show becomes harder to justify from a potential consequence standpoint if it concludes that Adnan is guilty. I don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with re-investigating crimes, even if it might be uncomfortable for some involved (or even if the investigation concludes guilt); however, since Serial became so popular there is always the chance of random people doing stupid things that affect real people. I'm less concerned about online discussion scrutiny than I am of real life harms. I doubt SK+team will do a crime re-investigation like this again. I'd guess they never planned on it becoming this popular and they are at least mildly concerned about harms it might cause.	20141128T163621
ravonin	1	0	Is this true? I would appreciate a source and details. Thanks beforehand.	20141129T141938
readybrek	1	0	Yes, because the Innocence project really only want to take on a case where there is a good chance they can exonerate the accused. They have many cases where there is DNA evidence which is one of the easier ways of exonerating someone. There is none in this case so it was turned down. Same when Rabia reached out. I doubt they bothered even reading the case file because they are busy with the more definite cases. If you have limited time and resources you have to target them as well as you possibly can. For whatever reason, they read Adnan's file this time and decided to take this case on. That's a big thing and hard to dismiss when considering Adnan's innocence or guilt in the eyes of the law.	20141130T093542
anonymous	1	0	Let's say we don't have Jay's story, just entertain me for a second. We don't have that. What does the circumstantial evidence say? The fact that he bought a cell phone becomes innocuous, as does the 3:32 Nisha call, and his loaning of his cellphone and car. None of those things are suspicious if you don't believe Jay's story. The only one that's questionable is his asking Hae for a ride. However, Becky and Summer both said they saw her at 3 o'clock at WHS, so what, Adnan's just hanging around at the high school for 45 minutes, waiting for Hae to leave so he can get a ride with her, after she's already said she can't give him one? That doesn't make any sense.	20141129T162431

keystone66	1	0	>That doesn't show what you say it's showing. Sure does. >The article does not state why post-conviction relief was granted. It doesn't? Because it's pretty straightforward in explaining that an innocent man was able to prepare an appeal based solely on an allegation that police committed misconduct leading to his wrongful conviction... But hey, maybe you're just wrong. >Nor does it include any statement from the judge on Ritz's conduct. The judge granting an appeal that releases a convicted murderer based on allegations (ostensibly supported by evidence) of the investigating detective's misconduct is a pretty clear statement about that officer's conduct... >Also, please note the plaintiff is suing Mayor and City Council; Baltimore City Police Department; Ed Norris, former police commissioner; Anthony Batts, current police commissioner, and many more. Which is a very common tactic to demonstrate claims of failure to train, failure to supervise, conspiracy, etc. All of which are based on the underlying allegations of the fundamental misconduct on the part of the detectives. >This is lawyer posturing before the suit, which, as I said, is not even in the discovery phase yet. Again, the civil suit is irrelevant, as relief was already granted based on the initial appellate action which was based on the same claims being made in the civil suit. The appellate relief required a significantly higher standard of evidence than will be required in the civil suit, but hey, let's just ignore context.	20141129T172333
jesskamb	2	0	> I'd guess they never planned on it becoming this popular and they are at least mildly concerned about harms it might cause. I agree with most of what you said, except this.

Obviously I don't know SK personally, but I think she in a kind hearted person who would not be comfortable opening this pandoras box unless there was a good reason to. I also think the Serial team has gone to great lengths to make this podcast suspenseful by introducing the evidence in a calculated way. I took SK at her word when she said in episode 6 that she was telling us everything that she knew that could be held against Adnan. There are some significant things I know from reddit and the interwebs that she hasn't shared on the podcast, all of which point to Adnan's innocence, so I have to assume that that's where we're headed.	20141128T181647

anonymous	4	0	Do you think that's because they don't exist, or that they are not being released?	20141128T154852
anonymous	7	0	So she's only posting edited things that point towards his innocence? It sure would be nice if someone who worked on the prosecution would do a blog posting only things from the investigation that make him look guilty then. This doesn't seem very balanced. I thought the point was to get to the truth. Don't lawyers have to swear to some sort of ethical standard when they become a member of the Bar?	20141128T172237
8shadesofgray	1	0	That being said, there is a one-page summary of Adnan's first police interview at his house, toward the end of the Jenn document. It's unclear whether it was recorded or additional notes taken or if this one page was it from that interview.	20141128T171009
8shadesofgray	2	0	Someone had also posted on here that they had requested some documents and were told that they were not available to the general public opposite an active appeal. Don't know if this was true/accurate, just that it was shared :)	20141128T181303
juliebeeswax	1	0	I really have no idea. If Rabia had them, I can't see any reason why SK hasn't used ANYTHING from them. I'm of the opinion that they probably don't exist at all because he probably lawyered up and didn't tell the cops anything, besides the first interview at his house where just a few written notes were taken.	20141128T205428
ScaryPenguins	4	0	I dont think you can say releasing Jay and Jenn's police interviews is something only pointing towards innocence? Also, Adnan might not have been interviewed by the police if he asked for a lawyer.	20141128T174506
8shadesofgray	6	0	"I don't think there's anything to suggest that she's giving us edited documents - they seem to be full documents. She may not be giving us everything she has - at least not all at once, but that doesn't mean the documents themselves are edited. I agree that it would be great to have a counter-voice on the prosecutorial side. But I have a hard time understanding how that's Rabia's responsibility. And I don't understand what ethical breach she could be making here - she's not acting as an attorney on this case ... She's posting primarily public documents that she requested. She includes multiple disclaimers in her blogs about her position and her role as an advocate, not as an independent investigator. She has a particular vantage point, but the documents she's posting don't seem to be doctored or abridged. I just don't understand what she's doing ""wrong""."	20141128T175159
mostpeoplearedjs	3	0	"You honestly think it's some kind of bar violation to release some of the 1000s of pages she has but not every single page? And no, there's no general requirement that lawyers be ""balanced"" in every statement they make. The general requirement is that opposite - they zealously advocate for their clients. It's an adversarial system, and lawyers push their client's position in a decidedly partisan and ""unbalanced"" way. All of which assumes she's acting as a lawyer in this case. If she's just a private citizen, she can say anything she wants as long as she doesn't lie. Rules of ethics preclude lawyers from lying. But holding back some or all of the 1000s of documents she's carted around, and paid for, and would presumably have to pay to scan and upload- no, not an ethical violation."	20141128T182036

anonymous	3	0	That's one way to look at edited. I can release all or some of the documents, the choice of what to release is editing as well. However it appears that she does some quoting of a select paragraph from documents and doesn't release the full context. (Adnan's quote about Hae confronting Jay, the note on the bottom of her latest blog. ) This really wasn't meant to be about Rabia. It's more a request for a balanced presentation of information. If anyone can gain access to Adnan's statements to the police, I would love to see them.	20141128T180926
anonymous	2	0	No, I don't know. that is why I asked. I don't really have any beef with Rabia, something about the way these were released on thanksgiving morning feels weird to me. It's her prerogative I just need to be aware that this is an biased source.	20141128T182837
8shadesofgray	1	0	I agree with that last statement. And sorry if I seem to be barking out a defense for Rabia. I really admire her and the energy, passion and resolve she's brought to the case ... And SUPER grateful that she was willing to share such full documentation with us. So I guess I'm quick to come defense :D	20141128T181623
CoronetVSQ	276	0	I was so intrigued by your post that I went to the Best Buy. Yes, there are two plates for outlets on the left wall as one walks into the lobby. They are consistent with electrical boxes or phone lines although they are higher than one would typically place an electrical outlet or switch.There was previously a post or piece of wood attached on the wall between the two covered outlets that was positioned vertically about 8 inches wide and about 6 feet high. I can see where this wall has been painted and there is a paint outline (build-up) of where this object was attached. Also, there is a piece of carpet patched on the floor (about 8 inches deep by 18 inches wide) immediately below where the object was attached to the wall. It would be consistent with a plate or stand that was previously attached to the floor. The carpet patch is not subtle. My best guess is that this is consistent with a pair of pay phones. It could possibly be something else but it is definitely worth checking into. Of course, if it was a pay phone, there is nothing to say that it was there in 1999. There is nothing on the corner of the face of the building indicating previous pay phones. That corner is where the map drawn by Jay indicates they were. Again, that was 15 years ago. I am sending this from my iPad from the from the parking lot of Best Buy. I am getting out of here as it is mobbed due to Black Friday. I have a few photos that I will try to post later. Link to photo of patch on floor in the vestibule/lobby of Best Buy. Pay no attention to the bright looking stripe above it on the wall. This is from where the door was slightly open and the sun was shining in. http://imgur.com/VSTOQF8 Also, some asked for a shot of the front door of the Best Buy. Here it is. http://imgur.com/xFZT5wC And, here is a photo of the corner of the left front of the store where Jay said Adnan was standing by the pay phones. The corner of the store is about 90 to 100 feet from the front door. http://i.imgur.com/BwbT7Do.jpg *Edited to add photos.	20141128T183150

SK is old enough to remember that pay phones in stores and malls were very often located between the two sets of doors or by the bathrooms. Seems like the kind of thing SK should have discovered herself, considering she was actually looking for it. I am beginning to feel that the only way to improve our understanding of that day is with DNA evidence. Everything else we are just chasing our tails.	20141128T192706
Charles148	12	0	"Here is my take: The payphone is irrelevent! Jay says Adnan called him and said to meet at Best Buy, do you think jay asked ""Hey Adnan just to be clear you are calling from payphones in the lobby of best buy?"" Disproving small details, or even large ones, of Jays story (or stories) doesn't change much. Unless you can disprove him being with adnan, or explain how he knew the location of Hae's car everything else he said could have been a lie and it doesn't mean much for adnan's status as guilty or innocent."	20141128T212119

Episode 9 **Sarah Koenig** The pay phone in question is important because Jay tells the detectives that Adnan called him on January 13, 1999 and told Jay he’d killed Hae. “Come and get me, I’m at Best Buy.” *When Jay gets there he says he sees Adnan standing by the phone booth wearing red gloves.* He draws a map for the cops showing the location of the phone booth and if you’re facing the front doors of the store his drawing shows the booth on the left outside on the sidewalk."	20141128T180541

yamahamg	3	0	"They spend a year researching this ahead of time, from what I heard, which means the choices they are making are important, that this Best Buy payphone angle is significant. I don't know if it was this last episode or a previous one when Jenn says ""I never thought it happened at Best Buy"", Chris says it happened at the library, and Laura says there were no phones there. It is *very* strange that no one on either side was interested in verifying this fact or checking the records, if they existed. Anyway, I think establishing that it didn't happen at Best Buy is going to end up being more important than it seems, that is, it will end up being more than merely poking holes in Jays' story. In conclusion, if one can come to any conclusions, it seems safe to conclude it didn't happen at Best Buy."	20141130T014925
Riffler	4	0	People have said there were always blanks - presumably as shown in your photo, so the photo in itself is not proof one way or the other. Isn't it a little odd to have a fire/alarm zone panel above a payphone - how recent is that? And is that a heating vent above the other?	20141128T163536
anonymous	9	0	I don't buy it. I think the fact that there are a lack of pay phone records (the police never bothered to extract those) is s huge indication this was made up. They only have proof that a call was received at 2:36 on Adnan's cellphone BUT if Adnan made thst call from BB then they should have the records to proof that. Important for two reasons; 1.) proof that the murder happened at BB and 2.) that the murder happened at 2:36. It has always bothered me that the police never bothered to get those records! We only have Jay's testimony to believe if we believe there were pay phones at BB. One more thing, even if there were pay phones at BB, that doesn't change the fact that there is no way Hae was dead by 2:36 making that call almost irrelevant all together.	20141128T162751

Amicus_Sucima	2	0	I have been involved in Malls for some time: 1. Best buy would typically put phones in a lockable lobby/vestibule. This aligns with the posters relatives description. (malls put them on the out side for multiple stores to use....best buy (single big box stores) would not want to have people out front using the phone after hours...hanging out and dealing drugs...planning murder) 2. The spacing look correct for a 1999 phone set up: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/TV6akAl.gif) 3. It would be easy to see what was there by taking off the plates. Ironiclly, finding no wires would be as telling as finding conduit. Phone wires often ran free of conduit. 4. I bet There is a set of as-built drawings at Bust Buy headquarters or some where in the building.	20141202T004607

soamx	2	0	This is amazing. Because reddit investigators and regular people finding information like this coming out could potentially be a smoking gun that would clear this case up. However, this specific instance doesn't move the needle much for me. Jay said the payphone was outside, and drew a picture of it being outside. There continues to be no proof of that and it continues to be another strike against Jays story (that contains many inaccuracies and impossibilities) Adnan said when talking to SK he didn't think he could get to Best Buy and make a call from the lobby. (Although no one ever claimed he was in the lobby) Some people might take this as a slip up. However to me, it's very possible I'm sure Adnan has been inside that best buy before and remembers where the pay phones were. So he would assume that was the pay phone in question. This is actually another instance of Adnan telling the truth even in a situation where it only makes his case weaker. He frequently does these things, which strike me as very odd because if he was a guilty person who was lying about all of this- why does he not tell any lies that benefit him? He has a strong alibi for the 7:16 Leakin Park call (he was at mosque with multiple witnesses) Yet he says he doesn't remember giving Jay his phone during this time. Seems like a perfect opportunity for him to lie and give himself an easy out in the case if he was guilty, but he doesn't tell it.	20141128T194742
anonymous	3	0	Assuming this is true - and I agree it is potentially monumental - what do you guys this it would really change? Adnan says he phoned in the lobby. Jay said outside and made a drawing - it would just merely prove Jay was lying yet again no? Does it add anything?	20141128T155640

birdsofterrordise	2	0	Most stores really didn't have payphones inside the store, they were generally outside of the store, in public areas OR if they were inside of a store, they would be near the restrooms and Best Buy does usually (or did) have public restrooms. I actually asked an interior design family friend about this. Phones in the lobby may actually be problematic design wise because of safety codes. The lobby and door area need to be clear for foot traffic and I would propose that it would not pass codes to just have two payphones in the area of traffic, even by late 90s standards, unless by some miracle the building had been there for awhile and overlooked that rule. You have to consider they are fairly bulky and then also add space for a person to stand. I imagine that people would complain about being able to walk in and out, regardless of concerns about safety.	20141128T182852
elizabethraine	2	0	If there were pay phones, they may have been taken out prior to 1999. I was living in small town Ohio in the late 90s, and by then pay phones were already being phased out of public spaces, I imagine in Baltimore and similarly sized areas it was happening faster.	20141128T205656

Akbrown19	1	0	What I can't fathom is why the cops didn't check out this phone, at all. If there WAS a phone there, why wouldn't they have subpoenaed the phone records and found that incriminating 2:36 call? The answer is simple: either there was no phone there, or there was no 2:36 call. Which begs the question… why did they push forward with this (obviously incorrect) timeline?	20141203T174932
Nerdboxer	1	0	This is pure conjecture, but I was a teenager in the late 90's who didn't drive yet and I would be dropped off frequently at Best Buy to look at CD's or whatever. While not at the same Best Buy in Serial, it was a mid to late 90's Best Buy. I have a pretty good recollection of there being payphones in that little lobby/alcove when you walk in the first set of doors. I say this because I'm pretty sure I used them to call my parents to pick me up a few times. Like I said, no proof or definitive answer, but when I heard about a payphone at Best Buy in the podcast, I immediately pictured ones like the ones I remembered in that lobby/alcove.	20141204T142957
joeydee523	1	0	Has anyone come forward official to state there was a phone there? If there were phones, employees would've known about them. Just like they would know where the restrooms are, they would know where the nearest payphone was. In addition employees would've used those phones if they existed. Lastly, someone had to come and collect the coins from the phone and service it. So if the phones existed, there has to be someone out there who can say with 100 percent certainty that there were phones.	20141214T222653

HOWEVER...interior walls in big box stores are almost exclusively made of flimsy Sheetrock that would be far too weak to mount a payphone on. The carpet patch would indicate that the two phones, although wired through the wall, were mounted to pedastals on the floor and then perhaps secured to the wall at the top of the booths using a 2x4.	20141128T201811

In episode 9 she thought it was important enough to begin with Laura's testament that there were never any phones in the Best Buy lobby, and SK believes it because Laura admits to shoplifting there, i.e. she was observant about such details. This calls into question the reliability of any of the supposed ""critical facts"" that come from witnesses to lend credence to one story or another, and I think it's telling of SK's partiality."	20141129T080927

cbr1965	11	0	It was so bizarre that none of the phone companies could find a record of one at the at location and Best Buy's own records show there wasn't a phone there based on bills they paid during that time frame. The Payphone Project guy couldn't find one either - other than the one that existed at the Ramada Inn before the Best Buy was built. I am still a little skeptical that they were there at all if for no other reason than Best Buy and the phone companies, who have records from that time, do not have those phones listed anywhere. Add to that, Jay's hand drawn picture had the phone outside at a booth and it really doesn't matter or change the doubt that exists about this one version of his story. (Not to say there weren't pay phones there at some time, just not in that particular time period - at least going by phone company and Best Buy records.)	20141128T203232
ShrimpChimp	2	0	SK goes through this in some detail -it's one of the few times her story is thorough. She runs down all possible sources of info. Nothing appears to support the phone. She then outlines how and why we may not have records. Where does Adnan say anything about using a pay phone at Best Buy except in response to the case that was built around the call log and Jay's statements?	20141128T180455
Atomic190	6	0	I'm not saying I'm not curious about this point but for this to be significant it has to assume he didn't get the detail or the suggestion that there was a payphone in the lobby from any other source.	20141128T192245
juliebeeswax	13	0	Don't see how it is. The fact that Adnan knew there was a payphone in the lobby just shows that he had been inside there before. It just paints to Jay being a liar (again) since his map showed it outside.	20141128T205633
hanatheko	5	0	If that story is true, I do believe that the 'phone booth by the entrance' is really this vestibule or entrance area because you can probably see someone using a phone from the front of the building.

After the first set of doors and before the second. I'm assuming that is where the pay phones were. I could conceivably see calling that area ""outside the store"". It's an odd description but it sorta makes sense. Sorta. And if Adnan was standing just outside the doors, I guess you could call him ""by the pay phones"" and ""in the parking lot."" He's outside both sets of automatic doors. The pay phone is right there in sight just inside the first set of doors, and he is outside the entire store in the parking lot. I don't think I would ever use those words to describe the arrangement, but that's the only way I can see this making any sense whatsoever."	20141128T163154

corabaint	1	0	If this part of Jay's testimony is true, I think it's very telling that Adnan earlier mentions he would have used a pay phone in the Best Buy lobby (when he explains to SK that he could not made it to Best Buy in 21 minutes.) So if he did call Jay from Best Buy, he would have known the pay phone was inside the store. When Jay pulls up and sees Adnan standing there, he likely just assumes that he is standing beside a pay phone booth he just used, but it could have been another structure Jay didn't scrutinize when he pulled up.	20141129T193606

EsperStormblade	8	0	It's clear the timeline is wrong. But it is possible to account for Best Buy and so on and know that the timeline is wrong. So, to speculate for a moment, if Adnan killed Hae at the Woodlawn library, on campus, where we know they both were at 3pm, he could have driven her car to Best Buy to get far away from where anyone may have potentially seen him AND to move her body to the trunk unseen, and called Jay from there. Not at 2:36 but at 3:15. Jay's timeline is messed up from the beginning, so it doesn't matter that the 3:15 call doesn't reconcile with his original timeline.	20141128T163249

Seems like a perfect opportunity for him to lie and give himself an easy out in the case if he was guilty, but he doesn't tell it.

On the other hand, seems extremely odd that the defense couldn't produce even one witness (other than his dad) who says Adnan was at the mosque. Giving Adnan the benefit of doubt, maybe his dad got the time wrong or maybe Adnan knew he could slip out early and told Jay to pick him up at 9. It's plausible he'd loan Jay his cell/car again and this gives Jay 1.5-hours where he has no alibi, since he says he was with Adnan... But, someone else should have seen Adnan at the mosque, right? And, why would he forget loaning his cell to Jay again? Esp since that was a pattern (loaning his car/cell to Jay) that whole day... Makes no sense.

SK postulates that it could have been inside the foyer, to which Laura still says there was no phone because she used to shoplift there and never saw one since the store had opened. SK says they tried to look into it to figure out if there was ever a phone set up at that location but couldn't figure it out.

molly11180	1	0	There is one possibility that could explain why the phone companies didn't have a record - the phone was owned by Best Buy. In those days, a lot of retail establishments would own the phones - you bought the phone from a seller, hooked it up to a phone line, and serviced it yourself (or hired a third party to do so). Similar to buying a vending machine and stocking it yourself, it was a (minor) revenue generator for stores, especially so they didn't have to tie up store phone lines or provide a regular phone to customers or employees. You could often find them in small businesses, motels, even doctors offices - sometimes they were almost residential-style phones with a slot for change, sometimes they were old actual pay phones they bought from resellers. Since the phone companies didn't service the equipment (only the line), they would not have a record of it. If we really want to establish if there was a payphone inside the store, I would recommend trying to get Best Buy's utility payment records for 1999. They would establish how many phone lines they had and what the numbers were. You can use the numbers to identify where the lines were installed. It won't necessarily identify it as a payphone, but it's pretty much the only reason a non-emergency-only phone would be installed in a retail lobby.	20141209T233743

EnsignCrunch	1	0	It's a bit of a stretch but it's not impossible that Jay would refer to the glass-enclosed vestibule as a phone booth. I'm the same age as these guys and while I remember pay phones being everywhere, honest-to-god phone booths were extremely rare (left vs right in [this image](http://webnerhouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/dsc02177.jpg)). There are two x's on his drawing which is a little ambiguous. I'm inclined to agree that it's probably moot in the face of all the other 'inconsistencies.'	20141129T015404

EvilSockMonkey	13	0	/u/-Stephaine- makes an excellent point. We all agree that the police did not pursue anything that might disprove their case, but checking the records of outgoing calls from those pay phones (if they existed) is a complete no brainer. Even if the police didn't, the prosecutor certainly would have. With a phone record, both ends of the call are proven. Without, it is only an allegation. If they did check for phone records and discovered that none existed, then the only down side is that they have is another inconsistency in Jay's story. By the time they got to trial, they would have had to have at least three people on staff just to keep track of those. Even if the police and prosecution did not check the phone records, then the defense sure as hell should have! If no calls were placed from those phones at 2:36, then that surely would have caused serious problems for the prosecutions's theory. if the phones existed and neither the prosecution or the defense used records from them, it seems to me that more questions are raised than are answered. - All due respect to Saxsolos excellent OP	20141128T171427

He is guilty and so he knows nothing happened at best buy and thus is always ready to talk about ""best buy details"" because they should help his case to get out since that is not where the murder happened. Or, that is just the best buy in his neighborhood that he has been to a hundred times and has used the phone maybe once or twice so he just knows about it and that knowledge has 0 relation to this murder case. Or being a kid from the 90's when you needed to call someone you had to figure things out, walking into stores, any store, and asking the first employee you see if they have a phone to use was not uncommon before cells became popular and those habits lingered. Either way this is interesting information but it has no effect on either side's story. Jay was pretty clear about the phone being out on the street, which this phone still isn't."	20141128T215656

anonymous	20	0	No, it's not missing, that is the exact context. And because of that context I find it weird that Adnan 'makes up' the lobby location of the phones in his hypothetical, instead of using the outside location which was what was used in trial. Either this is more Adnan-luck, or he is properly remembering what he actually did.	20141128T171027
bencoccio	16	0	How is this a classic cop show guilty-guy slip up? Adnan has never said there were no phones at the Best Buy. He may have used those phones for non-murdering purposes. Or he just saw the phones there/knew they were there. What's the big deal? Anyways, it certainly doesn't make the timeline any more plausible. And still, the only person saying anything happened at Best Buy is Jay - one of like 4 places he says it happens at different times.	20141128T205411

iff_p	23	0	Yeah, I have no problem with Adnan knowing on a subconscious level from past experience that there were phones in the lobby - I also have no problem with Jay incorrectly drawing a phone on the outside of the store. If Jay had come to get him at Best Buy, Adnan could have been standing waiting outside the store, and Jay might just have gotten it into his head that he'd made the call from out there too.

EvilSockMonkey	3	0	Neither version is clearly superior to the other. Key to me is that Adnan has had 15 years to think about that part of the testimony. If he didn't have a memory of the phones being there, it seems he would have said so rather than granting their existence in his hypothetical. That does not mean that they were there 1/13/1999.	20141128T235132
batutah	1	0	Well.... I ran a Borders for most of the aughts and I am quite certain there was a payphone by the restrooms. On the other hand, I never dealt with any of the paperwork to do with the payphone, never paid or received payment for it or anything. I assume this was done with the corporate office. So -- if SK contacted the management at the local store, they might not have any record of it. But if she talked to someone who worked at the Best Buy in 99 (as above), I am sure they would remember it; there is a fair amount of drama surrounding payphones... Not sure how important this all is, but it is kinda interesting...	20141129T033730

Perhaps what Adnan really knows if the state has the 2:36 time wrong on the call because he knows it was later than that. He's had years to ponder this and in thinking about how long it took him to do all he did, he figures there's no way it could have been done by 2:36 and decides to use this angle to discredit Jay's story. Perhaps there was a phone in the parking lot as well.

BranSerial	12	0	Just a quick legal perspective on your observations: If the government did check the payphone records, and found no calls corroborating the 2:36 call to Adnan's cell, then it seems to me that would've been material whose disclosure to the defense would have been required under Brady v. Maryland (long story short, a Supreme Court case holding that due process requires disclosure of all exculpatory material to the defense). And I think that would've been a material non-disclosure, given the emphasis the government placed on the timeline at trial. This is all to say that any such failure, if proven, could form the basis for a successful petition for post-conviction relief. If the government never looked into the phone records at all, however, then you've just got an ineffective assistance of counsel argument owing to the defense attorney's failure to run them down herself. For a few different reasons, that's a much tougher case to make from Adnan's perspective.	20141128T190515
RadioMonster	0	0	> if the phones existed and neither the prosecution or the defense used records from them, it seems to me that more questions are raised than are answered.

Law enforcement delivered them one, inconsistencies be damned. As for the defense - have you listened to some of those recordings? She does not even sound sane.

GAMEOVER	2	0	Yeah, I totally agree and I think the takeaway from this whole exercise is that witnesses and their memories are not reliable no matter how adamant they are. We shape and reshape our memory of events every time we revisit them. They are colored by our biases. To quote from the episode: > Interestingly, Jim Trainum, the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation, immediately disregarded every single statement about Adnan’s reaction. In terms of evaluating someone’s guilt, he said, stuff like that is worthless. He advised me to do the same, just toss it all out he said, because it’s subjective, it’s hindsight, and also, people tend to bend their memories to what they think police think they want to hear. And yet so much of the reporting in this podcast is about people's subjective feelings about one person or another's guilt or innocence.	20141129T091452
anonymous	15	0	Also, haven't we confirmed at this point (ep. 9) that Hae wasn't killed until after 3? Because that kind of makes the best Buy call/detail less relevant. Especially if the murder wasn't at Best Buy.	20141128T225804

mdmrules	24	0	Uhhh... slow down there. The way the quote was delivered... look at it. It was lead with a misleading intro that lacked all context.That's all toastfuker was saying. It doesn't prove that Jay was lying or that Adnan was lying... it's a detail that people remember differently. Remember, (according to his story) Jay didn't make the phone call from the pay phones. If his story is true or not, his concept of where the phones are is from memory alone, not any claimed first hand experience that day. Adnan either has an actual memory of using the phones that day, or another day. Why no one has ever caught this difference I don't know, but it doesn't prove anything concrete for either guy IMO.	20141128T172408

But, they way things have changed since 1990, and the integration of phone lines into other systems, the rectangular wall plates seem to be the norm.

BranSerial	6	0	I think it's a little bit trickier than that. Let's assume that the government pulled the payphone records prior to trial; those records showed that there was no outgoing 2:36pm call; yet the government did not disclose this evidence to the defense. If the government still goes ahead with the timeline that it actually used, including the 2:36pm Best Buy call, then this undisclosed evidence flatly contradicts the government's case, so you're clearly in prime Brady-land. But in your scenario, the government recognizes this problem ahead of trial and decides to use a different timeline that isn't inconsistent with the lack of a 2:36pm Best Buy call. In this case, the evidence of no Best Buy call doesn't directly contradict the case made by the government at trial. But it still does contradict the pre-trial account (or at least one of the accounts) of the government's star witness. A competent defense counsel might use this evidence to impeach the credibility of that witness by demonstrating the falsity of one of the witness's accounts of events. A Supreme Court case that followed up to Brady, Giglio v. United States, established that impeachment evidence is generally subject to Brady. But I think it would be harder to establish that the failure to disclose this impeachment evidence likely affected the outcome at trial (especially since there was already plenty of other evidence that several of Jay's accounts were false), so relief would be more difficult to obtain under your scenario. Hope that's helpful.	20141128T193222

mdmrules	6	0	No, Adnan is explaining that it would be impossible for him to commit the crime given the 21 minute window available. In the midst of explaining himself he slipped in that getting to the phones *in the lobby of Best Buy* is part of that hypothetical 21 minutes, not outside as Jay claimed... Before today we were being led to believe that there was no confirmation of pay phones being at best buy at all, this info from OP is the first confirmation I have heard that there in fact were pay phones and they were in the lobby. This is new information that, for whatever reason, Adnan seems to have prior knowledge of. But it does not necessarily mean that Jay is a liar, or that Adnan knows about the phones because he made the call that day just as Jay claims he did. All I am saying is that this is new and really interesting information, but it neither condemns nor exonerates anyone's story.	20141128T230306

Blahblahblahinternet	1	0	"I think that logic is just a stretch. Think about it, if you're Adnan, you know that Jay has accused you of making the most important phone call of your life from a pay phone at bestbuy. You don't know the location of the pay phone, you just know that's what Jay said. If you volunteer, without any prompt, that you ""walked into the lobby to use a pay phone"" as an answer to a relatively innocuous question regarding a time line, then it's pretty good insight into your headspace. It's almost like you're seeing a place in your brain."	20141129T034842
Blahblahblahinternet	1	0	Adding a detail not before present is a big problem. I don't know where the lobby story line came from, but if it came from Adnan, and there were phones there, then it's pretty damaging.	20141128T231411

anonymous	4	0	Yes, but Adnan has probably used those pay phones before for other reasons (paging a friend, calling his parents because his car broke down), he's using his own knowledge of those phones from previous use. I haven't lived in my old home town for over 8 years, but I can tell you where most of the pay phones are located because I was the same age as Adnan, and in order to get ahold of my friends I would have to go to a payphone and call them (although sometimes our local library would let you use their office phone, depending on which librarian was working).	20141129T040348
partymuffell	1	0	Also, note that this is something today-Adnan says, not 1999-Adnan, so he must remember those pay phones in the lobby really well for some reason!	20141129T035601
bencoccio	8	0	Only if it's a TV show and Adnan is a character and you have a bunch of scenes where he denies there were pay phones at the Best Buy and then slips up in a climactic court room scene where he, for argument's sake, says if there were pay phones, he could never get to the lobby in time to make a call. Duh duh duuuuuh. But in real life, he has never said there are no pay phones at the Best Buy and may have used those pay phones in the lobby or seen those pay phones in the lobby and it's absolutely no big deal that he describes those phones as such when he's talking about the state's time line. It's not like he and SK are coordinating all communication here and Adnan is the one who told her to tell you that there are no pay phones up in that Best Buy.	20141129T011557

GauchoBearBulldog	3	0	This seems very important. At 2:36 the incoming call is routed to the tower and dish pointing to Jen's house. The incoming 3:15 call is routed to the tower and dish pointed *away* from Jen's house and *towards* Best Buy, basically in the exact opposite corners of the I-695 and I-70 interchange, indicating that the phone moved there between those calls.	20141128T181042
EsperStormblade	2	0	He really only need an alibi from between 3:00 and 3:15. And, the call log supports the possibility that he was at Jenn's house at that time.	20141128T165158

BranSerial	3	0	"Yes. There is only one scenario in which that makes any sense to me, and that's the one in which the lawyer knows that those records would turn up an incriminating call, whether or not a 2:36pm call to Adnan's cell.

mdmrules	2	0	"> A slip implies that Adnan is caught having some piece of information that he claims not to have. Not necessarily. It just means that the narrative never included phones in a lobby... in Adnan's quick recounting of the narrative to make a point, they're in the lobby... whatever, minor detail right?.... but wait, now today we have (possible) confirmation there were phones in the lobby some years back. Noteworthy that he would say that isn't it? Considering the story has been that he used phones in the parking lot which no one could find in 2014? I stand by calling that a possible ""slip"". And honestly I don't think you are reading my posts thoroughly. My only claim is that it's new information. It doesn't make anyone a liar or anyone get off the hook for the crime. It's possibly a slip by Adnan, or meaningless. Interesting to see that phones were probably there though.... and not where Jay states."	20141129T003044
bencoccio	3	0	Again, so what? I still fail to see how this is significant. Are you really implying that he killed Hae, made the call from the Best Buy lobby, lied it about it for 15 years and them fucks up now in a way only careful podcast listeners can discern?	20141129T040405

So I don't think we can take that kind of comment as an admission of his guilt, I think it's an admission of he thinks about that day A LOT because it's that day that got him in jail.

glammer17	2	0	"exactly - he is just restating whatever it was Jay claimed - but with the correct information (maybe he doesn't realize that every third word out of Jay's mouth is more than likely incorrect). To me this is possibly more damning to Jay because it's just another example of faulty information, made up story, and Adnan potentially being unaware of all of it and assuming that if Jay says Best Buy pay phones - surely he means the ones that actually existed - in the lobby. I believe Jay noted that he drove up and saw Adnan by the pay phone before the infamous trunk pop happened.. If you claim to have seen someone - I am pretty sure you remember whether or not they were inside or outside. Also, if the trunk pop happened - and it's cold/winter - why would Adnan be sitting by the phones when he could be sitting in a car? AND - why would he call Jay to come get him at that time when he still had a car to dispose of? Did they just leave it at Best Buy? I guess I don't remember that part? That said - if it's just a mistake that Jay said phones outside and he meant inside...didn't Jay also claim that Adnan called and said something along the lines of ""that bitch is dead, come get me.""?... yea, I'm sure someone would say that.. from the lobby of a popular store.. in the middle of the day.

xjasonlx	19	0	None of Jay's stories have him dropping off Adnan at track (or picking him up from track) at the appropriate times. We know that Adnan had his cell back at 5:00 because he calls his voicemail. Jay's inconsistencies point to Jay lying about Adnan being with him during that time period in an effort to include Adnan in events that he was not present for. Jay knew he had to include getting Adnan back to track because he was afraid of witnesses coming forward and testifying to that. Jay's claim that Adnan needed an alibi for that time doesn't make sense either. Why does Adnan need an alibi from 4-5 well after the murder took place. Jay never dropped Adnan off at track because Adnan didn't leave school/library after 2:15 and therefore didn't need to be dropped off. Jay's stories also show him consistently trying to fabricate an alibi for his own whereabouts during the time of the murder.	20141128T182739

anonymous	1	0	Interesting things I gleaned from this timeline: 1) We finally get a semi-definitive time for track practice. The track coach testified that practice was from 4:00-5:30 or 6:00. Does this cast any doubt on Adnan checking his voicemail at 5? (Another thread suggested that those calls on the log are actually incoming calls being routed to voicemail.) 2) Adnan was 37 mins late to his psychology class. Does this lend more credibility to Jay's account that they were at the mall together? This does make Adnan's account, in which Jay drops him off at 11:30, more confusing. What was Adnan doing at school during his free period that would make him miss half of psychology class? 3) In all of Jay's timelines, he drops Adnan off late for track. This jives with his police interview, in which he states that Adnan says he ran extra for being late. Many have commented that this would make the practice more memorable for the coach and others if true, but I'm not sure that's reason enough to disbelieve it. After all, the coach said Adnan was probably there, but couldn't say with enough certainty to swear to it in court -- which would take a lot of certainty, IMO, in the absence of written records of attendance, etc. Plus, track isn't like a team sport, where everyone is practicing together. I'm not sure one student being late and running extra would have been very noticeable or disruptive to other students doing their own individual workouts. 4) Jay's third timeline seems to be about an hour off. This doesn't seem that surprising to me; I have a similarly fuzzy concept of time on unstructured days, even without smoking pot. If anything, this slight discrepancy makes me doubt the theory that Jay's testimony was doctored to fit the prosecution's case. If that were true, wouldn't it fit the official timeline more seamlessly?	20141129T161503

anonymous	7	0	I don't buy the whole Adnan needed an alibi and therefore I dropped him off at track. Wouldn't Jay be Adnan's alibi?

Jay's story (first and second versions) imply that he got Adnan to track *very* late, which is pretty odd - I'd assume the coach would have remembered if he were so late. And, if I'm reading this right, it looks like Jay doesn't even mention taking Adnan to track practice at all in his second trial testimony - this seems like a really big detail to leave out!	20141128T223440
mrmiffster	16	0	This is consistent with Jay's story that they both go to the mall and Jay drops Adnan off at school after 1 pm.	20141128T183908
balmergrl	5	0	Since Hae didn't go missing until much later, I don't understand why is this time discrepancy is a factor? What am I missing?	20141128T191322

anonymous	3	0	"> Where are you getting that from? Adnan uses a lot of ""would haves"" to avoid getting caught in a lie. Before the Asia thing he said 'I would often go to the library,' then later said he remembered seeing Asia. Also, his defense tried to say he was at the mosque, but I've never seen/heard Adnan say ""I was at the mosque"" and there don't seem to be any witnesses to this other than his father. For a popular guy Adnan seems to be able to go to busy places where very few people remember him."	20141128T184530
balmergrl	4	0	Agreed - but I'm ignoring the discrepancies in the 12:07 & 12:41 calls versus the various stories about the sequence of arrival at Jen's, since this time of day has no bearing on Hae's disappearance and there's no way to know which if any of these stories is true based on what I've seen... In one of her statements, Jen said that she/Jay went shopping, so that could explain why the cell isn't pinging the towers by her house. But, I also prefer to ignore the tower mapping, since the science is murky. Also, I have a hard time believing anyone would say +/- 45-mins exactly what time they did anything even yesterday, so I give some leeway to the shifting timelines. HMMM... Just thought of a plausible scenario for Jay to call Jen's house while he/Jen are together: If they go out, her bro is home alone. We know Jen only has a pager, so maybe she/they'd use Adnan's cell to check on him. That's not in any of the statements I've seen, but the only glimmer of hope I can think to save Jay's alibi. Anyone know if/what Jen's bro ever corroborated? For the record, I'm not on anyone's side here. I got sucked into Serial cuz I do get a lil homesick for Bmore, it's a crAzy place to grow up for sure and the very best training in street smarts you'll ever get - THANK YOU and happy holidays Bmore :-)	20141128T211210
prettikitti89	6	0	Yup!	20141128T185729
anonymous	2	0	I guess because it might suggest that Adnan could be lying about going out to the mall with Jay that morning.... the thing is, when I look at Jay's court testimony, he seems to be saying he called Jenn at 12:07 when he was driving away from the high school after dropping Adnan off - this confirms Adnan's story that he didn't go to the mall with Jay. It's all pretty confusing.	20141128T221826
anonymous	14	0	"Do you see how saying ""would have"" is different from a ""shifting story""? For example: * ""Would have:"" I would have walked home from work if it was a Wednesday; I usually only drive on Mondays. I guess sometimes I drive on Wednesdays, but usually I walk, so I probably would have walked home that Wednesday. * Shifting story: On Wednesday, I biked home from work. On Wednesday, I took a helicopter home from work. On Wednesday, I walked home from work. On Wednesday, I rollerbladed home from work."	20141128T184934
therealjjohnson	3	0	The reason i think it matters is this: If he really went to the mall with Jay and got the bracelet for stephanie then there is no reason for Jay to have his car anymore. He should have taken it back. If he didn't take it back they why leave your car and phone with Jay? Was there really a plan all along?	20141129T002517

anonymous	2	0	I can see (potentially) that he might leave the car with jay as a favor, since he had to be in class anyways. I think that the biggest reason that this detail is relevant is because that moment is supposedly when Adnan told Jay he was planning on killing Stephanie.	20141129T011753
KanKan669	3	0	"I used to think that too. But recently I asked my parents and a few friends (who are unaware of Serial) what they were doing on the date 6 weeks prior. Let me tell you, by their answers you would have thought they WERE Adnan. Every answer was ""well, I was probably..."" ""At that time I usually..."" ""I most likely would have..."" Try it yourself. It's really hard to remember something that long ago if you have no cause to remember it. It works either way with Adnan. He could be intentionally ""forgetful"" because he murdered her, or he could be actually forgetful because the day was just like every other day."	20141128T210516
dev1anter	6	0	"Depends what inconsistencies. If it's 7 versions of where Adnan showed him Hae's body it's just plain bullshitting, not an inconsistency. When you say you were at Patapsco and watched the sunset while smoking weed and then say you never went there .. it's not an inconsistency. But if at Ramandan you go to the mosque every night for a month and they ask you.. Listen, on that day [out of 20 or 30] did you go there? You're not really sure [maybe you skipped it] but you say ""It was ramadan and my father was fasting so i'd probably would've gone at the mosque to bring him some food]. See, there's a big difference."	20141128T192053
anonymous	2	0	Well, I guess we just disagree. I think it's far more common to think about what you were likely to be doing, and go from there, than to clearly remember doing 1 thing, and later clearly remember doing something completely different.	20141128T191153
therealjjohnson	2	0	Yeah. Once they finished shopping if Jay asked to keep the car it seems like Adnan would have remembered that. Wait, Adnan doesn't remember anything. SMH.	20141130T005950

anonymous	3	0	I've seen several posts here from defense attorneys here saying that if you can't discredit the state's witness then you need to provide a good account of why it couldn't be you. This explains the effort to discredit Jay. Adnan is unable to substantiate his Alibi so Jay has to be discredited.	20141128T192436
anonymous	3	0	"But I think it's pretty accurate that if he were innocent, he wouldn't have a clear memory. i just tested this - I looked back 6 weeks on my calender, and all of the memories I could come up with are ""I might haves"" or ""I would haves."" For example, I might have hung out with my friends after school that day, but I wouldn't really remember this unless one of them could supply a memory of us hanging out that day. If someone said we watched a movie that afternoon, the memory would come back once I thought about the movie. That seems to be a pretty accurate function of memory. Then again, maybe he is just lying, and leaving everything loose like that is easier for him."	20141128T223832
anonymous	2	0	Now try the same process for last Friday. Because at the one week mark of Hae being missing he was asked About his day twice by the police.	20141128T233019
anonymous	1	0	Right but if you had been called by a cop yesterday at 5 PM about one of your most intimate relations gone missing it would bring that day into clear focus.

anonymous	2	0	"tbh it's pretty much the same. I have a few more details, but it's mostly still ""would haves"" and maybes. Definitely not detailed or clear."	20141128T233841
anonymous	1	0	I think it is plausible that, as ADnan says to SK, he didn't really take that call seriously. I mean, he knew Hae's parents were really strict, and at that point she's only been missing for 3 or 4 hours. That could be scary to some people, but not scary to others. It's one of the many details in this case that can be interpreted both ways.	20141129T012310
anonymous	1	0	That seems highly unlikely, especially when he found out later she was not back at school next week.	20141129T013329
anonymous	1	0	I do agree that this is suspicious. Though I can also see the validity of his claim that he was getting information through his friends. If he did believe that she was just in cali or something, he might not have been too worried.	20141129T020842
anonymous	1	0	right, but also if he believed she was in Cali you would think he would call her phone immediately. not saying this is a must either way, but if he didn't take the call seriously, you would think he might just call Hae to be sure?	20141129T023906
anonymous	2	0	I know I definitely would have tried to call her. But it's just one of those things that can be interpreted either way. Suspicious, yes. Damning, not necessarily.	20141129T024258
anonymous	1	0	OK that' fair. But keep in mind that Hae did not just not turn up home that day. She DID NOT PICK UP HER COUSIN FROM DAYCARE AT 3:15. Now not turning up to pick a kid up from Day Care is a very big deal. It's not like she forgot an appointment.	20141129T063524
anonymous	1	0	Did Adnan know that's what she was planning on doing? That may have made a difference. Also, just a reminder that it sounded like none of their friends were very worried at first - they all assumed that she'd gone to Cali or run off with Don. So in that context it makes sense that he might not have been too worried for those first few days.	20141129T063724
anonymous	1	0	"According to Jay (don't laugh, this is his first account, before the cops twisted things to fit their incorrect time-line, and there is no obvious reason why he would say this with an ulterior motive) ...

Jay: Ah he said that Hae didn't pick up her cousin, that they already looking for her"" But he would *very likely* (I can't say anything definite of course!) have heard it over the next few days. The only person who says this was no problem, on record, I believe, was Stephanie, Jay's girlfriend and Adnan's friend."	20141129T085954

bluueit12	1	0	I mean......where did Adnan do it? You have one witness that sees Hae leaving alone, another that saw her after the time of murder, another that saw Adnan at the library and another that saw him headed to the guidance office in track clothes. We have no idea how or when he got into her car. The prosecution never offers an explanation other than 'he asked for a ride', which Hae turned down.	20141129T013318
SerialClaireS	1	0	Who knows where... It is possible she was struck & maybe unconscious before the actual strangulation took place, which could make it easier to believe that could have happened in a more public place ( library, best buy) & then perhaps she was driven to a more secluded area?	20141128T155257
GauchoBearBulldog	6	0	"Right. The ""Jay did it"" theory requires either 1) Jay knowing where Hae would be and that he somehow got her to stop and interact with him long enough and in a secluded enough place to commit the crime, or 2) they happened to run into each other in a secluded place and he either committed the crime in the heat of the moment (assuming there was an altercation) or decided that was the moment to act on a previous motivation to kill her (some have suggested that Hae planned to confront Jay about him cheating on Stephanie)."	20141128T170118

htownhustla	2	0	It doesn't seem like Jay was a drug dealer where he kept his own stash and could bag up an 1/8 for you if you called him, but more of a drug intermediary who knew who to call if you wanted some. This is based on all the accounts of J&A driving around the area trying to find weed. Also, just from personal experience, most drug dealers aren't the most responsive people, so if you texted your guy, you probably aren't getting a reply right away. I know this is pure speculation, but it doesn't seem likely to me that even if Hae was looking to score some pot for Don time later (which is completely speculative itself), she would attempt it in the narrow window between school and picking up the cousin.	20141128T191157
GauchoBearBulldog	1	0	I would be interested in hearing more about where this speculation came from. The 2:36 call pinged the tower and dish serving the area just south of Woodlawn High and the Best Buy, but it was only 5 seconds long. If it were Hae calling Jay then they would have had to have had a plan already worked out earlier in the day to meet there after school and that would have been her signalling to him that she was on her way there or already there. Maybe she would have been calling him from the very pay phone that's existence is still in question? The 3:15 call - which is the next one in the call log - pings the tower that serves the Best Buy, indicating that Jay was in that area if he still had Adnan's cell phone.	20141128T180142
GauchoBearBulldog	1	0	"But if she did see him ""out and about"" then it would have had to be directly on the way to picking up her cousin, and I can't imagine a series of events that would have brought them into contact during this time, absent the plan mentioned in this thread about buying weed."	20141128T193247

What is the narrative that brings the two of them together at the same time and place and gives him the opportunity, especially if she was on her way to pick up her niece/cousin?	20141128T155841
cthulhu8	2	0	I imagine a blow strong enough to knock someone unconscious would have shown up in forensics? Plus Jay stated that Adnan supposedly said Hae kicked and broke the turn signal lever in the car while he was strangling her. I would hope that the cops confirmed that statement. If so, she couldn't have been unconscious. EDIT: Turn signal. thanks for confirmation	20141128T192047
The-Real-J-Peterman	3	0	Which call is that? The 2:36 call that's 5 seconds long? That only makes sense if she realizes it's Jay and hangs up. Not enough time to set up a meeting, nor is it enough time to confront Jay (if you believe the cheating narrative).	20141128T202939
The-Real-J-Peterman	3	0	"Agree, there's no solid link either way (one could argue that these accounts at least support the idea that Adnan was TRYING to get alone with her). But it requires a smaller suspension of disbelief (to me at least) to believe that Adnan got to Hae somehow as both were leaving from school versus the alternative narrative of Jay either staking out Hae at school or coincidentally encountering her on the road and both stopping. And again, that's my problem with the ""Jay did it"" theory. It would have to be some combination of completely unverified motives/actions or extraordinary coincidence for Jay to intercept Hae in that narrow time window."	20141128T221510
The-Real-J-Peterman	3	0	But why is he looking for her in the first place? He doesn't have any reason to stalk her out at the school parking lot. Unless one believes that he preemptively murdered Hae to prevent her from revealing Jay's alleged infidelities? That's quite a stretch.	20141128T203131
ShrimpChimp	1	0	"Why does she have to buy weed. She could stop anywhere for any reason (other than stepping out) and find herself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

bluueit12	1	0	I know this but it's also been said that the library was more public than the Best Buy parking lot, so the probability of her being killed there is even smaller.	20141129T210652

anonymous	2	0	While hanging out in the morning, Adnan mentions that he told Hae about Jay's hookups on the phone the night before. Jay gets pissed.

One hurdle the ""Jay did it""ers can't get me over is if Jay's cheating is his motive, why doesn't Adnan fixate on that in his defense? If your scenario happened, wouldn't Adnan immediately point the finger at Jay, ""I told him Hae knew about his cheating, and Jay became furious at her!"" Adnan is obviously pretty in touch with his friends socially (reminding Jay to get a bday present, thinking of teasing Asia's ex-bf that she may be giving it up to her new one, etc), so if Jay was either really worried about his alleged infidelity being revealed or enraged that Hae (or anyone else) had leaked it, I think Adnan would be pretty clued in. Instead he plays dumb with the ""Jay?!? What do you mean Jay?!?"" act, and he tells SK outright he never thought Jay had any reason for animosity towards him"	20141128T214643

If you're someone who believes that the State did a good job arguing that Jay's testimony was ""consistent"" and 100% born out by cell tower pings, and that the defense did a relatively poor job creating a cogent counter-narrative. Adnan's trial was the place where people heard a similar set of evidence more from the perspective of Jay and the police and arrived at a drastically different conclusion.

Muzorra	3	0	It doesn't really. It gives much needed complexity to the surface level of these kinds of incidents we sadly hear about every day. Every news story where people just accept the verdict, or are out calling for someone's head simply for being accused, is far far scarier.	20141128T193839
sjeannep	5	0	I wonder if the concluding point of Serial will be how difficult it is to know what happened in a situation that you didn't actually witness. I find myself convinced of Adnan's guilt every time I hear him talking and convinced Jay did it alone every time I read or listen to his testimony. They both seem less believable to me when I encounter them expressing themselves. Ultimately, I think that may say more about my suspicious nature than anything else.	20141128T200412

partymuffell	7	0	I don't think there is an effort to manipulate but good storytelling plays with our emotions and SK is very talented at that. I bet that a majority of listeners sided with Adnan after episode 1 and it's hard to give up on him on an emotional level once you have started to want him to be innocent. That's what happened to me at least...	20141128T191025
partymuffell	5	0	Yeah, it didn't work with me either eventually but it took me a while to realize the evidence against him was in fact much stronger than suggested in the podcast. I binge listened to the first 7 episodes twice in one day :-) And I was trying to discount all the evidence against him and at a certain point I had to let go of the idea that he's innocent! It wasn't easy because SK really makes you root for him. Many people still seem to be doing that...	20141129T022959

andrewcortex	7	0	This is a great comment, but basing things off your own experiences (I assume that's what you mean by 'character opinions') can be subjective too. I think the anti-Adnan camp listens to him and hears someone they've once trusted whom took advantage of them while the pro-Adnan camp hears somebody whom has been taken advantage of. I think once you've had those kind of experiences personally, it is difficult to look at this from a different lense. Not saying there's anything we can do about it, but worth thinking about before we attack each other or label them as idiots for thinking one thing or another.	20141128T192422

One of the two outcomes of the vote is *correct*, and each voter has an independent probability *p* of voting for the correct decision. The theorem asks how many voters we should include in the group. The result depends on whether *p* is greater than or less than 1/2: > >* If *p* is greater than 1/2 (each voter is more likely to vote correctly), then adding more voters increases the probability that the majority decision is correct. In the limit, the probability that the majority votes correctly approaches 1 as the number of voters increases. >* On the other hand, if *p* is less than 1/2 (each voter is more likely than not to vote incorrectly), then adding more voters makes things worse: the optimal jury consists of a single voter. > > --- ^Interesting: [^Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) ^| [^Peyton ^Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Young) ^| [^Majority ^rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule) ^| [^Kemeny–Young ^method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemeny%E2%80%93Young_method) ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cmfgtb9) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cmfgtb9)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)	20141128T190833

bluueit12	1	0	"That's almost like a person saying ""I don't have to worry about Doctor visits b/c cancer/diabetes/etc would never happen to me"". Being falsely accused isn't something you plan for. It just happens and then habits you don't even give a second thought to are looked at as suspicious. There's even been here where people try to see if they can remember where they were 6 weeks ago. I don't disagree with the original point being unsettling but I don't think that is what is most scariest about this story."	20141129T010954
bluueit12	2	0	Right but how do you know who's a good defense attorney and who isn't (until it's too late)? Murder defense lawyers isn't something people use everyday. Most would go off recommendations, like Adnan's parents presumably did and he still got screwed.	20141129T210437

anonymous	5	0	That's exactly my struggle. The state's case rested on the testimony of a serial liar, poorly substantiated cell phone records, and a motive cobbled together based on stereotypes about Muslim men. There's very little hard evidence of anything. Statistically, intimate partners are very likely to be the guilty parties when women go missing or are found dead. So while I totally understand looking into Adnan, and would probably assume he did it if I just read about the case in passing, I am totally unconvinced by the information presented at trial. I go back and forth on whether I think he did it, but even if he did, I don't buy the state's version of what happened.	20141129T014707

joppy77	6	0	Except that health problems are statistically far, far more likely to happen to a given person than being falsely accused of murder is. So everyone should be concerned about health, because that will affect us all (assuming we don't die in an accident or homicide/suicide before our health begins to fail). But to walk around concerned that some day you might be falsely accused of murder is an illogical fear. I mean, it's not very good to go through life worrying about every conceivable negative thing that could happen to you, no matter how statistically unlikely they are to happen to us as individuals. That was my only point.	20141129T014552
Rebar4Life	1	0	Definitely.

Why would he lie about everything else, but tell the truth about this damning detail — when he could just as easily have said instead that he let Jay borrow his phone that evening? Or even just say that he “might’ve” let Jay borrow his phone? Why would Adnan make such a bold-faced lie about going to mosque that evening (when there could potentially be dozens of witnesses who could confirm that he did not go to mosque), but then not go a tiny step further and say he doesn’t remember having his phone, but he frequently lent it out to Jay, and might have done so that night?	20141129T081546

8shadesofgray	2	0	Two possible reasons I can initially think of: - Jenn shares that Jay was worried about his footprints being found in Adnan's car. She might want to avoid doing anything that would increase a more thorough investigation for physical evidence in his car. - Jenn seems, at least to me, to really be struggling with the details of this scene - either because she's nervous or it's hard to remember in vivid detail or because it never happened. She seems to start to recount Adnan getting out of the car before settling on him staying put in the driver's seat and briefly talking to her from there. Once she's settled on him remaining in his car, being able to give a detailed account of the state of his clothing through his car window from her car window - in a parking lot at night - would possibly look like a red flag.	20141128T163959

dixjours	10	0	"Your analysis is flawed, and is an excellent illustration of why we decide cases in courts of law rather than through popularity polls. ""Most"" cases are most certainly not this shoddy on evidence, and certainly not ""most"" homicide cases. The state's entire case relied on a lying snitch. Said snitch admitted to committing the crime of conspiracy to commit murder yet got no jail time for it, which the jury was never told. The lack of physical evidence to corroborate his timeline, which has already been dismantled, is disturbing. Notwithstanding the sloppy analysis of evidence we've all witnessed here on reddit, it is noteable that every single lawyer questioned in this podcast to date, including a survey of multiple unnamed lawyers that Koenig interviewed but did not quote in episode 1, agrees that the conviction was flawed. To date there is not one lawyer cited in the podcast who has attempted to defend the conviction. Not one. The primary basis for this conclusion is Gutierrez's failure to interview Asia McLain, which is a completely inexcusable act of incompetence that was unconfirmed until Koenig interviewed her for this very podcast. It will be interesting to see how the appellate court addresses the state's position on why that failure should not be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel that merits, at least, a new trial."	20141128T212306
cheetah__heels	31	0	"It annoys me that people seem to think that details do not matter. ""The backbone of Jay's testimony stayed consistent"". Of course it stayed consistent, the only thing he's really saying is that Adnan killed Hae and buried her body in Leakin Park. You can craft any fictional story you'd like around those points. How can he waver from that? Saying anything else would incriminate himself. All of the *details* about literally everything is grey area. He lies about where he was during the murder/abduction timeline (Jenn's house vs Woodlawn area), where he sees the body and about Jenn's level of knowledge. Most of the day is spent calling people ***he*** knows. I care very much about how much Jay lies."	20141128T171530
Hopper80	15	0	We know Jay lied and lied and lied, but apart from that we can trust him, because c'mon, it's common sense? One person's common sense is another's maundering bollocks. Jay said Adnan killed Hae. He also said a lot of stuff which he changed his mind on, a lot of stuff that doesn't add up. Oddly, the one thing he hasn't changed his mind on is that Adnan definitely killed Hae, and that it definitely wasn't himself. He was ok to paint himself being someone who aware of an impending murder and agreed beforehand to help dispose of the body and then doing so, told varying stories on the theme of 'Adnan killed Hae. Trunk Pop. Burial', his stories of what happened that day (to the cops and acquaintencies) changed time and again, only coming to some sort of focus with the help of the police showing him the time logs. Apart from that, there's every reason to take seriously his saying that Adnan did it. I don't doubt there are crimes that happen for which I could be said to have a motive, and where I couldn't account for my time. The idea that I might be convicted on the shifting testimony of a lying drug dealer whose one constant is the assertion that I did it, is a nightmare. Whether or not Adnan did it, that witness can go fuck himself.	20141128T191837
j2kelley	19	0	"I can argue that the premise for your argument is wrong: >Jay was involved in Hae's disappearance; a girl he knew through her ex-boyfriend. This seems to imply that Jay only knew Hae through Adnan, which is not true. He went to school with her the year prior and sat next to her in at least one class (biology). His girlfriend was fairly good friends with her - good enough that she was (allegedly) pissed Jay cheated and considered confronting him about it. *And* his girl was best friends with Adnan, making Jay, along with Hae, part of the same circle of friends - in 1998, anyway. Point is: He knew her directly. I'd even go as far to say it appears she *was* intimately connected to him - through the intense relationship he had with his girlfriend. >found intimately murdered...on a day the ex-boyfriend was seen by multiple people lying in order to gain access to the girl's car. We do *not* know this. We only know Adnan lent Jay his car that day and (allegedly) didn't expect it back until after track. We also know, because of this fact, it's possible Adnan asked Hae for a ride after school (as he had an hour to burn before track started) and - if that happened - she supposedly turned him down. Nowhere is it indicated that he was ""seen by multiple people lying (to get in her) car."" This is the only actual statement I could find on the record in this regard (so please edify me if you have other sources): >[Episode 2, 32:30] >Becky: ""I do remember that there was talk about it. I remember I felt like he asked her to give him a ride somewhere."" >SK: ""OK. [reading from police notes of Becky's interview on April 9th:] 'Sometime earlier that day, apparently he asked her to take him, possibly to get car, before lunch, because it was in the shop. Heard about it at lunch...Hae said she could, there would be no problem. At end of school, I saw them. She said, 'Oh no I can't take you. I have something else to do.' She didn't say what else. That happened at approximately 2:20. He said, 'Okay, I'll just ask someone else.' He told her, 'Goodbye.' And then she says, 'Did not see Hae after that.'"" So, essentially, what we actually know is that: Jay was involved in Hae's disappearance, a girl he knew, who was found intimately murdered on the same day he borrowed her ex-boyfriend's car and phone; a murder that - based on his testimony alone - the ex-boyfriend would be later charged with."	20141128T181426

I know that's what drives me nuts, that a conviction was made based on what the prosecution brought forth. I couldn't say if Adnan is guilty or not, but I don't believe he should be sitting in jail based on the case presented. I really feel that the jury failed him, and really all of us that day.

Think of it this way: you don't even need Jay's testimony to make a case against Adnan. It may not be enough to get beyond reasonable doubt, but the circumstances and Adnan's own words alone make it more probable than not that he was involved in the murder.	20141128T204744

After that SK asks Adnan about that particular call and Adnan states that that would imply a third party, and who would that be. In a later episode SK mentions that this call would have been Aisha to which Adnan replies that he specifically remembers getting this call as he was a teenager who was high and that's not something he could forget.

whitenoise2323	4	0	"Adnan said he wouldn't ever forget being called by the police when he was high. He received three calls at ""Kathy's"" house, currently being theorized as one from Hae's brother asking if Adnan had seen Hae, one from Aisha saying Hae was missing and the cops were looking for her, and a third one from Detective Adcock asking about Hae. If there is one thing that it appears everyone agrees on it's that Adnan was super stoned, falling asleep on the floor at 7pm off by himself zoning out stoned, at this point. When Hae's brother called it could've been just brushed off. After Aisha called Adnan got upset that the cops might call him because he was super high. And then he remembered talking to the cops. So, the Aisha call could've been eclipsed in his memory by the paranoid **COPS** alarm going off in his stoned teenage brain. 15 years later he's trying to explain to SK what ""Kathy"" was talking about when she said he got some call that made him panic. He takes on ""Kathy's"" logic about the incident to attempt to address it. It seems less like an inconsistency and more like a case of faulty memory and Adnan being high."	20141128T171646
pennyparade	2	0	There are a few discrepancies in Adnan's accounts. Most notably the one I mentioned about asking Hae for a ride (corroborated by Krista and Becky) and then later denying asking. We don't even have Adnan's interview statements to pick apart. If we are going to approach this from an assumption of innocence, that should apply to Jay as well. Most people seem to be *looking* for a reason Jay would have done this alone or with a third party when the evidence (to me at least) suggests he had an accomplice and that accomplice was most likely Adnan.	20141128T200519

lukaeber	2	0	That is NOT how the system is supposed to work. The question is not who put on the best case. The question is did the PROSECUTION meet its burden of proof. The only case that had to be proved was the prosecutions. The defense surely could have done a better job poking holes in the prosecution's case, but the defense doesn't even have to put on a case at all if the prosecution doesn't meet its burden. The prosecution's case was a story told by a known liar that almost certainly contained several blatant untruths and incomplete cell-phone evidence that most experts now consider to be junk science. I find it sad that you would care so little about justice as to say something like the credibility of Jay doesn't matter. Jay's credibility WAS the prosecutions case. It is crucial. Adnan doesn't have the burden of proving that he was innocent. You can't prove a negative.	20141129T043757

Quote from transcript from Episode 2:** ""Sarah Koenig The trouble for Adnan is that a couple of their friends say he did ask Hae for a ride. One of them was her friend Krista. Krista If I remember correctly (laugh) I think Adnan and I were taking-- ah, had a class together, um our first period class was Photography, and she-- they passed each other in the hallway and I was with him and I remember somebody saying or him saying something about “Can you give me a ride after school?” Sarah Koenig Their friend Becky told police she heard something about a ride as well. Becky I do remember that there was talk about it. I remember it felt like he asked her to give him a-- give him a ride somewhere. Sarah Koenig Okay. Can I just read to you what the police notes say, I think April 9, 1999 they interviewed you. Becky Mm-hmm. Sarah Koenig So, it says, “Sometime earlier that day, apparently he asked her to take him possibly to get car before lunch because it was in the shop. Heard about it at lunch.” So it’s I think, you heard about it at lunch. Becky --yeah that sounds right. Sarah Koenig “Hae said she could, there would be no problem. At end of school I saw them. She said ‘Oh no I can’t take you, I have something else to do.’ She didn’t say what else. Approximately 2:20.” So that happened at approximately 2:20. “He said, ‘Okay I’ll just ask someone else.’ He told her goodbye.” And then it just says, “Did not see Hae after that.” Becky Okay. Yeah that sounds right. It kind of all comes back a little bit."" **Adnan confirms it the first time he speaks to police, THEN later denies it:** [Sarah Koenig] And in fact the most damning evidence in support of Jay’s statement doesn’t even come from Krista or Becky. It comes directly from Adnan because he himself told the cops the same thing that day. Court Official At this time the State would call Police Officer Scott Adcock to the stand. Sarah Koenig Around 6:30 p.m., after Hae had gone missing, a baltimore county police officer named Scott Adcock called Adnan’s cellphone. Hae’s family was worried that she hadn’t turned up to her cousin’s school and the officer was calling around to some of her friends to see if they knew where she was. Here’s Adcock testifying at trial. Scott Adcock I spoke to Mr. Syed and he advised me that, ah, he did see the victim in school that day, and that um, he was supposed to get a ride home from the victim, but he got detained at school and she just got tired of waiting and left. Sarah Koenig Then, a little more than two weeks after the call with Officer Adcock, on February 1, by this time the search for Hae has ramped up, a different detective calls. Asks Adnan about the ride thing. Asks him “did you tell Officer Adcock you’d asked Hae for a ride?” According to the police report, “Adnan says this was incorrect because he drives his own car to school. So, he reverses himself. Why would he do that? """	20141128T193212
anonymous	2	0	To be fair, one of the main goals of the podcast is to bring to light evidence or information that was left out of the trial. I personally don't agree with OP's interpretation, but you can't say that info doesn't count if it wasn't included at trial - especially since we've been able to overturn so much of the info that was included in trial.	20141129T002900
pennyparade	1	0	That Jay lacked a meaningful connection to Hae is not a statistic. That Jay and Adnan shared a car on the day of the crime is not a statistic. That Jay and Adnan shared a cellphone on the day of the crime is not a statistic. That Jay and Adnan shared company on the day of the crime is not a statistic. That Adnan tried to get into Hae's car on the day of the crime is not a statistic. I'm using this evidence, PLUS the statistical probability that a woman will be killed by a current or ex-intimate partner. Why would you say I'm only using statistics? Or even more hyperbolic, that I'm advocating convictions based on statistics?	20141130T024316
pennyparade	3	0	The alternative is to believe that Jay killed Adnan's ex-girlfriend, in an intimate manner, using Adnan's car and cellphone, on a day he spent partly in the company of Adnan, and on that same day, coincidentally, Adnan lies to Hae about needing a ride just before she goes missing, because........?	20141128T185835
pennyparade	-2	0	You consider that a detail and not a key piece of evidence? It comes from both Becky and Krista right after Hae disappears (unlike Jay neither has been caught lying) and Adnan himself corroborates it in his first convo with police. He later denies it which I find even more suspicious. We'll just have to disagree on what constitutes a detail.	20141128T191347
pennyparade	3	0	It's not hearsay if you witness a conversation which Krista says she did. It's hearsay if you are told about a conversation after the fact - Becky's statement seems to qualify as hearsay. But it doesn't matter because hearsay is often admissible if it involves a dead person who cannot testify to the conversation.	20141128T201554
pennyparade	5	0	It's not hearsay. Becky tells the police right after Hae's disappearance that he asked for a ride. She tells police she heard Adnan say his car was in the shop to Hae. Krista confirms this as well. Adnan actually admits to asking for this ride in his first convo with the police. He later reverses his story. I've provided the quotes above.	20141128T194039
Em_malik	0	0	> uncorroborated hearsay exactly. we have no proof that there was any intention for him to need a ride from Hae then. Which OP points out that is a reason to indicate Adnan is the murderer.	20141128T191633

pennyparade	1	0	Yes, it is possible that Jay killed Hae intimately, a girl he barely knew, on a day he shared a car, cellphone, and company with her ex-boyfriend, on a day her ex-boyfriend was seen lying in order to gain access to Hae's car. But it's unlikely.	20141128T173237
pennyparade	1	0	This is simply untrue. People are found guilty without a body, a murder weapon, a crime scene, when the DNA doesn't match, when there is no eyewitness account, etc. I'm not saying the system isn't flawed. I'm just saying there is nothing about this particular case that stands out as a miscarriage of justice.	20141128T215457
justmypiece	1	0	That's a very good question, but at the same time, aren't those two objectives generally inextricably intertwined? that when an innocent person is convicted, it more often than not means that a guilty person has gone free....?	20141128T212242
Dr__Nick	2	0	Too much of a coincidence. Jay and random person Jay knows commit the crime, luckily for them innocent Adnan has no alibi, no recollection of the night, doesn't remember not having his cell phone on him.... Way too unlikely.	20141128T205524
pennyparade	1	0	Cops and prosecution stop searching for evidence once they feel they have a strong enough case to win at trial. That is their benchmark. If you have a problem with that, it extends beyond this case.	20141128T175911

In this case it worked because they couldn't yet directly implicate Adnan, and he would *not* implicate himself.	20141128T224354

Cabin11	4	0	"Yeah, this has always been weird to me. Lending the car to Jay gives him a reason to need a ride from Hae. Admitting to the cops that he asked her for a lift could have seemed inconsequential to him at the time of Adcock's first interview. He may have even felt it was necessary, thinking that others overheard him asking Hae. But when he retracts, he strangely uses the excuse ""I drive my own car to school."" Be he knows he didn't have his own car that day, so this becomes suspiciously circular."	20141128T200108
j2kelley	3	0	"To be fair, I was fine with simply debating OP's claim that a few classmates' vague references to Adnan asking for a ride was actual evidence of his criminal intent. OP then pushed his premise into the courtroom, and thus I felt compelled to address that as well. >""After (the car and cellphone coincidence/motive) comes the damning bit of testimony about trying to get a ride with Hae and his recanting of it."" ...Just calling it like I see it: The ride-ruse speculation is not evidence, and it was not testified to at trial. So, like, OP should not be arguing it as such. Am I allowed to say *that*?"	20141129T022127
j2kelley	6	0	"You are, seemingly, the only one in this comment thread who accepts - as fact - that Adnan lied to get in Hae's car that day, and it poisons the rest of your theory. I suggest you properly qualify such hearsay (whether it's legit in your mind or not) every time you cite it (e.g., ""probably, ""supposedly,"" ""may have,"" ""allegedly,"" etc.), then re-access the strength of your argument."	20141128T230109
whitenoise2323	3	0	"Maybe ""my car is in the shop"" is a code that Hae, Adnan, and Jay use for picking up drugs. Jay says in his first interview that ""his only contact with Appellant (Adnan) on January 13 was at 2:00 p.m. when Appellant called him and asked for directions to a shop in East Baltimore."" He recanted this all of course in subsequent interviews. So he ""asks for a ride"" meaning that Hae should go do the pickup. When officer Adcock calls him at Kathy's he is paranoid about the drugs and stoned out of his mind (possibly high on something else) and just says he asked for a ride but that Hae said no. His stoned mind reverts to their code which is a go-to cover for what's really going on. Something goes wrong at the deal with Jay or a 3rd party and Hae is beat on the head, knocked unconscious and then strangled because the killer doesn't have a weapon."	20141128T204248

And it's evidence that whatever he asked or didn't ask, he didn't actually get in her car. The reason Jay & Jenn lying matters is because they're lying about the crucial time -- between 3 and 4 pm. Where was Jay then? They both say he was with Jenn at her house up until 3:45. But if that were true, why would he be calling her house at 3:21? Neither of them -- the people you say were definitely involved in the murder and/or its coverup -- even say that Adnan was with them during that time."	20141128T200304

Second, she didn't tell the police that she heard Adnan say that. >(from police notes of Becky's interview on April 9th): *Sometime earlier that day, apparently he asked her to take him, possibly to get car, before lunch, because it was in the shop.

In the detective's notes from the interview with Becky that April it says, ""...apparently he asked her to take him possibly to get car before lunch because it was in the shop. Heard about it at lunch.” So we've got Adnan (or ""somebody"") possibly asking for a ride from Hae early that morning - while his car would have still been in the school parking lot - and two months later we've got Becky musing in a police interview (probably after being presented with Krista's statement) that yeah, sure - she might of heard something about him needing a ride *before lunch* to get his car from the shop...or something.

Laineybin	2	0	I guess I'm missing something. Jay knows Hae was strangled, helped bury the body, had an accomplice help him get rid of the shovels and his clothes and knew where the car was...why wasn't Jay the suspect in this case? Just because he's not an ex-boyfriend???	20141128T220010
lukaeber	2	0	"What mental gymnastics? The truth is there is a huge gaping hole of missing evidence in this case. We don't know what happened. Jay tells a story that lacks credibility, but no one else offers a reasonable explanation of what happens. That doesn't make Jay's story true, or make any other story the result of ""mental gymnastics."" It just means there is a lack of evidence. I know it would be nice to have a clean alternative theory, but it isn't Adnan's responsibility to come up with an alternate theory. And, as was noted by Dierdre Enright, people who are innocent usually can't come up with a plausible alternative theory because they don't know the details of the murder. If we take the ""innocent until proven guilty"" and ""reasonable doubt"" standards seriously at all (and I sure hope we all do), then I think everyone should be appalled that Adnan is in jail right now. As someone in one episode said, there are mountains of reasonable doubt in this case. That doesn't mean that Adnan is innocent ... but he deserves the presumption that he is until the prosecution can put on a case that is based on something more than testimony that lacks credibility and junk-science cell phone records."	20141129T044846
shapshapboetie	7	0	The story which convicted Adnan also lacks hard evidence. It relies on testimony - not physical evidence - and relies on circumstantial evidence of the phone records. A different theory of the case would use those same records to come to a different conclusion.	20141128T172042
Laineybin	2	0	"Actually it's more likely than not...he admits to knowing how she was killed (and stop with the ""intimately"", she was strangled not proof of anything about who killed her, it could simply have been a murder of opportunity), helping to bury the body, disposing of shovels and clothes and he lead the police to her car - this alone makes him look like suspect number 1 to me. Be very careful when you say that Hae was someone he barely knew, because he did know her and you have no idea why she was murdered - none of us do."	20141128T220254
cheetah__heels	0	0	You only say that because Adnan is the most *likely* suspect and Jay has no motive. It sounds crazy to think that Jay premeditated this crime beforehand. But if Jay took advantage of circumstance and it was in the heat of the moment, it makes more sense. I don't know why Jay would kill Hae. But then again, I don't know why anyone would want to kill her. I don't buy that Hae wanted to confront him. Whatever happened happened because of something that we will never understand. I like to base judgement on facts. Jay lies about where he was and what he was doing during *very* key moments of the crime. Most of the calls made that day are to Jay's friends. Some people saw Adnan after school and during track. Jay has no alibi for that time period. He wants to say he was with Jenn but cell phone evidence proves otherwise.	20141128T175337
I_W_N_R	6	0	Well if you're going to deny my experience, I guess there's not much point debating you. While not every murder prosecution has every one of those things, the overwhelming majority have something more than the uncorroborated, inconsistent testimony of an admitted liar to connect the defendant to the crime. I don't know what your experience with murder prosecutions is that you think this one doesn't stand out, but it certainly doesn't jive with mine.	20141128T222205
shapshapboetie	4	0	>Cops and prosecution stop searching for evidence once they feel they have a strong enough case to win at trial. Not quite, but close enough. Anyway, that's not an excuse. What's at issue is your comfort with the prosecution's case. In the same breath that you say nobody has produced enough evidence to prove any other theory, you accept that the cops stopped looking for exculpatory evidence. Thus, we do not have evidence which was not collected. Bit of a tautology. We don't know what we don't know because that evidence was not pursued. Anyway, we don't have to produce evidence. The defense only has to knock out the state's evidence. Since they didn't, we can try it here.	20141128T181329

Was it the same Mall where Jay went to shop for a gift? We don't know, because Jay says he went to several different malls and we don't know which. Inez said she didn't see Adnan anywhere near the car. And around that time, Adnan may have been seen by the library. The police did not pursue other theories. They apparently did not test the rope, the DNA on the liquor bottle, verify the location of pay phones, etc. So, the evidence is long gone.

Your strong belief, that Hae was more likely than not killed by an intimate stranger because most women are, leads you to conclude that Adnan is the only one who fits that category and must have done it.

I'm just not convinced that strangulation is a more intimate method (in the sense you mean) versus a more immediate method. Or at least the latter can't be ruled out. It seems it is just a more common method from a male perpetrator to a female victim. For Reference: I'm on the fence regarding Mr. Syed's innocence.

jtw63017	1	0	The burden of proof shifts after the conviction. To convince me of Adnan's innocence, I need to see a tight case that says he is innocent.	20141128T181932
pennyparade	-2	0	Yes, that is how burden of proof works. Both sides present a theory. In order to discount one strong theory, juries like to hear another, even stronger theory. You might feel no one should go to jail on a theory. But that does not change the fact that physical evidence is not required to indict or convict someone.	20141128T181848
ProfessorGalapogos	1	0	I would advise you to steer clear of murder statistics as an integral premise for your argument. It is rife with subtleties. Other than that, I understand your reasoning.	20141129T015237
j2kelley	1	0	If you've got stats on hand, point me to one that shows how many victims are killed by intimate partners who used an accomplice.	20141128T220501
pennyparade	0	0	I am relying way more on the use of his car and cellphone in the commitment of the crime. That is the biggest factor for me, followed by the likelihood that Jay would have been stuck with two cars at some point. After that comes the damning bit of testimony about trying to get a ride with Hae and his recanting of it later.	20141128T212538
Em_malik	1	0	I see. So Adnan is the stronger link between Stephanie and Hae.	20141128T212232

shapshapboetie	2	0	"I'm under the impression that OP is speaking out of both sides of her mouth. OP is shifting the burden to the defense (or other redditors): prove it happened a different way. That's not how criminal trials work. It's also not how the Innocence Project or the appellate process works. Both the IP and the appellate process look for exculpatory evidence, procedural failures, etc. The evidence might be enough to bring a new trial against someone else, but we're not in any position to prove that case, much less to raise new evidence. OP is asking for someone to ""prove"" some ""more likely"" theory based on phantom evidence, which either doesn't exist or wasn't pursued. That's nearly impossible. But, since the prosecution hung their case on a liar/ accomplice/ drug dealer... it's not hard to show that it didn't happen the way the trial portrayed. By doing that, you indirectly prove it happened a different way."	20141128T181754
shapshapboetie	1	0	Yes, it shifts for a PCR. But we (redditors) don't have any new evidence to mount a PCR. OP is not asking for that kind of proof anyway. OP is lookign for proof of an alternative theory.	20141128T182215
shapshapboetie	2	0	No, that's not how the burden of proof works. Prosecution presents the case in chief to overcome the burden. Defendant doesn't have to present an alternative theory at all. They can just undercut the P's case to show P has not overcome it.	20141128T182608

pennyparade	1	0	Yes, they already did that. They presented it to a jury and the jury agreed. The defense does not have to present an alternative theory, but it's the most usual and effective way of undercutting the case. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm not discussing the trial. I'm not asserting that I would have voted one way or another. I'm simply saying that, for the purposes of an internet discussion, I'm satisfied that the simplest explanation is likely the correct one and that I'm not convinced an innocent man is in prison.	20141128T183629

Longclock	1	0	Indeed, the details of the body's position given by Jay are troubling. He did change the depth of the grave a couple times over the course of his interviews. I would concede that it would be awfully unprofessional of the cops to have shown Jay a photo of the body in situ & then ask pointed questions about it.

modalert	2	0	Back in the late Nineties, I worked in IT for Fortune 500 company. We had cameras covering all the exits to our offices on the 9th Flr. There was a VCR type recorder in the data center that recorded all the footage from the cameras. One day, some employees reported items missing from their offices after lunch. We reviewed the footage and saw a guy not dressed in business attire walk in through one of the stairwells, go down a hall, and go in and out of several people's offices. Clearly, here was our thief. However,I doubt his own mother could identify him from the best shot of him. At the time, I was surprised by how useless the whole thing system was. Years later when I saw the DVR type cameras, I was surprised how much better they were than the junk that I saw in the late Nineties.	20141128T201423
Hopper80	1	0	I was wondering that. Like SmarchHare, I want to know if they even tried. There probably wouldn't have been anything back then, but there could have been. I've got a bit of a bee in my bonnet about non-Adnan phone records that would help to make clear who called who when, and if the cops even tried - like, say, asking politely for permission - to see them. Someone mentioned you could only do that without permission with suspects - is there any reason when you have two people confessing to having foreknowledge of a murder and of having knowledge that the murder took place and who commited it, one of who helped out after and knows where the victim's body is - is that not enough to go after phone records?	20141128T221955

anonymous	2	0	today it's digital so probably yes, in 1999 it was literally TAPES they used. 730 hours of tape is a loooot of tape even at low framerate. think about it. malls, gas stations, supermarkets: they don't care about murder. they have tapes for when shit goes down in their business. How does a best buy benefit from having 4 weeks old footage? if they notice something going down on their parking lot they could check the tapes that very same day, they wouldn't wait a month	20141128T180539

mrmiffster	1	0	Ya, this stood out to me too. If Jay wanted to use Adnan's cell and car later in the evening he would've had a motive to get Adnan really messed up.

whitenoise2323	3	0	I don't know... doesn't sound like heroin to me. People on junk don't care about practically anything and Adnan seemed really worked up after he got those phone calls.

Befozz	1	0	It seems like Adnan and Jay both smoked pot fairly frequently and I would bet both had a pretty high tolerance, one blunt between two people shouldn't have made either of them nauseous. Unless they combined it with alcohol ( maybe Adnan drank that bottle of brandy), smoked a few blunts between them, Jay drugged Adnan, harder drugs were involved, etc. Adnan should not have been excessively messed up. Maybe the fasting did something to him, but I thought Adnan said he would have broken fast shortly after track practice so he probably would have eaten by the time they went to cathys	20141128T220349

kramer772661	1	0	So part of Jay's elaborate plan to frame Adnan invloves lacing a blunt with heroin to make Adnan look more guilty of murder while at Cathy's. What a criminal genius he is. I guess he disposed of the body while Adnan was comatosed in the car. You know maybe even Jay manipulated Adnan into unknowingly murdering Hae through some sort of mysterious drug combination.	20141129T093804

whitenoise2323	2	0	The description from Jay says that he felt nauseous so he sat away from the group. Kathy said he was practically passed out on her cushions. It's possible he was freaking out in his head and just pulled a sensory deprivation maneuver (shut your eyes and hope it all goes away) to try and calm down.	20141128T200936
platorithm	2	0	My first question is that with your experience of smoking a blunt, you can't understand Adnan's behaviour coming from smoking his first one? Heroin seems like a more likely explanation? I find it far more believable that Adnan smoked a blunt than that Jay found just the right mixture of drugs to keep Adnan functional, but block some of his memories, but also wouldn't leave him with the feeling that something strange, like being drugged, happened to him that night. I mean, he remembers going to Cathy's and talking to the police, but he doesn't remember details of what time he got his phone back from Jay, so he must have been drugged? It just doesn't make sense to me. Smoking a big blunt, however, does fit.	20141128T220647
Atomic190	2	0	He said they smoked (or refrained from smoking) all over the place which really makes this quote and exactly how it was said curious in the context of this particular statement. He's changed his story in many respects after conferring with the detectives for 3 hours prior to, he clearly being led by the detectives to a greater degree than the first interview, and he's inserting far fewer random details. Wouldn't Adnan be fairly used to blunt wrappers at this point?	20141128T194432
Atomic190	1	0	First, I am not implying that there are alternative explanations but I stand by my opinion that the statement is striking in delivery and under the circumstances. Adnan appears to be an experienced smoker so I do find it odd that he seemed unusually high at that moment. If it was heroin in a small amount it would have had a modest but effective influence on Adnan perception and memory retention and it would have been fairly short acting	20141128T221554

whitenoise2323	7	0	I'm also wondering about the detail in one of Jay's stories where at some point in the day he mentions that he smoked some weed but Adnan didn't because he didn't want to. Why add that detail? Is it possible that at some point Jay refrained and Adnan smoked? That Jay was trying to keep his head straight?	20141128T173455
Justreallylovespussy	5	0	Interesting idea but I think you may be reaching a bit, we have absolutely no reason to believe Adnan was drugged and it seems like a leap.	20141128T190450

anonymous	1	0	I think it's important to keep in mind that the effects of weed can be pretty unpredictable. Even an experienced smoker (like Adnan) could conceivably get wayyyyy to high, depending on whether he'd eaten, the strand of weed, how ted or dehydrated he was, etc. And the nicotine in a cigarette can easily make someone feel sick, or make them feel more high. Based on all the accounts and evidence, it seems like Adnan was just too high when he got to Kathy's house. It's a pretty scary experience, which explains why he was being so weird. And it's also kind of hard to say how it impacted his memory, because that's the kind of thing that would vary person to person, and even time to time.	20141128T233536
lkshmi108	1	0	Adnan was known for being social and charming etc. Kathy says that he didn't even speak. This is also someone who is used to getting high. I think he was drugged. Horse tranquilizer is easy to lace in weed or something that would make it really difficult to remember.	20141201T213446

They were probably close in the way these 1-dimensional relationships are close. Do you really put any stock in the fingerprint? Adnan and Hae were dating. He admitted to being in her car many times. I'm sure he helped her navigate. The fingerprint is meaningless in regard to proving anything about Hae's murder. In terms of Adnan's memory, I think Jay got him super stoned so he would forget what happened that day. The cops didn't need to engineer any of this, it was handed to them on a platter and is either meaningless or evidence of Jay's ability to frame Adnan."	20141129T021057

whitenoise2323	1	0	That's because all they did was hangout smoking weed or procuring weed. Jay was his weed hookup, not his friend. He trusted him because Jay and him would hang out breaking the law and probably looked out for each other.

serialmonotony	13	0	It strikes me that Jay seems to conspicuously remember and mention red clothes - Hae's red and blue jacket, Adnan's red gloves - but doesn't mention the colour of his own red jacket which he has disposed of.

anonymous	7	0	He also confirmed the jacket from a photo. This seemed interesting to me. If Adnan was smart he would have disposed of the jacket he was wearing when he killed Hae.

anonymous	10	0	I'm 80% certain that he did it, but don't think the state proved it. That doesn't mean, however, that I don't think the state *could* prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. I feel like the prosecution did a disservice by not checking out Jay's story more thoroughly.	20141128T175152
anonymous	8	0	I'll say the same thing I say to everyone: there just plain wasn't enough actual evidence beside one persons testimony that he did it.

LetsNotGoOverboard	3	0	I think the questions of whether Adnan did it (with or without Jay's help) and whether he should be in jail based on what we know about the investigation are two separate questions.

But I think there is certainly reasonable doubt based merely what was presented in the trial.	20141129T103707
Hopper80	7	0	There are doubtless crimes that have happened for which I could be said to have a motive, and the times of which I would have trouble remembering my whereabouts such that I could get an alibi.

Adnans_cell	2	0	I don't understand how you can weigh the feelings for a loved one and the premise of reasonable doubt. These two are at odds with each other and most would choose their loved ones even without reasonable doubt in play. It's a non-starter. The question should be as it is in our legal system, judge your peer, that you have no personal bias towards, with reasonable doubt. For Adnan, 12 jurors did this exercise in under two hours. They heard a much different telling of the story than we did, but we aren't a trial by jury, we are a mob on the Internet.	20141129T093136
Workforidlehands	1	0	"We weren't sat watching the trial unfold from the jury box so it's difficult to pass judgement on their decision. Also there's numerous threads where practicing lawyers have described it as a run of the mill murder case with enough supporting evidence to convict - which maybe perfectly true. However I find it shocking that the evidence we've seen could be considered perfectly normal quality and quantity to convict somebody for murder. The Q&Q of evidence needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt; in this case it just seems to have stumbled to the ""he might have done it"" threshold. Does anyone here think ""I'd be happy to be thrown at the mercy of that court should I be unlucky enough to be falsely accused of murder""? I'm not saying Adnan is innocent, I'm saying I haven't got a clue - and the point of a trial is to leave jurors beyond reasonable doubt. Although most of us here have no legal expertise that's kind of the point - as we are representative of the jury who all the professionals hope to persuade."	20141129T015943
goliath_franco	1	0	I think this is true, but we don't have access to all the evidence that the jury did. We're not in the position of being able to evaluate Adnan's guilt in a legal sense.

Evidence is argued and either admitted or blocked from consideration. The courtoom is about rendering a legal judgment. The prosecution's job isn't to check out Jay's story more thoroughly. Thanks to this podcast, I now understand even more clearly why the state turns over all its evidence to the defense. The state has the upper hand in gathering evidence and compelling interrogations and confessions. It is the defense's job to poke holes in that.

anonymous	2	0	I think that this is really important to keep in mind - the detectives, police, and prosecutor who accused and tried Adnan weren't looking for the truth, they were looking to convict someone. That doesn't mean that Adnan is innocent (at this point, I have absolutely no idea whether or not he did it). But people who say that he must be guilty because the court found him guilty are misunderstanding how that process works. It's so obvious at this point that there are *so* many holes in Jay's testimony and timelines. Did Adnan do it? I have no idea. Was there enough evidence to send him to jail for life? Absolutely not.	20141128T235643
reddit1070	3	0	This one is also relevant -- here Jay is being used as an Octopus' ink bag: Octopus Analogy - This is one that, as Bugliosi writes “would have been ideal for the Simpson jury at the beginning of closing argument. . .” “I wonder if any of you folks have read Victor Hugo’s account of the octopus. He tells us of how it doesn’t have any beak to defend itself like a bird, no claws like a lion, nor teeth like an alligator. But it does have what could be called an ink bag, and to protect itself when it is attacked it lets out a dark fluid from this bag, thus making all of the surrounding water dark and murky, enabling the octopus to escape into the darkness. “Now I ask you folks, is there any similarity between that description of the ink bag of the octopus and the defense in this case? Has the defense shown you any real, valid, legitimate defense reasonably based on the evidence, or has it sought to employ the ink bag of the octopus, and by making everything dark around Mr. Simpson, tried to let him escape into the darkness. “I intend to clear up the water which defense counsel have sought to muddy, so that you folks can clearly see the evidence, the facts, the issues in this case, so that you can behold the form of the retreating octopus and bring this defendant back to face justice.” Now, that’s a compelling analogy that can be modified slightly to fit a situation where the other side has set out to confuse and confound.	20141128T195651
reddit1070	3	0	Here is an excerpt from Vince Bugliosi, famed prosecutor. He won nearly all of the ~100 cases he tried. Rope Analogy – This is an argument that Bugliosi writes that he gave in a double-murder case and that the prosecutors could have used in the Simpson case: “I think that counsels’ problem is that they misconceive what circumstantial evidence is all about. Circumstantial evidence is not, as they claim, like a chain. You could have a chain spanning the Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia to Bordeaux, France, consisting of millions of links, and with one weak link that chain is broken. “Circumstantial evidence to the contrary, is like a rope. And each fact is a strand of that rope. And as the prosecution piles one fact upon another we add strands and we add strength to that rope. If one strand breaks – and I’m not conceding for one moment that any strand has broken in this case – but if one strand does break, the rope is not broken. The strength of the rope is barely diminished. Why? Because there are so many other strands of almost steel-like strength that the rope is still more than strong enough to bind these two defendants to justice. That’s what circumstantial evidence is all about.” Source: http://advocacytraining.blogspot.com/2011/10/winning-closing-argument.html	20141128T195351
sjeannep	2	0	I agree that there is no evidence whether he committed this murder or not that he was on his way to being a serial murderer. However, he also hasn't been in any situation that is like the one in which he may or may not have committed murder.

I heard about some statistics person recently saying that since we mess this justice thing up fairly consistently anyway, he could probably concoct some evolving algorithm to judge and sentence people via probability and achieve largely the same results on the whole, maybe even better.

Who in the world would take this case - except someone who wanted a client that would surely be convicted, but whose family maintained their innocence and would surely want to appeal? I'm sure there is a chance Zach truly is innocent, but how in the world would anyone prove it? They don't have much to go on here. A flimsy weapon, and a sighting of an unfamiliar van in the neighborhood, while a similar van in the neighborhood that day (which could have been mistaken for The Unfamiliar Van) was accounted for. Any alternate story (which could be true) is going to sound preposterous, unless someone presents new information.	20141225T024743

anonymous	2	0	This is bad for Jay, because the prosecutors need a call they can reasonably assume is Adnan calling for Jay to pick him up. I don't think there are any calls at 3:40 that fit the bill.	20141128T192018
anonymous	1	0	It's my understanding that the state's case is that Hae was killed between 2:15 and 2:36, the 21-minute period. The state's case then should rise and fall based on this timeline. At the moment, I'm not speculating on Adnan's guilt or innocence…but the timeline that Hae had to be killed between 2:15 and 2:36 leaves no margin for error. If Hae was strangled to death, such a method of killing is not quick & easy from everything I have ever read or seen about murder. It takes time. Then, I'd have to imagine a person has to work up to the state to where they can carry out such an act. Surely, too, that takes at least a few minutes. It seems like to me that the state's timeline seems very inconceivable. I can only imagine, though, that the jury would have had similar thoughts. Yet, they still came to a guilty verdict. So, there is that (which is why I'm still on the fence to Adnan's guilt or innocence).	20141128T202114
platorithm	1	0	> It means (1) Jay admits he had the phone when the Nisha call happened Jay has always admitted he was with Adnan and the phone during the Nisha call. Here's what he says about it in the second interview: Jay: Yeah um, Adnan, I can't remember whether he received a call or placed a call, but I do remember he was talking to a girl um, I can't remember her name. He put me on the phone with her for like 3 minutes. I said hello to her. MacGillivary: Where did she ah, live? Jay: REDACTED (but we know he says Silver Springs, I believe) MacGillivary: Do you recall her name? Jay: No I don't.	20141128T203037
Hopper80	1	0	As far as I can tell, the cops never tried to get hold of the phone records of people who had Adnan's mobile number, so they could see who was calling it when. It really bugs me - so much of that day rvolved around phone calls. Same with asking for Jenn's phone records. Ditto the phone records for the payphone at Best Buy. You're not going to confirm Adnan called his mobile from there, but you'd confirm someone did or no-one did, both of which would be helpful, as would establishing that the payphone actually existed. Did the cops leave their cynicism at home, and just rely on Jay to 'fess up every lie he told them? He admits to lying, which apparently makes him honest and reliable. There are far too few facts in this case, and too many stories, too many versions of what *honestly promisedly to the best of my ability* happened. I understand there'll be legal difficulties in getting hold of non-suspect phone records, but did they at least ask? Even if there weren't lying involved, testimony drawn from memory can be slippy. I would want as firm a picture of what was going on that day as possible.	20141128T214718
pghinred	1	0	I was thinking the same thing.... One thing Jay is consistent about is that he was at Jenn's house until 3:30 - 3:45pm, when he received a call from Adnan - which Jay testifies is the Come Get Me call (First come get me at Edmonson strip, then best buy, but that's not this post's point). I agree that there is a big discrepancy between the Prosecution's supposed 2:36pm Come Get Me call and the 3:40pm timeline Jay is sticking to throughout each interview..... 3 incoming calls at 12:43pm, 2:36pm and 3:15pm. Then, no incoming calls until 4:27pm, 4:58pm, and 5:14pm. This is more in line with Adnan's timeline than Jay's. Additionally, it supports and clarifies that Jay received 3 calls at Jenn's home - the final one to Jenn's landline; and would indicate that Jay had the phone during the Nisha 3:21pm call - smoking gun - potential butt dial. This is also more consistent with various friends spotting Hae still at school around 2:30- 3pm - most notable, her Wrestling Manager buddy, who she was supposed to mentor at the wrestling meet/match at a nearby school. Why doesn't SK explore/discuss this further? First timer here. Interested in plausible holes in this theory, thoughts....etc.	20141223T214525
k9copz	2	0	"I agree. The only incoming calls around the 3:40 time are at 3:15 and 4:27. Note that in Jay's second interview timeline, it says he says he received *three* calls while at Jenn's, including one to her landline. I know if no explanation why Adnan would have called her landline, but it's *possible* that Adnan made the ""come get me call"" to Jenn's landline and not his cell phone. The 3:15 call is a plausible candidate, though it's obviously too early to work exactly with Jay's timeline. Interestingly, in Adnan's timeline, he says Jay picked him up at ~4:30-5:00. Adnan could have called Jay around at 4:27 letting him know he was done with practice. I'm aware of no evidence on that point, though."	20141128T194439
anonymous	1	0	Is there a possibility Adnan called Jen's landline, or another landline? Why does the come-and-get-me call need to be on the cell records?	20141128T202948
anonymous	3	0	"Yes the state's timeline is not believable. It is extremely, I mean extremely, unlikely that Hae was dead by 2:36. But the question is: what did happen? The answer is certainly not: ""whatever the opposition to the prosecution said happened"""	20141129T005424
k9copz	2	0	"I agree that is the state's case. But at this point, it seems there's nothing to support it, including the state's key witness (Jay). So I'm more interested in what actually happened, or at least what could have happened, than in what the state said happened. That's why I raise this point. Sure, the ""come get me"" call didn't happen at 2:36, and witnesses saw Hae and/or Adnan after that time, so it's very unlikely the murder happened at or before 2:36. In that case, how can we piece together the calls, testimony, etc, in order to figure out what happened after that? I'm also less interested in the jury's thinking on the whole thing. A jury can only consider evidence/arguments it is presented with. Unlike us, they didn't hear all the hearsay, excluded evidence, and evidence that came out after the trial. I think the podcast audience now knows significantly more than the jury ever knew."	20141128T211631
gaussprime	1	0	Adnan was on trial for murder. He was not on trial for murder at 2:36pm. There is no reason the entire case needs to fall if that falls.	20141129T061022
k9copz	1	0	That's a good point. I forgot Jay said that about the call with Nisha (or at least the girl from Silver Springs). I guess the main point is: *By Jay's own admission* (and supported by Jenn's statement that he left her house between 3:30 and 3:45), he was alone with the phone at 3:32 pm, when the call to Nisha happened. In other words, even Jay admits he had Adnan's phone and he wasn't with Adnan when the 3:32 Nisha call happened. His statement at his second interview that you quote above presents yet another contradiction in his testimony/interview statements. Very interesting.	20141128T213649

readybrek	1	0	> So I'm more interested in what actually happened, We'll never know because not enough factual evidence was collected by the cops. The cops could have investigated Adnan's library alibi - he said he might be there - was he? There's a good chance there was a system for using the computers - is there evidence he used one? What about his emails - is there datestamps for when he read his email or sent any? The cops could have interviewed Jay a lot better and treated him more as a suspect. He's almost certainly involved so why not search his home? why not interview the people he spoke to on Adnan's mobile? the people like Chris that he says he spoke to about the murder? Same with Jenn, why not look at her phone records and her pager records. The cops might have been able to clear up the Nisha call - they could have asked her family who was at home at that time and if they remembered an unusual call in the afternoon. They could have asked in school and at the mosque if anyone specifically remembers Hae or Adnan being present. There is not enough data to figure out anything of any consequence. If you believe Adnan or Jay is guilty then you are using your gut feeling and making the evidence fit. The less evidence you use and the more interpretation (Adnan confessed to his lawyer and so she deliberately threw the case, Jay is lying to cover up some big drug deal that went wrong) the stronger your gut feeling and the more desperate you are to prove your pet theory. If you think Adnan is guilty then all the evidence as interpreted by you points that way. If you think he is innocent then all the evidence as interpreted by you points that way or at least has some plausible counter argument that exonerates him. The only thing we can make any kind of judgement on is whether the State's case was good enough to convict Adnan beyond reasonable doubt - because that's pretty much all that was investigated by the cops.	20141129T190632
readybrek	1	0	Surely the State has to put up a plausible explanation of when Hae was murdered? They didn't or couldn't. If the 2.36pm call was garbage then when was Hae murdered? If the murder didn't happen as the State claims then how can you not say there is reasonable doubt? As to the actual murder, we've only got the kind of speculation that we're doing now - we have some facts, can we fit Adnan, Jenn or Jay or Suspect X into those facts? That's not building a case, that's using known facts to make the story you want to hear.	20141129T115630
anonymous	1	0	The most obvious explanation for Jay and Jenn to both be saying that they were together up until 3:30 is that they both know this is when the murder actually took place. Between 3 and 3:30 is the time for which Jay must have an alibi. Jenn is it. The problem they have is that Adnan's phone is calling her house at 3:21, and Adnan's phone is calling Nisha at 3:32 . . . so whatever story they're telling about where they were can't be true.	20141128T215305
Hopper80	1	0	There's too little data here, and it seems to me - naieve and ignorant as I am - that there could have been more effort to get a bit more data. Adnan doesn't remember much of anything. Jay has an excess of memory, walking back and forth all over his story, such that it would be impossible for everything he said to be true. Would that there were a bit more certainty of what happened that day, a bit more scepticism and fact checking (or even attempts at such) when going through statements.	20141128T231325
k9copz	0	0	That to me shows that Jay's testimony is inconsistent. It can't be true that both (1) the 3:15 call was the come and get me call and (2) the 3:21 call to Jenn was about checking if Patrick was available. There are all sorts of inconsistencies (on all sides, for all witnesses) between the call log, the testimony, and the cell tower records. The testimony could always be wrong. The call log (let's assume) is bulletproof. So, forgetting about the testimony for a second, I'm just saying that the 3:15 could still be the come and get me call, and the 3:21 call to Jenn could be for almost anything (just not asking about Patrick's location after leaving the Park and Ride).	20141128T221303
Pamelina77	1	0	Why would Adnan need to be picked up at Best Buy if he was there with Hae's vehicle?	20141203T034307
gaussprime	2	0	"I mostly just disagree with your definition of reasonable doubt. I don't think there's a reasonable chance anyone other than Adnan's killed Hae. I do think there's a reasonable chance he didn't do it at Best Buy or at 2:36. Neither the time nor the place is one of the elements of the crime. The prosecution's job is to prove the elements of the crime- they don't need to give ""the correct"" narrative."	20141129T152037
k9copz	2	0	Well, it *could* be true. If the Nisha 3:32 call is a butt dial, why couldn't the Jenn 3:21 call also be a butt dial while they're sitting on the couch together at her house? I'm taking the position that all bets are off on testimony about the individual calls, and I'm trying to figure out what is *humanly* possible based on the times/people/cell tower locations.	20141128T221741
anonymous	3	0	"The argument is made that the testimonies are incredulous, but the very people who argue that the testimonies are incredulous then use these very testimonies as proof of various points they put forward. I have read Dana's piece on Serial and there is simply no way you can conclude from the information given that the 3:15 call was not a ""come and get me"" call (UNLESS you take certain DETAILS and SEGMENTS of Jay's testimonies as fact - which I certainly don't - does anyone?)"	20141129T005111
readybrek	0	0	So he didn't do the crime as put forward by the State, as investigated by the police but there can still be a good chance that he did it some other way not mentioned by the State and not investigated by the cops? Or mentioned by anyone in fact. Maybe hinted at by Jay with his 3.45pm testimony? And a jury can convict on that? You don't find that a bit scary? I don't like the colour of your eyes so even though the state hasn't proved the case against you - my gut feeling is guilty so that's how I'll vote? A jury is not supposed to convict based on who the likeliest guy in this room killed the victim - they are supposed to convict using the test of beyond reasonable doubt. The State in this case can't even put up a convincing case as to when Hae was murdered. The narrative was plain wrong. And of course Adnan is the likeliest looking guy - he's the only one apart from Mr S that the cop actually investigated. BTW there is almost no chance Hae was murdered pre 2.36pm - the cops themselves say that Hae was last seen about 3pm when they first ask if anyone has any info about Hae's disappearance. This is then corroborated by Hae's wrestling friend to SK.	20141129T185042
anonymous	2	0	> why couldn't the Jenn 3:21 call also be a butt dial while they're sitting on the couch together at her house? Because the way you get a butt dial is to have the number programmed into the phone. Nisha's number was programmed into Adnan's phone. Jenn's home phone wasn't.	20141128T221908
k9copz	1	0	"I agree, and I don't take any of Jay's statements as fact. His various statements are internally inconsistent, at the very least. You say: >there is simply no way you can conclude from the information given that the 3:15 call was not a ""come and get me"" call Don't you have an extra ""not"" in there? Don't you mean there's no way you can conclude the 3:15 call *was* the ""come and get me"" call? See below on this, but if anyone wants to argue that the 3:15 call was the ""come and get me"" call, they would have to explain why it wasn't received at Jenn's house, where Jay claims (and Jenn backs up) he was at 3:15."	20141129T010503
gaussprime	1	0	"No I don't find it scary that a jury can convict when they conclude someone is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, even if it's not by the exact narrative put forth by the police. I never said ""likeliest"" guy in the room. I think he's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and I tend to doubt that he did it at 2:36 at Best Buy. It's not a 51% thing however. It's the lack of plausible alternatives. Somebody killed Hae, and nobody but Adnan could have reasonably done it."	20141129T185709
k9copz	1	0	That's one way to get a butt dial. Probably not the only way. Jenn's number was also the most recent outgoing call. Maybe it's easy to butt navigate to the most recent call and butt dial from there. Maybe he meant to call somebody else at 3:21 from her house, and called Jenn instead by accident. There are many possible explanations. I agree your theory is the most likely, I just don't think the timing means any story they tell *can't* be true.	20141128T222629
anonymous	1	0	No, it is supposed to be a double negative. I am contradicting Dana's analysis, which is based on Jay's testimony. I just saw the stuff below so I carried on with this down there.	20141129T022351
readybrek	0	0	How could Adnan reasonably have done it when Hae's death is never explained in any plausible manner? A person is supposed to go into a court room with the presumption of innocence. The jury is supposed to listen to the evidence and decide whether beyond all reasonable doubt, they have been convinced that the accused did the crime, not 51%/49% towards guilty - beyond ALL reasonable doubt. If there are reasonable doubts about a crime and in this one there are many, Jay's testimony changed many times, the cops showed evidence to Jay and it helped him remember things better, Jay, Jenn's and Cathy's testimony at trial does not add up, the murder timeline does not add up - then you should dismiss the charges even if you feel sure that he did it because some things make you think he might be guilty in a different way the State claims eg he sounds like a sociopath therefore I think he might be guilty. How on earth can you be convinced if the State hasn't put forward a plausible explanation regarding how the crime was committed? Lack of plausible alternatives is bound to happen if you are the only person that has been fully investigated and no one has bothered investigating anything that could exonerate you.	20141129T210426
anonymous	2	0	> I just don't think the timing means any story they tell can't be true. No, I don't think that either. What's important is that both of them are saying they were alone together at Jenn's house from 1:30 up until 3:45, which means that neither of them could have been present when someone killed Hae Lee. The phone evidence makes it awfully hard to buy this; it doesn't give them an alibi for the most likely time of her death. You need to believe that first the phone accidentally calls the most recently called number (was this really a thing?) and then ten minutes later that it accidentally calls the first number in the memory list. I suppose it's within the realm of possibility . . . maybe. But probably not. And once you take away the certainty that Jay was with Jenn at about 3 pm, you have to ask where he actually was instead, and why they're both lying about it.	20141128T224332
k9copz	1	0	I see what you mean. I agree that you can't conclude that Dana's analysis, which is at http://serialpodcast.org/posts/2014/10/why-it-cant-be-the-315-call, proves that the 3:15 call wasn't the come and get me call.	20141129T050445
gaussprime	1	0	"The police did investigate three other alternatives and found them lacking. The police settled on Adnan precisely because the other alternatives were implausible. Plus, you know, there was a defense team... There are many plausible scenarios for how Adnan killed Hae. My personal belief is that the library theory is most likely. But Best Buy or other locations are also possible. I have yet to see a plausible scenario for another killer. Presented with several plausible ""Adnan did it"" scenarios and zero ""anyone else did it"" scenarios, that's beyond a reasonable doubt."	20141129T234835
k9copz	1	0	I think we're in agreement on all these points. My only issue was when you said: >so whatever story they're telling about where they were can't be true.

Em_malik	1	0	I just checked the cell towers, between 2:36-4pm the same cell tower pinged for all the calls in that time period, which were in the Woodlawn-Bestbuy area. He couldn't have been at Jenn's house. so whoever had the phone at that time was in that same area the whole time.	20141129T002831
FeelinGarfunkelly	1	0	1. Adnan's phone could potentially butt dial the most recently called number, [according to page 41 of the phone manual](http://nds2.nokia.com/files/support/nam/phones/guides/6160_US_en.PDF). 2. If Nisha is indeed the first person stored on speed dial, in position 2 (1 would be voice mail) it's still possible for a butt dial (and all the speculation of a 2:22-long butt dial) 3. Did any detectives ever talk to Jenn's little brother with whom Jay was supposedly playing video games who could either confirm or deny their being at the house?	20141129T023917

But do you agree, at least, that the police didn't work very hard to look into evidence that may have exonerated Adnan? The Library alibi, asking where Adnan kept his phone while he was at mosque, checking out the Nisha call with her and her family, asking his friends and family if he ever owned a pair of red gloves, asking the teacher if she remembered what time Adnan picked up his certificate (he was supposed to be on his way there at 3pm), asking for alibi witnesses at school and mosque at the crucial times when they thought Hae was being buried and Adnan has a vague alibi. That's not to say that this evidence wouldn't have made the case against him more watertight but these things also could have exonerated him and the police didn't bother investigating them. Edited to clarify - *I could show you some definitions from legal websites (there is no actual legal definition of beyond all reasonable doubt)	20141130T100347

k9copz	1	0	Nice! So Jay admits he had the phone without Adnan until at least 3:40. He claims (and Jenn supports the claim) that they were at his house until then. But the cell tower records indicate the phone was not at Jenn's house. To me, this is the single most important piece of evidence. If this had been presented to a jury properly, how could this not raise all sorts of questions about Adnan's guilt, given that it negates Jay's alibi, shows his timeline was impossible, etc?	20141129T004000
anonymous	0	0	Of course he wasn't at Jenn's house because he was ringing Jenn's house. Jay was out and about by 3:21. Jenn and Jay cannot have all these times in any way accurate weeks after the event. In the first interviews they are guessing/estimating the times. In the early interviews, Jay certainly knows when Hae has been killed (let's not speculate how). So he tries to say he was at Jen's until quite late. But the cops start giving him information and push him in certain directions. OK, he realises that it is not so fatal after all for him to say he was out and about just after 2:36. But of course he wasn't out and about by 2:36. 1. He leaves his house shortly after 3:15 2. He picks up Adnan and Adnan rings Nisha at 3:32	20141129T011249
k9copz	1	0	Nice confirmation on the recently-called butt dial point. I think the key piece of information showing that Jay wasn't at Jenn's house is the fact that the cell tower data for the 3:15 and 3:32 calls doesn't match the location of Jenn's house. Jay must have left her house earlier, or else he was never there.	20141129T050953

They can only work with what they have and can't dedicate all of their budget to any one particular case. Wires cost money. They take time. You need a court order. It's simply not worth it on a case like this. So like any job you move forward with the imperfect situation you have and hope you do your best. Everyone asking ""why didn't they do this or that"" needs to realize that we, here, have unlimited time to dissect this case, and unless you donated to the podcast, it's essentially free. The police don't have that same freedom. It's not like in fiction where there's some cop who's so dedicated to *the job* that he does whatever he can to get it done. They face all the same financial and bureaucratic nonsense we all do. They can only do so much within their means. Plus, this is the one murder case were focusing on because there's a podcast about it. In reality there are hundreds of murders in and around Baltimore every year. There's nothing unique about Adnan's case other than the media attention fifteen years after the fact. So I hope this doesn't sound rude, but yes, you may be watching too many detective movies. ;-) We have no idea what it's like to be a detective."	20141128T214125
Kicking-it-per-se	4	0	They arrested him quite quickly after interviewing Jay didn't they? What was the gap between his 1st interview & Adnan's arrest? Maybe they thought they had enough for evidence?	20141128T192842
amalechimp	3	0	Well, they didn't need it to get a conviction, did they?	20141128T214401
The_Stockholm_Rhino	7	0	Thought of the same thing when I started reading! They could even have Jay call Adnan from the Police Station and tape that call (with no caller ID of course)... But as others have pointed out it seems that they quickly went from investigating the crime from all angles to securing a conviction of Adnan.	20141128T214603
Hopper80	8	0	God, yes. I'm annoyed at the speed they seemed to go from investigating a crime to securing a conviction (quite different things, much as I may hope they shouldn't be), but this would actually help the former and the latter. I wish they'd straight up asked to see people's phone records, particularly those who had Adnan's brand new mobile no. There's a lot of phoning back and forth going on in the stories, and it would be helpful to be able to pin those moments of contact down to their actual occurences.	20141128T201828

whitenoise2323	5	0	Maybe they were worried about contradicting their already very tidy story. Getting a wire is a hassle, takes time. You have to get a warrant, there is now a paper trail. You don't necessarily have control over the information that comes from the wiretap, as you would an interview.	20141128T193947
ViciousLidocaine	3	0	"I could be wrong myself, but I think many people in this thread are confusing a ""wire"" (a small microphone and recording device) with a wiretap. I'm not familiar with local laws, but I doubt attaching a recording device to Jay would require a warrant. Wikipedia says that Maryland is a state that requires all parties to consent to recording telephone calls, but that restriction seems to be specific to phone calls. As for why they wouldn't do it, I agree with the assessment that they might have been more likely to record Adnan saying something that would hurt their case than to help them."	20141129T031700

HazMat68W	3	0	> you may be watching too many detective movies. While you make valid points, this point is not all that valid. These are concerns that need to be voiced as people's lives are on the line. When you are facing life in prison, you dont want corners to be cut, simply b/c you're going into overtime. Yeah, that's the reality of it, but that is still unacceptable. But if people just accept it and move on, no improvement will be made and innocent people will be locked up, and guilty people will walk free. And if that's the case, what is the point of law and law enforcement?	20141208T155345
goliath_franco	5	0	It was the same day. Jay basically spills to police (his first interview) in the late evening/early morning of Feb 27/28.

What if Adnan unknowingly poked some hole in their wholly concocted story that their version couldn't recover from? It would have been stupid for them to wire Jay because they might get a result that would hinder their prosecution. They just needed to convict someone and Adnan was the easiest if Jay played his part.	20141128T205359

egonsmom	6	0	I just read that in jenn's interview she told the police Jay was wearing a red flannel shirt. Maybe he made up that Adnan wore red gloves in case they found his flannel fibers on Hae. Kind of a moot point, since the fibers found were orange and blue... but flannel shirts are usually multiple colors so maybe the orange and blue fibers were from Jay's shirt.	20141128T224556

joppy77	1	0	I've considered this possibility in the past.

dlewu22	3	0	Perhaps, maybe if someone identified Jay based on what he was wearing in the dark, and he was wearing a hoodie or something like that, maybe the gloves would be something that stood out. I do think SK mentions this a few times for a reason. Like the rope.	20141129T000150

amalechimp	6	0	>I believe the coincidence at the heart of the Adnan Syed case that makes it a story is Hae Min Lee encountered someone, somewhere on Jan 13 1999 who was connected in some way to a kid who coincidentally was driving her ex-boyfriend's car and using his phone. So in this scenario why does Jay end up saying Adnan did it? But it's true that we can't rule out huge coindicences just because they seem very unlikely. They have to happen to someone.	20141128T204722

ChariBari	2	0	Regardless of who killed Hae, there are multiple meaningless coincidences in this story. We just don't know which ones are imperative to the murder. For example if Roy Davis were the killer, then it was only a coincidence that Hae had just broken up with Adnan. If Adnan is the killer, then it was a only a coincidence that Hae was driving past a known killer's house every time she picked up her cousin. Other scenarios rely on other coincidences. It's hard to know which ones are important.	20141129T024801

mke_504	6	0	I think this is just a normal question trying to establish how Jen knows that the day she is talking about is January 13th, and not another day entirely. They are just trying to glean a concrete fact from Jen that would identify the date (someone's birthday, etc.). Because honestly, I don't know about other people, but I don't remember days based on their dates. I remember things based on what happened, and the days of the week; then I would have to go back and look at a calendar to determine the date.	20141128T203603
whitenoise2323	7	0	I was struck by this moment too. It feels a bit candid on the cops part when compared to what many have speculated about their leading interviews. Also, it's super weird that Jenn doesn't have the self awareness to realize how weird it sounds to say she remembers it's the 13th because the cops told her and not because that was the day she helped her friend destroy evidence of a murder.	20141128T200444
dmbroad	2	0	"This is a good one, too: In speaking to police, Jenn says, “Jay told me like last night that it was Adnan’s car that he was in.” She is referring to the night before her *police interview* at the end of February-- *after* Hae’s body has been found. When Jay is obviously prepping her for her police interview. Think about it. She's informs police she saw Adnan, in his car, on Jan. 13th when she picked Jay up from F&M, Value City, Westview, Super Fresh...pick one, she mentions them all to police.... But in the same interview, she's saying to police she only found out ""that"" was Adnan's car on the night of February 25th or something. Jenn *never* saw Adnan that night. She picked Jay up alone on Edmondson Ave. by some mall after he buried Hae and left her car on Edmondson Ave. (cell tower pings 8:04 and 8:05."") (Same with taking him to where he left Adnan's car after driving Hae's to Park-and-Go). Elsewhere in the police interview, Jen tells police that she learned Hae was missing on the *TV News* while they were in Champs (including Jay). Until police correct her. And remember her parting words to Sarah Koenig were, ""I never believed it was at Best Buy."" Jenn actually knows **nothing** except what Jay instructed her to say the night before her police interview. Anyone who bases any theory on a word Jenn said is barking up the wrong tree. And this is definitely why Jenn also says ""Adnan answered the phone,"" while Jay was in Leakin Park. Jay must have instructed her to place Adnan at the burial site. Well at least we know who the 7:09 and 7:16 incoming calls are from. And that Jay buried Hae all by his lonesome. In fact, I think based on her police statement: *Jay tells Jenn nothing about anything on the day of Hae's murder. Highly possible that not until Police visit her -- and then the night before her police interview, when Jay preps her -- does Jenn ever learn that Jay is even ""involved.""* All Jenn thought was Jay needed some rides that day, as usual, because he does not have a car so must have always been bumming rides. But agrees with Kathy that he's acting weird. To understand Jenn's fierce devotion to Jay, read between the lines of her statement to police when they ask if she and Jay are ""boyfriend, girlfriend type?"""	20141202T204822
dmbroad	2	0	"If we could regain our virgin minds and go back to the beginning... So your the police. The dead body of a missing Woodlawn student has been found. You rightfully want to look at the ex-boyfriend as a person of interest. So you pull his cellphone records. And the overwhelming amount of calls are to one person, Jenn. From 12:07 to 8:05. And for all you know, there are as many incoming calls from her. So you call in this Jenn...and *she's not even friends with the ex-boyfriend.* For a cop with any instincts, wouldn't alarm bells go off at that moment? Because when you talk to this Jenn, she is stuttering and contradicting herself in the interview. And giving wild, scatter-shot time frames like ""3:30, 4:00, 4:15. Well after 3:45. Between 3:45 and 4:15."" And saying she picked up what turns out to be *her* friend, Jay, at 8:00 from Westview, Super Fresh, Value City, F&M. Tell me there are homicide detectives out there who are smarter and have better instincts than Ritz, McGillivary and Lehmann. Who would have immediately smelled something fishy going on. Something was ""off"" as Jim Trainum says. Instead, Lehmann only gently reminds Jenn of her inconsistencies, what she just said a few minutes ago. Lean on her, man! Be a suspicious cop. Charge her as an accessory for helping to destroy evidence in a capital murder case (Jay's clothes, boots, the shovel *singular*) -- and see how fast she stops stuttering and contradicting herself.

TrillianSwan	3	0	That's reasonable, although in other places in her statement she doesn't seem to have any idea of what the day of the week it was (the cops have to tell her), but she's sure about the dates 13th and 14th. ETA: Oops, yeah, it was directly before that, she's lost on the day of the week (trying to account for her schedule) and the cops tell her it was a Wednesday, and that's when Lehmann jumps in and asks how she knows it was the 13th.

He chimes in a bit here and there after that, I don't really see a pattern to it, it almost seems like he's coming into it to give the other guys a break, like a tag team.

TrillianSwan	1	0	"Yes, my best guess for all her inconsistencies (and I'm working on a timeline, but geez it's tough) is that she never knew anything until the night before her recorded interrogation. There's also a bit of it in which she tries to reconcile doing all this and not telling anyone about Hae while being a ""law-abiding citizen"".

dmbroad	2	0	"Did you see the November 29 post from the renowned Susan Simpson? ""Plotting the Coordinates of Jay's Dreams"". As she says, Jenn and Jay's police statements are a Train Wreck. But it is also really funny in a macabre way. But depressing, too, for Adnan. Because cops just roll with the train wreck of Jay's story instead of realizing the obvious: Jay is making everything up on the fly. Cars appearing and disappearing, etc. http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/29/serial-plotting-the-coordinates-of-jays-dreams/"	20141203T204525
dev1anter	10	0	In many other moments too, be it jay or jenn. Susan (that link that everybody posts) wrote an interesting thing I agree with you re: the apparent laziness of the investigation. I haven’t seen anything that makes me think either the investigators or the prosecutors acted in a deliberately improper way in pursuing the case against Adnan. What happened here seems to have been more insidious: everyone thought they were acted reasonably, only what appeared to be good info, but once it was decided that Adnan was their perp, all subsequent evidence was shoehorned into fitting that theory. One of Adnan’s really bad strokes of bad luck was the timing of how the evidence against him came out. I can see how, when it was all happening, it would have seemed to the investigators like everything was falling into place. They start with the assumption that Hae was probably killed by a former or current intimate partner (because who else would have motive to commit that kind of murder?) — and Adnan goes on their list, along with everyone else who meets that description. They then rule out anyone on that list with an alibi — but they can’t rule out Adnan, because his alibi is that he was just hanging out at school, and it’s unclear if anyone saw him at the specific time of her death. The cops are primed to be receptive to any evidence pointing his way. And then suddenly they have an anonymous caller, with facially credible info, telling them to take a closer look at Adnan — and Adnan rockets to the top of their suspect list. Alarm bells are ringing. Red flags are waving. Spidey senses are tingling. With bated breath, they pull Adnan’s cell phone records — *bam!* Look at that! Two hits for Leakin Park on the night of Hae’s disappearance. Beautiful evidence, they couldn’t have hoped for more. Now convinced they are about to close in on their prey, they bring in Jenn, whom the phone calls that night were to — and everything slides perfectly into place, like clockwork, as she tells them about Adnan’s statements to Jay, and the 8 p.m. pickup, which matches so perfectly with the Leakin Park calls at 7 p.m. *Hot damn, they’ve got their man!* So they bring in Jay, because they’re going to need his testimony to get Adnan locked up — Jenn’s hearsay won’t do it. And at first, Jay doesn’t say what they want him to, does’t tell them what “the truth” is, because the investigators know what the truth is now. But after a little cajoling, Jay come through, tells them exactly what the investigators “know” the case to be. And it all made sense, at the time. It was just so neat and satisfying — a perfect synergy between their theory about a scorned ex-boyfriend, and the evidence from the ex-boyfriend’s cell phone showing that the phone was with the body when it was buried. It was such a perfect case that no one stopped to ask the obvious question: was there anyone else, other than Adnan, who was a nexus between Jenn’s story and the cell phone data? For example, someone who may have told Jenn everything she knew about Adnan, and someone who we know borrowed Adnan’s phone that day?	20141128T202026
TrillianSwan	1	0	I did, a classic! I also read your timeline, nicely done!	20141203T212257
TrillianSwan	7	0	"Very well said!!! :) ETA: This is the kind of ""corruption"" I think we're seeing in this case, not the ""I'm a bad cop"" kind, but the ""I'm a GREAT cop!"" kind, getting their man, sliding past obvious questions, etc. You nailed it."	20141128T202435
bitofastate	1	0	But Jay would have been much harder to build a case on, no real forensics, no motive and if you go with his and Jen's timeline, no opportunity, they were together until 3:45, although the phone contradicts that. Adnan they could build a case on, motive, opportunity as he had no alibi, and then force the very flimsy phone evidence and palm print to give an illusion of forensics cover. Thin, sure, but with the right prosecutor, a well coached star witness and a sprinkling of racial stereotyping. The cops and prosecutors are their to find a perp, and who would ever admit that they go after innocents and still be able to sleep easy at night? Hence their brush off to SK, done and dusted.	20141128T225330

Not Jay's house. They could have leaned on Jenn, instead of accepting her ""inconsistencies,"" having to continually remind her what she just said a while earlier. (Couldn't remember everything Jay told her the night before if you read her statement.) The phone evidence clearly points to a timeline in which Jay could have acted alone, with the help of getting a few rides, as he must have been bumming all the time since he's a drug dealer without a car. How does anyone explain the overwhelming amount of calls to and from Jenn that day -- on Adnan's phone? Jay needed rides back to where he left Adnan's car after he drove Hae's away to the I70 -- and from Edmondson Ave. (8:04 and 8:05) where he leaves Hae's car the second time. Though Patrick (4:12 Forest Park) may have given Jay a ride to his house to buy drugs then back to Jay's own house to get the shovel (4:27 ping at Jay's house.) http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2nhndd/serial_podcast_cell_data_timeline_in_relation_to/"	20141202T231129

etcetera999	4	0	The most striking thing about Jenn's testimony is that police didn't just manufacture a story to frame Adnan because they were desperate to find a suspect. They had Mr S. It's pretty clear that the police didn't coach Jenn into making up a story. Maybe Jay coached Jenn, but the police didn't. Especially with Jenn's lawyer and mother there. Couldn't have happened. The theory that a serial killer did it and then the police just got Jay to make up a story out of thin air is shot.	20141129T023623
8shadesofgray	1	0	I'm surprised that Jenn would know about Mr. S. being a suspect at all; that seems like such a strange detail to be made public in any way ... Particularly because it doesn't seem to me (unless I misunderstood) that they considered him a suspect beyond his polygraph exams. And it seems weird that they'd publicly announce they had a suspect under consideration pre-polygraph. How did Jenn know about this? Am I missing something obvious?	20141128T210325
wtfsherlock	1	0	How did Jenn know about the danger to Hae ahead of time? I didn't see that.	20141129T002905
MusicCompany	10	0	I agree. Many (most?) teenagers would have acted the same way Jenn did. That's why it bothers me that people are incredibly judgmental towards her. On the other hand, I don't want to let her completely off the hook. It would have been good if she and Jay had told someone or done something to prevent this from happening. Though, given that so many people around here still think that Adnan couldn't possibly have done this, it doesn't seem implausible that they might not have actually thought he would go through with it either.	20141128T203034
MusicCompany	9	0	It's in Jay's testimony, actually, version 3 (the third time Jay was questioned). Jay says Adnan told him in advance he was going to kill Hae, and then Jay told Jenn. There are several lines of dialogue regarding this conversation. Page 86 of 106 of the PDF.	20141128T201439

cbr1965	2	0	I think it is more clear now that she says Jay told her about Adnan's plan to murder Hae before it happened, not that he actually did. Jay probably thought it sounded more realistic if he said Adnan planned it.	20141128T232415
MusicCompany	6	0	The explanation is earlier in the same paragraph. Jenn was talking to a friend named Lisa whose husband worked for the police, which is how Jenn found out about this suspect.	20141128T211133
cbr1965	0	0	She says Jay told her that Adnan had threatened to kill Hae before the 13th. Of course, all of it could be untrue because she didn't tell anyone about it until afterward. I tend to believe Jay thought it would make a better case if it was premeditated so his **third** version of events includes that tidbit.	20141129T011541
anonymous	13	0	I am incredibly judgmental toward her. I worked for a long time teaching high school, which is to say, I spent hours and hours with teenagers every day for years and years. It's not normal for them to shrug off the suffering of people close by (Hae Lee's family) when it's within their power to help. That's kind of the exact opposite of what I've seen teenagers do. The exception would be when they have a personal stake (they're the direct cause of the suffering) or when they're just unusually heartless. In Jenn's case, maybe both. Her reaction when SK went to talk with her was a *shrug*. Compare to people like Krista, for whom it still matters that this horrible thing happened.	20141128T212629
Laineybin	7	0	I completely disagree - I believe any 17+ year old knowing about a murdered girl would have handled it differently unless they were involved or covering up for someone who was involved.	20141128T221425
Nutbrowndog	2	0	Yes and this makes the story seem true---Jenn knew and blew it off as Adnan just being a weird dude. So that when it did go down and she realizes she and Jay had foreknowledge they are beholden to each other to at least rewrite the story to minimize both their involvement.	20141129T193905
8shadesofgray	8	0	Thanks! I must have missed that. Seems like a big deal, though ... That Jenn (and presumably Jay, by extension) had at least some access to non-public information prior to interview.	20141129T015013
MusicCompany	9	0	I have personally witnessed teens in peer situations being completely dismissive of intense distress and harm being perpetrated by some kids onto others (especially when those kids are not their friends or are unpopular). Kids/teenagers can be and often are incredibly cruel. They are usually nicer in the presence of a teacher. Sad to say it, but it's true. As a young person being persecuted by my peers and having other kids suggest that I tell a teacher, I can tell you that my response was absolutely not. I knew the teacher would do no good and might even make things worse for me because when the teacher wasn't around, I would get it even worse. Watch the PBS documentary Bully that aired fairly recently for the kinds of things kids do to each other. Hell, teachers sometimes even get in on the act.	20141128T213700

Kids/teenagers can be and often are incredibly cruel. They are usually nicer in the presence of a teacher. Sad to say it, but it's true. Sure, but I think this is not that situation. Kids are cruel to one another when there's a payoff (usually being seen as part of a dominant group, or being a leader in a dominant group). They look away from cruelty in order to protect themselves from becoming a victim. Was Jenn in that kind of position? I don't think so. I think she was worried more than anything that Jay would be going to jail -- when she knew that at the very least he'd helped to bury a girl in the mud in January, and when she could also speculate that he might have taken money to do so. Yeah, I judge her incredibly harshly.	20141128T214428
ShrimpChimp	5	0	I also see that way. I don't see where she every told any more truth than absolutely necessary, she told lie after lie, and it appears she either knew the truth (who killed Hae) or else she decided it was better for her to make sure she didn't find out who killed Hae.	20141128T221332
MusicCompany	3	0	Say what you will about Jenn, but I believe she finally did stand up and tell the truth. You will probably claim her testimony is a lie. But what if it isn't a lie? Take one moment to consider the possibility that she did tell the truth. Consider what would have happened to her if she had gone to the police before school let out on January 13, 1999. It would have taken incredible courage to do that, and she likely would have faced extreme backlash for making accusations about something that she didn't know for sure would happen.	20141128T220219
anonymous	8	0	> You will probably claim her testimony is a lie. Well, I don't think that she and Jay were alone together at her house from 1:30 until 3:45 pm on January 13th. Do you?	20141128T221536

anonymous	10	0	The phone records make it very strange. Adnan's phone called her house at 3:21. Adnan's phone called Nisha at 3:32. If Jay and Jenn were hanging out at her house together (without Adnan), these two phone calls seem very odd. And Jay tells the police and the court that he was with Jenn until at least 3:45 that day. Jenn's powers of recollection seem suspiciously specific to me. It's almost like there was a time window where she absolutely needed to be able to say that Jay was with her. For sure.	20141128T225620
ochre5	3	0	What the phone records show contradicts what jen says. Or the phone record would be lying and jay could be calling jen whilst both are together in Jenn's house just for the fun of it to kill time.	20141129T041627
joeritha	1	0	Impressed with her powers of recollection? An innocent person is more likely to not remember details while a person who is lying would want to remember/say clear statements so they're not caught.

cbr1965	7	0	No, he called her home phone from the cell multiple times during the time they were supposed to be together (and it pinged nowhere near her house). That is what I was saying makes no sense.	20141128T231901

Nutbrowndog	1	0	I'm not sure. Jay also wanted to cover for people like Daniel and Phil (?) whom he may have seen that day. Once he is involved then everyone that saw him or talked to him that day is potentially a witness.	20141129T194110

PowerOfYes	15	0	There is no evidence there was a recorded statement: The conversation on the phone on 13 Jan was not recorded. The only other conversation was at his home, and thus also not recorded. Once he was arrested his lawyer would have advised him not to make a statements to the police, and no one has ever suggested he took part in a recorded interview. It is therefore highly unlikely there are any transcripts.	20141128T215114
ScaryPenguins	12	0	He probably didn't make any statements to the police? Jenn and Jay seemed to have made statements as parts of deals with the prosecution. I do not think there's any reason to think Adnan made a statement to the police-they were charging him with a crime.	20141128T211247
BearInTheWild	10	0	Why do people assume he made statements? Adnan only spoke with the detectives at the station once and he didn't give them anything to make them start recording.	20141128T214234
asha24	11	0	I believe Rabia did release the notes one of the detectives took during the interview at Adnan's house before his arrest. We don't know if any transcripts from Adnan after his arrest even exist, considering SK never references them, I'm inclined to think not. So maybe we should stop criticizing Rabia for not releasing something we are not even sure exists.	20141128T233106

She has promised that she wouldn't 'trump' the Serial team. I'm sure there is a confidentiality agreement. She even had to caution Saad not to say something that would have been a spoiler. If you want to see other documents, you should probably address the Serial oroducers, rather than acting as if Rabia is deliberately trying to hide stuff just to piss you all off.

He dresses, sees his mother is watching, his older brother, his little brother Yusuf is crying. **Then they drive Adnan into the city to an interrogation room in Homicide and hand cuff him to what he describes as a little hook in the wall.** Then follows a long description of his interrogation by the detectives.	20141128T224306

Or to see another friend? Cop: Will you let us know if she contacts you? Her family is very worried. Adnan: Yes. --- So, that's the sort of exchange it would have been. She's been missing for all of 3 hours, and she was 18 years old. If I'm innocent Adnan in that situation, I don't start going over my day. I just saw her in class. After that I waited around until time for track, went to track, broke my fast, smoked a joint, and now I need to get to the mosque or my dad is going to be down on me. I don't go over this information to make sure I have it right, because I don't have the faintest notion that it's going to be important to have it right. If I'm guilty Adnan, otoh, I'm definitely going to nail down those details and know exactly who can vouch for me.	20141128T230651

donailin1	2	0	"i wish i could upvote this a thousand times. it is incredible to me that folks are so desperately trying to see any far fetched thing other than the most obvious thing. Hae blew him off in a very hurtful way, but ever since Adnan's parents humiliated the couple at their homecoming, Hae started to realize what it was really like to have to have a secret relationship, she went back and forth right up until Christmas, even bought Adnan a present (consolation prize?)only to go out with Don on New year's Eve. Most likely, Adnan bought that phone in an effort to get her back, as in ""look, you can call me whenever you want now, freelyand I can call you and my parents will never know."" And the first time he calls her, she is out with Don on a date. *And then he never dials her number again.* Most people find that very telling, as did the jury, and rightly so. Like many people I gave Adnan every benefit of the doubt on the first hearing of all the episodes, but it's just impossible at this point. I've read all of Jay's transcripts and the substance is same. There's a consistent contrition that one cannot fake. And ""I was high, I don't remember, I was smoking weed that day, I can't remember""--nah, that ain't it son. Adnan killed Hae out of pure rejection."	20141128T235158

Adnan doesn't remember it, but it makes sense to me that he got dropped off at the mosque just before 7 pm, and then Jay showed up later and gave him back his phone. Look at who gets called between 5 and 7, and then again after 8 . . .	20141129T004541

anonymous	1	0	What we need is some evidence that he was with his phone, wherever it was, during the most likely time that Hae Lee was being thrown face down into the cold grave that had been dug for her. Adnan says he probably went to the mosque and doesn't think he gave the phone back to Jay, but can't be sure. (Aside -- just consider for a second how easy it would be for him to say he did!) There's a call to Adnan's friend at 6:59, so we can be sure he still had it at that point. And then what? Calls to Jenn's pager at 7, 8:04 and 8:05. There are a pair of incoming calls to the phone at 7:09 and 7:16 that are of unknown origin. By 9 the phone is clearly in Adnan's hands, as all the calls after that point are to his contacts. His father testified that he was at the mosque from 7:30 until 10 . . . having never been inside a mosque or seen how Ramadan prayers work, I have no idea how likely it is that his father could have been specific. At the very least, Adnan wasn't praying between 9 and 10, unless praying includes calling Nisha and Krista a couple of times each. So, what is his alibi at 7 pm? I don't know . . . but if you believe his dad, he was at the mosque by 7:30. And that doesn't leave him enough time to go to Leakin Park, dig a grave, bury a body, get home & cleaned up, and then show up casually to pray.	20141129T022129
newinfonut	1	0	So he was with the phone when the police called, yet we need evidence that he was with it shortly after when the body was likely buried...I believe Jen made arrangements to pick up Jay at the Mall. When they finished burying the body Adman left him with Jen at the mall. They had just dumped Hae's personal stuff in the dumpster...Jen tookJay...Adnan went to prayer as usual..	20141129T023554
newinfonut	1	0	I am not saying specifically that Adnan killed Hae. I don't think there is evidence to prove that BRD presented so far, however,...

newinfonut	1	0	My Perspective: Can you see how Adnan and Jay's stories are so intertwined, along with cell records, as to make Jay's story believable? Yes... Jay's friends were calling Adnan's phone because they believed they could reach him at that number..(he'd been calling them all day from there)..Adnan had to redirect them...Question though....how did the police get Adnan's new cell number to call him at Kathy's?	20141129T030527
anonymous	1	0	"First, Jay's friend Jenn used the phrase ""casual acquaintances"" to describe how Jay and Adnan were, during her taped interview with the cops. So it's not just Adnan who says that Jay ""wasn't really his friend."" Second, there is a witness (Will) who said that Adnan *often* loaned his car to Jay -- so frequently that it wouldn't even have been something anybody noticed. Third, if somebody has your car, and they don't have a phone, it's not completely crazy to let them take the phone. How else are you going to call when you need to get your car back? Fourth, if loaning out your car + phone is a thing you did over the weeks between the 13th of January and the day somebody first asked you about it, it's plausible that you wouldn't be able to say for sure if you did or not. Fifth, he did remember loaning it out the first time. He couldn't be sure for the second. Sixth, let's compare . . . Guy One can't be sure he let Guy Two borrow his car + phone on a particular evening while he went to mosque. Guy Two can't remember if he was sitting on a log having a smoke while a dead body is next to him, or if he was actually up the road waiting while that grave was being dug.

Jay would've had to go in to find him or they would've had a prearranged time and place in the parking lot for the exchange or Adnan would've had to be watching for Jay to show up with the car and cell... but still not recall that sort of arrangement/exchange. Adnan obviously didn't make someone else watch for Jay to arrive that night or I'm sure that would be known by now. And how would've Jay got home from the Mosque? ..AS would've drove him home.. no? ..and still not remember that either!

It's okay if you don't believe me, but I was in fact there. Hardly any teenagers had cell phones. The ones who did wouldn't bother bringing them into school, because the only people they might want to call were already there at school, and most of them did not have phones. There was no texting, no online access, no facebook, no twitter. A phone in your pocket was only useful if you had someone to call. Were you a teenager in 1999? Did you have a phone? Did you bring it to school?	20141219T074614

8shadesofgray	3	0	I started a jacket-related post, too: http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2noki2/lots_of_coats_from_the_data_dump_documents/ In Jay's first interview, it's Hae's blue and red jacket and Adnan takes it but it's unclear what happens after that. In his second interview, it's not assigned to Hae specifically, the colors aren't mentioned and Adnan ultimately throws it deep into the woods. The interviews also bring up both Adnan's and Jay's jackets. Lots of winter clothing in the mix! I personally find the blue/red jacket mention weird, almost as though it's to excuse the found fibers (which admittedly doesn't appear to be public info yet).	20141129T022306
anonymous	1	0	Agreed. If there was a jacket like that, wouldn't they have found it in the surrounding area? Maybe they didn't look enough :/	20141128T233359

LUNABELLA123	2	0	A cigarette could have decayed/broken down under the snow/rain/ice over the 6 weeks between the burial and the discovery of the body. Someone mentioned that Jay could have pocketed the butt--he was super careful not to touch Have, from the sound of his telling of the story, and seemed very conscious that he had to be careful not to leave any fingerprints/fibers/hair or what have you anywhere near Hae's body or car. He worried about the soil from the burial site in Adnan's car. So, pocketing the butt would fall in line with this, it seems.	20141129T010642
LUNABELLA123	3	0	I don't understand the idea that specific details in a story make that story less plausible. I do, however, agree that it would be nuts to throw a jacket belonging to your murder victim into the woods where you buried her. To fabricate a story, and throw in a random detail like this (He sees a red and blue nylon jacket in the path leading to to burial site, which he thinks is Hae's, assuming that Adnan has a jacket on, and Jay has a jacket on, and neither match this description), if anything, smacks of the truth to me.	20141129T014421
LUNABELLA123	2	0	Maybe it's a coincidence. I doubt that the police told Jay about fiber evidence being found on Hae's body. But, we (mostly, I believe) agree that Jay was THERE at the burial sight at the very least, right? Either he killed Hae, or he helped Adnan bury her, correct? So the fact that he saw a jacket that might match those fibers would not be an impossibility.	20141129T170205
LUNABELLA123	3	0	Thanks you're right. I meant to say, it seems like the fibers could have come from the jacket (Hae's, possibly) that Jay mentions in his interview with the police. It is interesting that he mentions this in the interview- he would most likely not know about any red or blue nylon fibers being found on Hae (in forensic report). So, this strikes me as a detail that Jay mentions that seems very authentic. The fact that this jacket was not found and that Jay says in the interview that Adnan threw it deeper into the woods as they returned from burying the body-- could Adnan (or Jay?) have taken it/picked it up when they returned to the visit the burial site--maybe this is why one of them returned to the site--concern about this evidence?	20141129T010222

anonymous	14	0	I'm a lawyer who has worked on the trial and appellate level in both civil and criminal cases. My comment would be that the answer to this depends on a host of variables which I'm unfamiliar with: public pressure to put a potentially dangerous young man (who also happens to be a Muslim) away for a long time, the policies and style of the local DA's office and their staff, etc. Also depends what they thought as far as premeditation- did they really believe he planned this ahead of time? What did they think of his lawyer? What was the sentencing philosophy of the judge who would preside over sentencing? That said, 15 years is pretty short for the high profile strangling of a young woman. In the Southern US state where I live, I routinely see 20 year sentences for drug offenses.	20141128T230152
theroyalalastor	6	0	It's really not a question one can answer...really depends on the strength of the case, the mood of the prosecutor, the community's attitudes at the time, the ability of a defense attorney's ability to negotiate a good plea etc. It's possible.	20141128T225613
BranSerial	3	0	Be wary of anyone who tries to give you a definitive answer to this question (unless they were working in the Baltimore County DA's office in 99-00). There are a lot of factors that go into plea bargaining, some political, some bureaucratic, some legal, some evidentiary. But based only on the substantial weaknesses in the evidence (including, and in my personal view especially, with respect to proving premeditation) I wouldn't think that a plea down to 2nd or manslaughter would've been out of the question here.	20141128T235525
EvilSockMonkey	3	0	One of the factors in the latest appeal is the allegation that Gutierrez failed to follow Adnan's instructions to investigate a possible plea bargain. http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-adnan-syed-serial-20141120-story.html	20141129T041224
EngineerinLA	1	0	I wonder that myself. However to take a plea deal you have to admit your are guilty. If Adnan has been continually maintaining his innocence to everyone including his lawyer, then why would he take a plea deal? Similarly, if Ms. Gutierrez was confident she could win based on the state's reliance on Jay's flip-flopping testimony - why try to get a plea deal? I'll leave the real answer to the lawyers, but I would suspect that the sentence would in some way be tied to how much remorse Adnan would show in his admission of guilt and what the sentencing guidelines (if Maryland had any) were for whatever charge Adnan would be pleading guilty.	20141128T230548

anonymous	1	0	I don't think that necessarily applies with violent crime- it doesn't where I live. Also keep in mind it's not what the law said today- it's what it said when he was sentenced.	20141129T164034
whitenoise2323	2	0	Saad commented at some point about Adnan considering the kinds of plea deals that let innocent people out after many years. Kind of like the West Memphis 3. He could, if exonerated, get out of jail but would likely have to plead guilty in order to do so. Saad said it was a tough decision and he didn't think Adnan had an answer.	20141129T005445
TominatorXX	2	0	when you have an 18 year old client looking at natural life without a plea it seems to me an attorney would have to at least find out what a plea bargain would look like.	20141129T025401
anonymous	1	0	the West Memphis 3 case was a very specific kind of plea though. there was about to be a new trial declared and the prosecutor thought he was not going to convict in a new trial (due to people's memories being 15 years older most likely) and so he essentially gave into the public and financial pressure (avoided a costly trial and civil lawsuits) and had them take the plea where they say guilty but get out free. the only reason there was going to be a new trial was the State of Arkansas had heard arguments based on new DNA testing of evidence around the scene.	20141129T024211
whitenoise2323	1	0	Sure, seems true. I also know that Saad said Adnan has already considered the possibility of pleaing guilty to get out of jail.	20141129T075715

EsperStormblade	13	0	"It was creepy. But it also sounded to me like she perhaps didn't truly *believe* Jay's story. Jay would lie about stuff, right? So Hae goes missing and Jay tells her this story and she's like ""whatever Jay. Yeah, right, Adnan killed Hae. Yeah. And you have a unicorn."" So she knows but doesn't know, know--and when she hears the report, she's like OMG, he wasn't lying. That's sort of how I read it."	20141128T222855
KPCinNYC	-1	0	Adnan cant keep straight if asked Hae for a ride or not. Does that make you sick to your stomach too?	20141128T230718
anonymous	1	0	I really think it's true that Jay didn't tell her about the murder/burial until the day her body was found. And I also think that's the day they went to get rid of the evidence. For some reason, they thought it would sound less incriminating to do that the very day she was murdered, rather than the day she was found. It makes me think that Jay never would have pinned it on Adnan or said a word about it had the body never been found. I still think this somehow leads to Jay having done it all on his own.	20141212T150304
Jellysleuth	1	0	I think its all down to this particular line of questioning being outwith anything she has learned off by heart talking with Jay. Most other questions are about what she 'knows', this is about how she 'feels' and she wasn't ready for that, so ties her whole thought process in knots.	20141129T002614
MusicCompany	9	0	"She knew from Jay that Hae was dead. So instead of saying Hae was missing, she said ""Hae's body."" It's consistent with her statement."	20141128T223923

Cabin11	3	0	I hear that. This could be interpreted as Jenn piecing things together in the moment of the interview, when she could have been previously in denial.	20141128T232534
Cabin11	4	0	"Actually, I posted about that earlier today, saying his excuses seem ""suspiciously circular"" regarding the ride request. There's a lot to consider here, and being put off by one thing doesn't mean I've passed complete judgement one way or the other. I think it helps to look at everything with a raised eyebrow in this case, don't you, especially since we are only getting pieces of the story bit-by-bit?"	20141128T231658
TrillianSwan	4	0	That's not strictly true. He doesn't remember saying that to Adcock, and corrected the next person who asked him about it. It's *possible* that Adcock misunderstood. I tend not to see this as a differing story, but I can see how people do.	20141128T231401
Cabin11	1	0	"Interesting. After reading your comment, I asked myself, ""Would it have sounded that much more incriminating to say they ditched the evidence only after the heat started coming?"" And I agree, it would have, regardless of the possible framing of Adnan. Also, this would work toward throwing the cops off the scent of the dumpster evidence if Jenn and Jay could convince them the stuff was long gone weeks ago. But then in this scenario - where Jenn didn't know on 1/13/1999 - why bring up the shovel(s) at all? I mean if they're lying their faces off here, why doesn't Jay just say, ""Adnan borrowed my shovels, I don't know what he did with them, I never saw them again."" I mean Jay's prints are wiped off by this time, theoretically. What's one more tiny lie? But Jenn testified first, so that's what they have to go with. And if the cops do find the shovel(s), they also find a red plaid jacket and some imitation Timberlands that clearly don't belong to Adnan. So Jay has to at least concede that he was present for the burial. (Jay and Jenn also might be thinking, ""How do we account for dirt from Leakin Park showing up in Jenn's car, if the cops find it?"" so they feel like they have to mention it.) But if I'm Jay, why in the world do I even bring Jenn along for the evidence dump? What possible good would it do to add a witness? But then I remember the fact that brings it all around: Jay doesn't have a car. Whatever the actual timeline, I keep wondering if Jenn blew a lot of their script in her first interview and Jay is basically picking up the pieces as he goes along. Sorry for the rambling, but I'm enjoying the thought experiment. Thanks for contributing."	20141212T193018
Cabin11	8	0	"And that's what I keep coming back to. She should have known exactly what that news report was about, unless she was in denial. Or: Jay told her the whole tale the night before the interview and asked her to pretend she knew about it earlier, thereby making his account more believable, and explaining why her tenses and pronouns are so inconsistent. She didn't realize how much her ""knowledge"" of the events should have colored her mindset between 1/13 and 2/26 until she started talking. Wondering, not accusing here."	20141128T233159

bencoccio	3	0	If Adnan is purposefully lying about asking Hae for a ride, then that means killing Hae was very premeditated and that he had always planned to ask her for a ride and get her somewhere to kill her. Right?	20141129T051148
KPCinNYC	7	0	Adcocks notes from the first interview were pretty clear so its a total reversal in my view.	20141128T231751
batutah	7	0	Yeah, I totally read that as Jenn getting tripped up on the story Jay had told her the night before and remembering what really happened at Champs in light of what she was supposed to already know that night.

Cabin11	11	0	Im not sure what your endgame is on this thread? That only your cherry-picked selections should be considered significant where reddit is concerned? When did I ever imply that what is discussed on reddit will have any legal impact on anything? This particular thread was started with questions about a specific page of a specific testimony. You are absolutely entitled to voice your opinions about Adnan and the ride request, but my point is there are at least a half dozen specific threads that address this discrepancy. You popped into this thread with an unrelated comment, and even that implied I wasn't giving proper weight to what is an entirely different aspect of the case - an implication I refuted by pointing out that I had already posted comments about your topic earlier today. On the relevant thread.	20141128T235623
TrillianSwan	2	0	Well, I believe the theory would say this was a mistake on his part. (Ask for ride = plan; tell cops = oops.)	20141129T075054
bencoccio	2	0	That's a pretty big oops.	20141129T081159
TrillianSwan	2	0	I agree.	20141129T081450
TrillianSwan	1	0	"> might give an answer that could hurt in the long run That's what I meant by a mistake. But thanks for jumping in, it's hard to explain a theory I don't believe in. (For me, I think Adnan never said that, Adcock misunderstood, or more likely from being high, Adnan misunderstood the question and answered incorrectly. The very next time he's asked about he says ""no, no, that's not right""-- contrast this to Jay who's like, ""yeah, I lied last time but..."")"	20141129T193513
joppy77	6	0	I don't think it's ever been verified. I've wondered the same thing. Even if she did, it would only signify that there was another reason she might have met with Jay by herself. Certainly no judgement of her is intended. Incidentally, I knew couples in high school and college that had one partner who smoked and another who didn't, so it wasn't all that uncommon in my anecdotal experience.	20141129T004717

anonymous	1	0	When Rabia was still on here, she said that Hae did.	20141130T051903
blink5694	1	0	It could be important though. It would create a potential link between her and Jay and possibly give Jay a motive to kill her. Maybe she owed him a ton of money or he thought she was going to flip on him? It would also generally open it up to more possibilities for suspects. If she was involved in the drug world even remotely she could easily end up with the wrong person at the wrong time.	20141129T030248
anonymous	9	0	I was just telling my husband that I know I can't fault someone for not acting the way I would act in any given situation. But, I think if my high school ex of a week went missing and the police called me looking for him or her, the first thing I would do is think back over my day to when i had seen him/her and what all my interactions with him/her were like that day so I could try to assess his/her state of mind and see if I should worry or just assume California. But that's me.	20141129T000123
hazyspring	5	0	I agree this is the biggest problem with Adnan's story. His foggy memory does not make sense to me, given the events of the day. Also, one of the others problems to me is that he denied trying to get a ride with Hae, but other people heard him ask her.	20141129T004527

marland22	1	0	I just realized something when reading a comment from /u/bassplayayo -- I can remember exactly where I was the moment I heard terrible news a little later in the day (Michael Jackson dying, Space Shuttle explosion, etc.) But I can't remember what happened during those days prior to hearing the news. Same goes for when I recall personal tragedies that happened late in the day. But for 9/11, which happened early in the day, I remember more details about the day because of the impact it had on everyone for the entirety of that day, and for years to come. I'm curious whether that's the case for others. Edit: fixed formatting on another redditor's name, and also clarified the reason why I remembered the details of the day 9/11 better than other impactful events (because it was early and impacted the whole day).	20141129T164648
KPCinNYC	6	0	I would expect to see a high level of concern about her being missing. Adnan himself said that Hae would never do anything after school because she had to pick up her cousin from kindergarten, right?	20141129T002350
marland22	1	0	I would absolutely do that too (or at least I'd like to think I still would, even high as a kite). It's just that I honestly may not recall details of my own day that didn't relate directly to my ex.	20141129T165533
ShastaTampon	11	0	"I can't stop thinking about how Adnan tells the detective during the call on the 13th that he had asked Hae for a ride. Then refutes this on the second call 7 days later when asked if he had said that. And the reason he gives for not asking for a ride is that HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT BECAUSE HE HAS HIS OWN CAR. So perhaps sometime in those 7 days he began concocting his ""I don't know. It was just a normal day. What I would have normally done"" defense that he maintains to this day. He says he doesn't remember saying he asked for a ride in that first call, but he also told SK that he remembers that call vividly as he was a high teenager with weed on him talking to the cops. But he doesn't remember that rather crucial detail of having told the detective that he asked Hae for a ride. Just the call in general."	20141128T230935

Page 62 of the transcribed interview, describing the call from Officer Adcock to Adnan: ""He doesn't know where she is, he hasn't seen her. Tells him to look for her old boyfriend um, that, that ah, that's just how she is. She's a flighty person like that, um, check with her friends."" Page 99, same interview: ""He gave them other people's name to try to look for her and told him that that was her personality."" I found this interesting since a) no one else described Hae as flighty and b) it should be easy to confirm whether Adnan did in fact say this to Adcock."	20141129T145513

Kingfisher-Zero	2	0	I started wondering that too. There's one comment on the podcast explanation of the timeline [here](http://serialpodcast.org/maps/timelines-january-13-1999) (See the last column) where they say that Jay's story in the trial is pretty consistently 1 hour off of the cell records. The problem with the theory by my math is that the times are off in the wrong direction. The most likely scenario would be that the cell records did not reflect Daylight Savings (so no fall back). In that case, they would all be an hour LATER than Jay's story. It is odd that his story in the end lines up but is roughly consistently an hour off. Maybe everyone in the entire story forgot to roll their clocks back that year! (Nailed it!)	20141128T231919

This does not sound like what Jay would say, ""granted you didn't like her"" -?- also, interesting that Jay says "" she deserve to die."" Rather than, but did ""you have to kill her?"" This comment fits more with a possible scenario, in which Hae is killed in the ""mix"" of a drug deal gone bad, as they say. Jay said (appeal document) that Adnan called for address to a shop in East Baltimore. Could it be that this ""shop"" was a place to buy drugs, that Hae and Adnan went together, something happened. Hae gets hurt/killed. Adnan calls Jay and says that since Jay's contact is responsible, Jay has to help ""clean up."" Jay disagrees - even if his contact, not his deal."	20141129T013036

Hopper80	13	0	This is one of my bugbears. A few more phone records - Jenn's in particular - to cross reference and get a firmer shape of the day from the mess of the various interviews seems vital to me, in terms of building an investigation from the verifiable facts up. Get Jenn's phone records. Where possible/necessary, ask those who had Adnan's mobile number for permission to check their call records. Check the call records of the Best Buy phone(s). Check there was even a phone there. For a witness who lied and lied and lied, the police seem to take his word as true a lot. I also wonder if they looked for the call Nisha does remember talking to Jay on, from his work. Look for an evening call to Nisha on a confirmed day of Jay's work - that'd be something.	20141129T010000

Ok then, I guess I'll help you bury her' 'Thanks man' 'No worries. Say, if this all comes out you will say that you killed her and I was just helping you out with the burying for some completely inexplicable reason and explain that I didn't tell anyone, even after it goes to court and I find I'm facing life+30, because you asked me to, won't you?'

Nutbrowndog	1	0	Jay's hand was forced--forced to cover up a crime he didn't commit by a myriad of circumstances that factored against him. He didn't listen to his own instincts when Adnan told him about the murder--he blew it off. He told Jenn he was concerned on that very day before it went down and Jenn told him don't worry Adnan is just a weird dude. Adnan told someone about it right in front of Jay and Rabia even thinks that person is who made the anonymous call--she says so on her blog. If you read the entirety of Jay's police transcripts you will see he says the same story over and over but changes time lines and locations so as not to implicate all of the people he told who were then in a bit of heat because they had foreknowledge and also did nothing.	20141129T173237

The cops even corrected Jay to tell him that he didn't have a rap sheet with just one conviction. Then Jay goes through this whole explanation of incidents with cops such as drawn guns, helicopters, dogs, and shit. I think some of this was fabrication on Jay's part. Such stories, especially involving police helicopters, should be easily corroborated. I've had some friends who have been rough around the edges and have had multiple run ins with the police. I've witnessed guns drawn but then quickly holstered and the whole scene de-escalate and faster than it escalated. I don't think any of this necessarily makes Jay a liar…just a young person trying to be tougher than he really is."	20141129T015249
Xtina1853	0	0	what if it was a gang initiation	20141129T013921
thirdpartytheory	-1	0	Yes, gang initiation of Jay is a good suggestion. Adnan doesn't seem the type to join a gang but Jay certainly could have considered it- especially if he thought he could outwit his initiators. He might have gotten in too deep too quickly and after feeling what it was like to kill Hae, realized the danger that his girlfriend was in and how easily she could be killed. Both Jay and Adnan would be far too low level/naive to out maneuver a gang once such an act was committed, but if gang members suggested how Jay could pin it on Adnan then Jay wouldn't have much choice. Adnan knows Jay doesn't have a choice but also must stay quiet on this. Hence Jay's many backtracking stories that have to cover both his own tracks and that of a third party.	20141129T015609
kramer772661	3	0	Yeah, it all makes perfect sense. Jay seems so like the kind of person that would join a gang. He is black and all. So Jay was about to join a gang, and in order to do so, he has to kill a random person. And he decides what the hell, he'll kill Hae. And he'll strangle her to really look hard. I'm sure that impressed all the hoods in this imaginary gang. Or maybe he was being jumped into a gang, and Hae stumbled upon it by mistake. It was probably happening right outside Lenscrafters. I can just see her walking into meet Don, and then she sees Jay being stomped and kicked by various gangsters. Then the gangsters kidnapped her and strangled her. Then Jay framed Adnan. It's all very likely.	20141129T090614

timmillar	32	0	"""We got a very confessional moment from Adnan, where he pauses and repents almost breaks down - all but admitting he did it."" THAT'S your understanding of Adnan's expressing his regret? That's a truly extraordinary interpretation, and I feel somewhat bewildered by it. Even if Adnan was guilty, I can see no reason to think that he meant anything other that what he said - that he was sorry he hadn't been a better muslim. ""Sarah will never conclude outright she thinks Adnan is guilty. But between the lines, in the silences, in the editing and in the music, she already has."" I can only guess about which lines you've been reading between to draw that conclusion. Did I miss an episode or three? I am at least as certain as you are about your speculation that SK is all but certain he is innocent, but needs to keep a degree of doubt in the listener's mind for the sake of the podcast and the nature of the story. ""A sad reality will occur to all of us when we come to terms with the fact that Adnan simply did kill his ex-girlfriend with no real motive, because his 17yo self saw murder all around him and trivialized it."" Even if Adnan is guilty, this kind of speculation about his motive and the relationship of his society to the crime is fatuous and speculative. Whoever did the crime did it for reasons that most people are going to have trouble understanding - your conclusion that it was caused by a society's trivialization of murder verges on the absurd. You are right that the show cannot conclude with a big ""here is the truth"", because the nature of the story is that there is uncertainty and ambiguity and conflicting interpretations. It's human nature - and the nature of the law - to want certainty, but in real life the truth cannot always be absolutely determined. FWIW, I think that it's more likely that the show will end with some discussion related to the nature of the US judicial system and the pressure to convict people, rather than to find the truth. Regardless of Adnan's innocence or guilt, he was convicted almost entirely on the testimony of a deeply unreliable witness. The prosecution shaped and cherry-picked from his testimony to create their case. Maybe despite that the right guy has been in prison for the last 15 years - but if it was YOU being falsely accused of murder, is this the way you would want the prosecution to proceed against you? Is the way this case proceeded truly the best the judicial system can come up with in the name of finding out the truth?"	20141129T014552
Archipelagi	6	0	The story will not end with the show. Adnan's appeals will be ongoing for a minimum of a year, at the very, very shortest. More likely two or more years. Even after *Serial* wraps up, it will be a long time before we know the outcome.	20141129T025247
serialmonotony	12	0	I don't know where you get the idea that 'we have hugely bought into the idea that Adnan is innocent' or 'nobody wants to consider that Adnan is guilty'. It seems that the audience is split down the middle. Lots of people say they think he's guilty. You yourself have said you think he's guilty. I think, if anything, the show is walking a fine line in keeping things perfectly ambiguous so that only the most closed minds can say that they are absolutely certain either way.	20141129T011548

If she goes for the easy way out and says, ""I just don't know, but I think the case was flimsy"" I will be very pissed off that I donated money to the next season... The earlier episodes practically begged you to see Adnan as an innocent victim. But as everything has come out -as has been detailed meticulously on these forums- the amount of luck and coincidence to come up with an alternative to Adnan's guilt is staggering beyond all measure (""everyone is lying AND the police are framing him for some reason AND the cell towers coincidentally pinged the wrong tower AND Nisha got butt-dialed AND Jenn is an accomplice to murder and and and"")...

lizard6	8	0	But it's also about children - 17 year-olds - who are exposed to a culture that normalizes murder. It's about Baltimore. A sad reality will occur to all of us when we come to terms with the fact that Adnan simply did kill his ex-girlfriend with no real motive, because his 17yo self saw murder all around him and trivialized it. This is a little ridiculous. Guess what? I grew up in Baltimore County and now live in a neighboring county. In my 33 years of life, I've never seen someone murdered. I never knew anyone who was murdered. I never knew anyone, who knew anyone who was murdered. Shocking, I know! Adnan and his friends were not inner-city kids. They lived in middle-class homes where they certainly were not exposed to murders on a daily basis.	20141129T013240

keginkc	3	0	I didn't interpret that as an admission of guilt for the homicide. I took it as acknowledging the part that his drug use and illicit relationship with her had in the unfolding of events, be it hae's death, hae's mother's suffering (memory of which precipitated the comment as I recall) or his own incarceration. I think he's basically saying that although he didn't kill her he is where he is because of other things he did at the time which he should not have done. But I haven't spoken to him myself and am only going on what amounts to a few seconds or minutes of dialogue. Which is something I have to constantly remind myself: I'm only hearing a tiny fraction of Sarah's conversations and can't really formulate anything out of that other than hunches based on gut feelings. Same goes for Jay or anyone else. I can't pretend to know any of them of what's really going on in their head. Which doesn't prevent me from thinking that Jay is either a compulsive liar or a coerced witness and that I'm currently not aware of any information that makes me, albeit as an individual and not a juror, believe Adnan guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Which is not to say he didn't do it, just that Jay's testimony is not enough to make me believe he did. And I think learning more about his plea deal will only harden my suspicion of his testimony. At the end of the day it's a matter of belief. And I think that goes for everyone in any camp with regards to who committed this crime. I'm not sure we'll ever have a definitive answer, short of someone confessing, which is I think improbable bordering on impossible, unless the serial crew is sitting on something really big (which I doubt). Sorry for the long sort-of tangent.	20141129T055643
anonymous	2	0	"I think it is a lot to presume that kids in Baltimore are more inclined to murder. I grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina…a town that has earned its reputation as ""Fayettenam."" It isn't Baltimore, but it is definitely a town that is rough and has frequent murders. However, that doesn't make *everyone* from Fayetteville a murderer or a possible murderer. Also, this show is crafted for your regular TAL listener. It's NPR (or American Public Media or whatever). It may be one of the most popular shows that have come out of public radio in a long time, it is still public radio. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the story were left with an incomplete ending or an ending that doesn't come with closure. Lastly, SK is probably going through the emotional roller coaster that I would expect. Adnan seems like he was a popular kid in school. He probably gave off a lot of positive energy that made people like him. That persona can survive prison…(although most of the people I know who are charming and have been to prison weren't lifers in for murder, so there is that). But SK is dealing with the same issue…if Adnan didn't kill Hae, then who the fuck did? He has been tried and convicted by a jury. The way our system of justice works…that is a pretty powerful onus to overcome. Unless I knew Adnan personally, I would have a hard time just letting his jury conviction go. So, I can see where SK would want to like him, but there will always be thought doubt…he's been tried & convicted. I suspect Adnan will remain in prison. Overcoming a conviction is a huge task. And unless there is a bombshell in an upcoming episode we don't see coming, I don't think we are close to his earning a new trial or having his jury conviction vacated."	20141129T010234

It is about the storytelling, you're right, and many people have taken issue with that, with worlds like ""exploitative"" coming up regularly. The show is obviously entertaining, but I don't believe all of this will end up nowhere. I assume the most we'll get is a ray of hope, a statement that Adnan and his lawyer(s) will pursue a new line of appeal that has become possible because of SK and Serial. She doesn't owe us closure, but anything less will be disappointing."	20141129T041214

From reading your response, I get the feeling that we're thinking of two different things, that you're thinking of the case of the murder of Hae Lee, and I'm thinking more about Serial itself, what the show means and how it's produced, and the show's own system of morals and messages. It exists in a narrative world a few layers removed from facts and figures.	20141129T024439

k9copz	5	0	I agree. SK has said in interviews she doesn't know how the season will end. My sense is that she's being pulled along by the investigation as much as the listeners, just a few days ahead of them.

nautilus2000	3	0	Seriously. There are so many threads here that compare Adnan and company to the Wire and life in West Baltimore. Woodlawn isn't a wealthy area, but it is nothing at all like West Baltimore and much more similar to a typical US suburb. These kids owned cars, were going to college, lived in middle and maybe even upper middle class in Hae's case homes, and were worried about their prom rather than food on the table. Lumping in this case with the crime culture of Baltimore makes zero sense. These kids did not see murder all around them...they saw Best Buy and the mall.	20141129T053039

I feel very clear about the interconnection between real-life events and the podcast. I don't think we're talking about different things at all. I do think we have a radically different understanding of the information we have been given. You said ""I suppose I'm a sceptic, but nothing in the show ever made me believe in his innocence."" I can equally say ""I suppose I'm a sceptic, but nothing in the show has ever mad me believe in his guilt"" What does scepticism have to do with it one way or the other? I would have thought that scepticism is about remaining open-minded and not being too sure of any possible interpretation. SK seems to me to display a deep and admirable scepticism. My inclination is to believe that underneath that scepticism she actually believes Adnan is innocent. Your inclination is to believe that underneath that scepticism SK believes he's guilty. Clearly, as far as creating a good podcast is concerned, she's therefore doing a great job. ""[the podcast] exists in a narrative world a few layers removed from facts and figures."" Well maybe, but Hae really was murdered, someone really did commit that crime. Yes we're listening to a story, but a huge part of the power of that story comes from the the tension caused by a genuine possibility that an innocent man may be imprisoned. In your OP, you said that the the show is less about who really did it than it is about in-depth journalism - the kind we get so little of in these days of twitter and instagram (if you'll allow me a little riffing on your theme) - but journalism has to be about real issues and real life if it is to be of value. I don't accept your conclusions about what the show is really about even though I agree with you on this point. BECAUSE the show is in part an exercise in in-depth journalism, it's about much more than ""the trivialisation of murder"" (which I think is your personal issue - I can't imagine how you could interpret anything the show has given us to suggest that this is an issue or concern for SK) or some morality-tale about misguided youth. There's a genuine question about whether a real-life tragedy for one family was compounded by an inadequate investigation and a bungled defence. Good journalism does its best to answer hard questions - it doesn't fall back onto moralising or posturing about the nature of society. I don't know how they're going to get out the of dilemma of there being no hard answers here - but I trust and hope it's not in the manner you've described."	20141129T034959

I guess my original ""skeptical"" position comes from the fact that he was originally found guilty, which I do take for granted by and large, and don't really reconsider without new evidence. I don't think a podcast is really equipped to investigate things like this properly for justices sake, especially 15 years later, without some new exonerating evidence like DNA or something. Because I don't trust a public radio producer in this capacity, I certainly don't trust my own judgement on the matter, basing my opinions on a series of podcast episodes that are designed more to tell a story and to engage emotionally than to deliver facts in an unbiased way. So I have to just take for granted that he's guilty, because frankly the show doesn't offer any alternatives. And if I must pick at one detail, it would be Adnan's lack of contempt for Jay. To me that speaks volumes. There is what happened, then what was told to investigators, then what was presented in court, then again, then Sarah's interpretation 15 years later, then her interviews, then her editorialization, then our interpretation, and each of these layers after the first contains abstractions so for me it's not a useful endeavour.

She even says things like ""since last week, I learned..."" but I honestly think that's a polite fiction, and what she really means is ""since last week, YOU learned"". In other words, she's had the beginning, middle and end of this story paced out since before episode one. All interviews are in the can, as well as all research. She's likely doing her own voice recordings and episode editing just-in-time, week to week, like a TV show would, but beyond that, it's ""in the can"". Do you agree?"	20141129T012426

timmillar	0	0	"Fair enough, nicely said. ""So I have to just take for granted that he's guilty, because frankly the show doesn't offer any alternatives."" Well, not quite. It offers the alternative that he's NOT guilty. And if you want to be pedantic and get into semantics, it also offers the alternative that he's innocent. It doesn't suggest who DID do it, assuming he's innocent, mainly (I guess) because that would open up the prospect of all sorts of law suits. Given that, I don't think it's quite fair to say that there aren't any alternatives. Reading between the lines, the alternative is pretty clear. I disagree that the podcast isn't equipped to investigate such things. Of course - even if there was a very strong conclusion that Adnan is innocent, his situation isn't going to change. It's up to the law to do that and there are other threads explaining just how difficult that would be. I'm not sure why Adnan's lack of contempt for Jay speaks so strongly to you. If he's innocent, it's in his interest to prove that he DIDN'T do it. He has no capacity to prove that Jay did it, so it would make sense that he wouldn't necessarily focus on Jay - especially after 15 years of work trying to come to terms with it. Moreover, if he's innocent, he doesn't KNOW that Jay did it. He only knows that he didn't do it and that Jay is lying about him for his own reasons, which he can't understand. Lack of understanding doesn't necessarily lead to contempt. On the other hand, if he's guilty, his lack of contempt could play either way. It could be because he can't muster any contempt, given that Jay is actually telling the truth about Adnan murdering Hae. Or it could be because he is trying to play innocent and he thinks that looking calm and at peace is the best means of pretence. I'm not at all sure what it is you imagine that his lack of contempt actually says. In regard to the podcast not being a useful endeavour, I'll go back to my point about the fact that a man was convicted here on the testimony of an admitted liar who changed his story multiple times and whose final testimony only roughly corresponded with the events that could be independently corroborated. Whether Adnan is guilty or innocent, it seems to me that there is a very serious issue here in regard to the administration of the law and the nature of the investigation. I agree that it's not a whodunnit. But that doesn't mean it's not a useful endeavour, or that important and worthy real-life conclusions can't be drawn from the manufactured story told by the podcast."	20141129T060355

twerq	5	0	"We never get any emotion from Adnan about Jay. He should be at least saying, ""Man, Jay is lying"" quite s bit and ""Jay ruined my life"" and ""I've worked very hard for the last fifteen years to forgive him, he must have his reasons, but I find it very very hard. Sometimes I'm so consumed by it think some very dark thoughts"" and stuff like that. You've done some quality thinking about the facts presented and all the possible scenarios and concluded that Adnan's position on Jay is not a relevant point. Within that framework, sure, you're right. I'm purely going on his tone in the interviews because frankly that's all we have to go on. When I talk about exonerating evidence like DNA and stuff, I do so because only a few types of things can be uncovered at this point, 15 years later, that would shed any real clarity on the situation. Just yesterday in my city a 30ish year old man was released from prison after spending 12 years in jail wrongly accused of murder. They tested hair clippings that were found to be beard hair and not head hair and so the man didn't shave his head immediately after the crime as accused. That's new evidence, and it has a truth to it, uncomplicated by the passage of time. All the old trial evidence and testimony is lost to time, it has no context or clarity or truth. I suppose Serial hoped it would find some beard clippings, but I think at this point that ship has sailed. As I said in my op, Adnan's interviews are the most important part of the show (even if they are heavily editorialized), because they're one of the few things we get to witness first hand that reveals some truth in the present day through his statements and tone of voice and pauses and hesitations. What he does and especially what he does not say."	20141129T124134

anonymous	3	0	"I don't think they began the show by assuming they'd uncover something that would resolve all the uncertainties. I think they began the *reporting* over a year ago thinking that might be possible. SK says it herself over and over. She thought that finding Asia and getting her on the record would do it. She thought for a while that the key to the whole case was figuring out who made the anonymous calls to the police. Then later it sounds like she was never able to resolve her own doubts. We know that she talked to the Innocence Project people back in March -- and at that point she was still squirming about her ""sociopath"" scenario. But they would have been constructing the basic shape of the story all along, and definitely had a narrative line (set up, conflict, climax, denouement) in mind long before the first episodes were aired. They're still doing interviews, still following leads, still writing and recording, but that's not the same as just randomly writing whatever comes up from week to week. What I want to know is . . . what was the information they got that forced them to re-write and re-record their episode 5 on a dead run, finishing just a couple of days before they aired it?"	20141129T005825

anonymous	1	0	What I find pretty interesting is that people are assuming SK went all the way to Best Buy and just checked out the parking lot. I am assuming SK checked inside the store. Hell, they even talked to the landlord and had original blue prints to check out the store. So, now I'm presented with two options: A. SK went through the whole ordeal to just never look inside the front doors to see if there could have been a phone booth in the alcove. I'm 44 years old, and I remember phone booths. If SK is anywhere close to my age, she would have remembered them too. Checking the alcove would be what I've done. B. SK did indeed check the alcove but just didn't bring it up. What dramatic purpose would it have served? In all likelihood, B seems to be the more logical explanation. If it is A, then SK is really stupid. I want to believe B, and B just makes more sense to me.	20141129T014527

From Hae Min Lee? When and how did Hae arrange for Jay to await a call?

Because it's the fact that he let Jay ""hold his phone"" that he got caught and/or unfairly imprisoned (depending on your view). It's because Jay was calling Jenn all day and the trail led from Jenn to Jay via the phone that Jay felt pressured to tell police a story (true or untrue) about what happened that day that implicated Adnan. So what does Adnan regret? That he let Jay ""hold his phone."" He doesn't mention keeping company with shady characters. He doesn't mention doing a bunch of drugs that may have impaired his memory. He doesn't even say, ""If I'd been a good Muslim, and not had a relationship with Hae, I never would have been suspected.""

EsperStormblade	17	0	"I am inclined towards this train of thought but want to add another thing I noticed that goes to Adnan's potential ""feelings"" about the crime. In the last podcast, he says that it wasn't until Hae's mother speaks in court that he realizes how he might be perceived by Hae's family. (That alone is incredibly, incredibly narcissistic and myopic. I mean, really? Wouldn't one of your FIRST thoughts be: OMG, her family must think I'm a monster? But I digress.) But instead of compassionately identifying with Hae's mother, he thinks of his own mother and thinks how she is losing a son. His concern is for his own family's suffering; he says almost nothing about Hae's family's suffering. A similar thing happens later in the same episode in his conversation with SK. The ONLY time Adnan even sounds remotely emotional is when he is talking about the impact all of this has had on his family, on his brother. When it comes to Hae, he is almost glib--cutting out pictures of girls who ""look like her"" and sending them to Krista. When I mentioned that it was creepy on another thread, everyone told me I was weird for feeling it was creepy. But if you listen to the episode, SK clearly finds something ""off"" about this too. In a very upbeat manner he is like, ""Hey, doesn't this girl look like Hae?"" For multiple reasons, Hae should mark the place of trauma for him. She was his ex, she was murdered, and he--by his own account--is falsely accused. But he has zero emotion about that. But when it comes to him and his family, plenty of emotion there."	20141129T021135

The trauma over Hae's death was described pretty graphically in that same podcast. Do you really think he should have spent the entire period in a state of emotion over Hae? At what point does he get to feel sad about what his own family is suffering? Also he's writing to Krista, who is also Hae's friend and who remained close to Adnan. Does Krista seem disturbed by it? They've been exchanging friendly & detailed letters for several months at that point.	20141129T023513

agavebadger7	5	0	If Adnan also told Tayyib that he killed Hae, that would make him one of the stupidest murders in the history of murder. According to Jay, Adnan tells him one or two days prior that he's going to kill Hae, which he does in broad daylight in the parking lot of a Best Buy, or in the library parking lot, then he shows Jay the body in the trunk...in broad daylight, then he tells Tayyib that he killed someone, too. Really? Someone telling that many people that he killed someone does not sound like someone who would protest his innocence for 15 years. The guy Jay is describing loves to brag and loves attention. I'm surprised Jay didn't also say Adnan took out an ad in the news paper. [Edit: wrong location cited.]	20141204T051604

If the body were found in Woodlawn, it would have been the Third Circuit (Baltimore County & Harford County). Different judge, different demographics, different jury.

lizard6	2	0	My dad was a MD State Trooper at this time. I asked him this question and he said it was probably because when the body was found (in the city) there was no evidence that a crime had occurred in the county. If the county were to get jurisdiction they would have had to prove that a crime occurred in the county. City took jurisdiction because it was obvious a crime was committed there (burying a body).	20141129T150959
CoronetVSQ	2	0	No, Baltimore City is an independent city. It is not part of any county but functions like a county. Baltimore County is separate with its own police, courts, and government. Woodlawn High is in Baltimore County. Leakin Park is in Baltimore City. When Hae was reported missing, the matter was investigated by the Baltimore County police. When her body was found in Leakin Park, Baltimore City had jurisdiction and took over the investigation.	20141129T125152
mdsnbelle	1	0	Based on where his house was described as being, I'm actually putting him in Harford County.	20141129T204123

shapshapboetie	1	0	Thanks. The burial site bit was implied in your post so I thought that might have been the reason. My question to attorneys was whether that alone makes it the proper venue. If I were Adnan's defense counsel, I would contest jurisdiction and put in for a change of venue to Baltimore County. The defendant and the victim were from the County. Unclear where the strangulation happened. But Jay's statement would clarify that if they weren't such bullshit.	20141129T153739
uglypig	1	0	Really? I had assumed Carroll county given that he worked in Owings Mills	20141130T013735
shapshapboetie	2	0	"CVSQ and I are making certain assumptions which are, like it or not, common to attorneys in trial courts. In short, the County is richer and more educated, but also whiter. The County is [60+% white](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_County,_Maryland#Demographics) and the City is [60% + black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore#Demographics). That kind of thing. The assumption is that those suburban juries - no matter their race - are ""better,"" more insightful, or more demanding juries. They may also be tougher on crime and less forgiving of people who grew up in bad circumstances. But here, the key question is whether they would put much faith in Jay. SK spoke with a juror, and she seemed to think of Jay as a novelty. The kind of ""helper"" that everyone has in the family. I see him as a scumbag who, at the very least, heard a murder was in the works, helped a friend bury the body, did nothing about it, and then lied his way to a plea bargain."	20141129T153357
CoronetVSQ	3	0	That's a fair question that I have been kicking around. I remember when this was going on and Baltimore County homicide detectives were investigating the matter early on but that is not getting much publicity on Serial. Baltimore City was inundated with homicides that year with 305 reported in 1999. Baltimore County does not list the specific number of homicides for 1999 but the five year average of homicides for the year ending in 2002 was 28. There are some old and cold homicide cases in Baltimore County but generally speaking, their homicide units are well staffed well regarded. I am inclined to believe that Baltimore County would have taken their time and been very thorough with this investigation but we will never know.	20141129T150759
mdsnbelle	1	0	But until Hae's body was found, there really wasn't 100% confirmation that a crime had even taken place. In cases of missing adults, like Hae, most of the developments don't happen until after the body is found and proof of a crime has occurred. I don't think it was a difference in the jurisdictions, necessarily, that kicked the investigation into high gear, but instead a pinpointing of the fact a crime had actually taken place that did it.	20141129T205458
mdsnbelle	2	0	"Now you've got me thinking. I remember his house being described as being in a ""county NorthXXXX of Baltimore."" I thought it was East, but it may have been West. If it was West, you're spot on for Carroll and it would make his getting to work easier. If it was East, I'm still thinking Harford, and that would explain why the early-morning gas station receipt on that side of the county. Do you remember what episode that was? I'm happy to check the transcript."	20141130T070948

gaussprime	1	0	I have the opposite sense. Remember how we heard from SK's investigator that this was an above average investigation by the police? My guess is the reason is because it was Baltimore City, with more competent and experienced murder police. If this was the county investigating it, we may well have even less to work off of.	20141129T152805
uglypig	1	0	"I don't remember the episode, but I thought it just said ""an adjacent county"". I hadn't tried to place it in reference to the gas station receipt, so maybe you're right."	20141130T145133
mostpeoplearedjs	2	0	Based on reading Homicide by David Simon, it's my understanding a lot of jurors in Baltimore City would accept that a young black kid would be distrustful and scared of the police and would be untruthful about collateral matters to protect himself or his drug dealing associates. Simon describes a population in Baltimore highly suspicious of the police. The homicide detectives profiled in the book say they would frequently deal with hostile and uncooperative witnesses-they'd come up to a shooting scheme and everybody would claim they didn't see anything, even the observers who weren't involved. I live in a rural area, and most of the people I live with would expect a witness like Jay to be immediately and completely truthful with the police. It's my impression a lot of jurors in Baltimore City would not be surprised if Jay wasn't. One only needs to turn on the television coverage of Ferguson to see different communities have different relationships with the police force.	20141129T162851
shapshapboetie	1	0	"Yeah, it's not a science. Just a general assumption about education levels and trust in the justice system, witnesses, etc. From what I know, I doubt middle-class, suburban white families would see Jay as having much credibility, nor would they see being ""streetwise"" or as a ""helper"" as redeeming thing to be. Or that it lends credibility to his statement that he helped Adnan clean up the mess. But, I wouldn't say that Jay (black) would be favored or trusted more than Adnan (Pakistani/ immigrant) no matter the jury. I wouldn't know. But others might speculate that juries would treat them differently due to race and demographics."	20141129T160548

gaussprime	0	0	Sure. I don't know anything about them in particular, but in general, I would venture big city homicide departments are better than smaller ones. Sheer practice and institutional knowledge makes you good at things.	20141129T231628
uglypig	1	0	Yup, you must be right, then!	20141130T175142
mdsnbelle	1	0	Yes, sheer practice does. But it doesn't mean that people who (luckily) don't see homicides every weekend aren't *competent* at it. The folks of the BCPD are just as competent and highly-trained as those with the BPD. To imply that they aren't without any knowledge of either department outside of what you've heard on the podcast is an insult to the good men and women of the BCPD, especially those in the Woodlawn district who have seen the city crimes bleed into their jurisdiction time and time again.	20141129T234856

He probably learned a few lessons from his pops and uncles who were all busted many times for possession with intent to distribute, possession - not marijuana, distribution, manufacture, etc. I think Jay at the very least has some pretty hard core criminals in his family and that gives his claim a bit of legitimacy.	20141129T221103

EsperStormblade	18	0	"I agree; it is inflected by racial assumptions and also class assumptions. The middle class, Asian American honor student who always put on his best face to world? Of course he's not a murderer. But the black drug dealing kid from a broken home? Of course. Of course he's the murderer. LOL When I have brought this up, people always says they dislike/distrust Jay not because he is black or working class, but because he lied. But when you read all the documents and listen to the interviews and so on, it's bristling with class conflict. When Jenn talks about not liking Stephanie and Hae, she says they are ""stuck up,"" it is clearly about class differences. When we hear about why Stephanie's parents don't like Jay, it's clearly because he's a working class kid from a single parent home. I'm not saying he's a boy scout, but neither is Adnan. I have made the comment before that painting Adnan and Jay as ""opposites"" really misses the point about both of them. They had a lot in common--they both had sort of dual sides to their personality. Adnan was out doing drugs and stealing money and having sex (maybe even with prostitutes) and generally living a lifestyle completely different from his ""public"" lifestyle. And Jay, who had family members and undoubtedly community members, who were in and out of jail, who knew, but wasn't himself, some actual drug dealers, who took care of himself and his family, was also this kid who liked to go hiking, who all the smart kids apparently loved, who liked to hang out and talk shit, tell stories, smoke weed. I really don't see much difference between Adnan and Jay, except that Jay turned out to be softer in the end. I think Adnan and Jay did this crime together, all of it--planned it and executed it--but I think things got too real for Jay when he saw Hae's body and he deviated from the plan. Because of Jay had done what Adnan did, ""I don't know anything, I was just hanging with my boy Adnan all day,"" nobody would likely be in jail. But Jay went soft. But this idea that somehow Adnan is the angel and Jay is the devil? Yeah, it's completely nuanced by racial tropes whether people want to reckon with that or not."	20141129T134617

whitenoise2323	1	0	I think maybe your perception of the structure of drug dealing and drug rings is a little bit off. Not everyone in the trade is a kingpin.

At the same time these Twitter friends are giving evidence of their own perceptions. This is not probative of anything he said in the interviews. And the important point is he uses this perception - either real or not - to also explain why he didn't go to the cops as well. Truth is, his criminal record begins after Hae disappears. If he has a record it's when he was a juvenile and sealed.	20141129T140720

If Gutierrez botched Adnan's case due to illness, Adnan and Rabia shouldn't have to pay for it. It was still her responsibility to recognize her condition and step down. She shouldn't get a pass for ruining a potentially innocent person's life, out of pity for her illness.

etcetera999	4	0	The one issue that bugs me about an Adnan premeditation is this: Why would Adnan ask Hae for a ride in front of her friends if he premeditated her murder the day before? How the heck was he planning on explaining that away? One possibility: he asked her in front of her friends, knowing that she would turn him down (b/c of cousin), and it would make it look like he never got a ride. Later on, he saw her alone (and maybe intercepted her in the parking lot at school or the library), and convinced her to give him a ride (or at least let him into her car).	20141129T033622
Dysbrainiac	4	0	"If you don't know you have to go with the most probable, ie how most murders occur. In a previous comment I have mentioned one of my favourite quotes from a cop: ""Never underestimate the number of times when a murder occurs that neither the murderer nor the victim had any idea what was about to happen 30 second before it occurred."" A lot of people here on reddit loves motives and so do TV-series, films and juries. But they forget about boring every day murders are just as other form of violence, like punching someone, most commonly done in the heat of the moment, for stupid reasons, without much thought about consequences. Legally they are probably often is deemed premeditation anyhow. In this case since we don't know if Jay tells the truth or not when testifying that Adnan though about killing Hae hours/days/weeks in advance. We have to value the probability of this beeing true in conjunction with the method, strangulation, which is extremely intimate and violent, and probably requires anger and rage. We also must consider the apriori probability of a planed murder, which is low, since most murders are not. And the fact that regardless of who did it between Jay and Adnan it was poorly planned. Considering all these fact, I at least, come to the conclusion that it is more likely that it was not preplanned/preconsidered, and thus Jay lies about this, thus lessening the likelihood that the rest of his claims are true."	20141129T105157

bencoccio	1	0	All of Jay's versions of the events involve premeditation. IN his statements and testimonies, he has Adnan talking about killing Hae a week before, a day before and hours before. The state argued that the murder was premeditated - they even charged Adnan as such by also charging him with kidnapping (the state's theory was that Adnan asked for a ride from Hae in order to get her somewhere to kill her, so therefore that ride constituted kidnapping). For my money, if you think Adnan killed Hae, you kind of have to think it was premeditated simply because in order for him to be in a position where *he could* kill her, he's got to waylay Hae out of what sounds like a really hectic after-school schedule. There are certainly tons of folks on this sub that are convinced that loaning Jay his car and phone were the early stages of Adnan's plan, meaning he always wanted to involve Jay as an accomplice (which to me just sounds silly). I guess Adnan *could have* just wanted to talk to Hae, and then she agreed to that, they went somewhere, and the talk turned into an argument. But If that happened, why involve Jay? And then why make it worse by *threatening* Jay? If it *was not* premeditated, then all of the stuff before the murder would be innocent: he loaned Jay's car just as he said he did - for present buying purposes. He and Hae would have to find themselves together in an unplanned way that could develop into a non-premeditated murder. That to me seems hard considering both their normal after school schedules and what we know about where Adnan was.	20141129T045818
Nutbrowndog	1	0	Just my opinion but premeditated. He worked himself up to it and sounds like he thought or imagined Jay would help before or after the fact and be his alibi. That didn't work out for him. He asked Hae for a ride because he had no other way to get her alone--and he thought he could say later that he got a ride to Best Buy and Jay would corroborate--perhaps Jay would say he saw Hae drive away. This from Jay's police transcript: He told Jay multiple times and it wasn't until his demeanor change and the plan of giving Jay the car that Jay actually worried it might be true. Jay was in a fix because he agreed to take the car to go buy weed--he already owed Adnan a hundred bucks and was beholden to get some weed to pay it back. He took the car knowing about the plan but figured Adnan wanted to get a ride from Hae just to talk--he said as much in the police transcript. Jenn knew beforehand too and didn't believe it either. This makes sense as to why both had to collude to cover up aspects of the crime after the fact--they didn't think it would really go down and then were caught with the foreknowledge and had to scramble. Every single one of Jay's lies is about excluding a person or people from the story who unwittingly hung out with either Adnan or Jay that day and Jay didn't want to draw them in any further.	20141129T201102
ReasonandEvidence	4	0	We need to distinguish between premeditation and intent. Adnan may not have planned the murder out, but still intended to kill her in the heat of the moment. Whether a plan to kill her was put into effect that day is the question.	20141129T164409

LadyJusticia	1	0	This is a huge point for me. Unless you are a serial killer who kills for fun, you would not choose manual strangulation as your method if you planned the murder in advance. Manual strangulation occurs in a sudden rage. Also, there is a risk that the victim could fight back and escape or call attention to what's happening. It can take a while to kill a person this way - 10-15 minutes or longer. I am basing this on the expert opinions in a murder trial involving strangulation. I was on the defense team. I wish I could remember more of the details of what they said. There must be articles out there on this topic.	20141130T002202

partymuffell	2	0	* Adnan bought a cell phone the day before Hae disappeared. * Adnan lent his brand new cell phone and car to Jay that day. * Many people including Adnan testify to Adnan asking Hae for a ride after school. It seems to me that these facts (as well as others) support the premeditation theory as they support Jay's account of events. All of those would be mere coincidences in the non-premeditation scenario and, everything else being equal, theories that postulate coincidences are less strongly supported by the evidence than theories that don't.	20141129T165620
ReasonandEvidence	2	0	It was extreme brutality. When I saw the news clip of her talking about balancing sports, her job, and academics, it became real. Someone squeezed her airway shut until she died. There are less problematic methods. She might have scratched the killer. Of course, the fact that the perp(s) buried her suggests someone was worried about what the criminalists and coroner might find. It seems like a case where forensic evidence would be very important, but that wasn't the case.	20141129T074016

asha24	1	0	I had free periods during my last two years of high school, every student had the option of having two free periods during their four years, I had more because I took extra classes in the summer. Also he could have had his core subjects the semester before, the last semester of high school has always been pretty slack.	20141129T111234
Kruegergirl2881	1	0	My high school was open campus and during my last semester of senior year I had the majority of my requirements in. That being said school on some days for me would be done quite early. Oh and because you knew what classes were legit and what ones were BS it was easy to ditch and no one cared.	20141129T172532
anonymous	1	0	It was the second semester of senior year (January). But regardless...a teacher's (well, former) perspective. It would have depended on a few things. First, what the state guidelines were for these subjects. It was a public school, which meant they just had to go by the credits required by the state. Things are changing constantly, so you can't go by what the laws are today and I didn't have much luck on a quick search for the 1999 standards in Maryland. Anyway, state requirements vary. For instance, some states require 3 math credits (which would be three years), some require four. Some states require biology, chemistry, and one other science. Some just biology and one other science. I taught at a private school, which meant that instead of the 40 credits required by the state, we had 55 credits. So, even though the state said you only needed 3 math classes over 4 years, we had to take 4. Etc. Etc. They also may have had independent studies or externships or whatever else that took up some of the free periods - maybe they required to job shadow or volunteer or whatever. No idea if this is true, but it could make up for some of this free time if there was a co-op or some program (and since it was the very beginning of the semester, it's possible this hadn't started yet). Again, no idea if this is true, but it was the case at my school for Juniors 2nd semester. To contrast... my fiance teaches at a really crappy charter school right now. They only require 40 credits, so over half of his seniors will be on half days next semester because they only need a couple more classes. So kids literally come in for 3 hours. It's absurd.	20141129T032159
lizard6	1	0	I'm speaking from memory here, but I think MD state grad requirements in 1999 were as follows: 4 English credits, 3 Science, 3 Social Studies, 4 Math, 2/3 Language In my experience a lot of kids double math in junior year, but the kids I knew who did that took AP Calc senior year. So, yes, his schedule seems really light, especially for a magnet program student, but enough to graduate. Adnan was accepted into Univ of MD, College Park, which isn't super easy to get into, so I assume his schedule in junior year or early senior year was more rigorous. Woodlawn is not a highly ranked school in the county. Also, it was January, so 3rd quarter, not 1st semester.	20141129T032845

USER_R	1	0	Agreed. I haven't thought about high school classes since I graduated... But we had periods 1-8, and there was even a 0 hour. Some people got out after 7th period and or had a study hall.

I always tried to tell my students that, but it's a hard thing to accept, ha. Another thing I just thought of - I don't know much about the funding for Woodlawn or the type of school it was economics-wise, but it could simply be they didn't offer electives because they couldn't?

8shadesofgray	24	0	I've also found it odd that Adnan seems to know so little about Jay, but pretty much everybody SK asks says they were acquaintances at best ... Including Jenn and Jay himself. And it's not like Jay has provided a very well-rounded description of Adnan, either. Both seem to acknowledge that Stephanie was their almost exclusive reason to know each other at all.	20141129T044839
anonymous	37	0	Honestly, I smoked a good deal of weed in my day. I was an honor student, too. Some people I smoked with were genuinely good friends, but other buddies who were around -- maybe I knew if they went to my high school or another, probably knew where they worked for meeting up purposes, and knew a lot about their favorite music and food because that's what mattered when we were high. If they were dating a friend, maybe a bit more. If they were just smoking buddies...I don't think it's that weird. It could easily be a defense mechanism or Adnan's method of discrediting Jay, as well, just adding my experience.	20141129T052052
anonymous	24	0	I just posted this in a comment, but: > I think it's also possible to interpret Adnan's calm demeanor as indicating innocence - If I'd been in prison for 15 years for a murder I didn't commit, I'd either go insane with frustration, or I'd learn to cope by forcing myself to accept it. I think that Adnan might be a little wary about SK's whole process, and reluctant to point fingers, because it's a huge psychological risk for him to get his hopes up. He's had over a decade to work on accepting his situation, and it would absolutely suck if he started looking forward to freedom for nothing. This is actually exactly what any clinical psychologist would advise Adnan to do in this situation - it's so much easier to cope with terrible things, even the biggest injustices - if you make yourself accept them. You actually see this attitude in other prisoners who've been wrongfully convicted (for example, I remember noticing this a little bit when watching the Central Park 5 documentary, and that was *after* they'd been released). Of course, this interpretation is within the hypothetical situation that he is innocent - I'm not saying that his demeanor is proof of anything, but it would be perfectly plausible for him to act that way even if he is innocent.	20141129T054526

Jay got away with it. When Sarah asks him about that he goes: ""Oh, yeah, I dunno, I don't wanna say anything bad about him because that's how I got here. I dunno why he said that stuff."" WHAT THE FUCK How are you not completely enraged by the mere mention of Jay? Why haven't you been *screaming as loud as possible for as long as possible* that Jay is the killer and he is lying and he killed your girlfriend? Why isn't he angry? Why hasn't he ever been angry?

If he's guilty, he's not going to earn any points from people like SK if he just rages & screams about this guy who screwed him over. In fact, that would play into the prosecution's idea that Adnan is full of rage, etc. If he's innocent...well, have you ever known anyone who went to prison for a long time? I dated a guy pretty seriously a few years ago, & without getting into too many details, his brother was sent to a max security prison for 10 years for a crime he wasn't mainly responsible for (all the shit SK detailed about how bad the investigation/trial was seemed like deja vu for me). The crime happened before we met but I was there through the sentencing & his first few years in prison. I wrote to him semi-regularly for a few years, & he was definitely angrier before going into prison. He said once he got there, he started to really take his religion seriously, which helped chill him out. Also, considering he wasn't really a ""hardened criminal"" before going in at age 21-22, he said prison is pretty scary. And if you're an angry guy, living in really close quarters with a ton of other guys, with no privacy at all & having to take orders at all times...man, if you stay angry? You're gonna fucking snap. You're gonna make your life 100x more miserable by getting privileges taken away & having more time added on. If you learn to accept where you're at & come to peace with it, your time is gonna go by a lot faster. Plus, if you're known to be a decent guy who doesn't get in anyone's face, no one else will bother you. I actually think it's funny that Adnan is even willing to talk about the case/trial/whatever, bc the guy I knew wouldn't. Even though (I think) he got royally screwed by our justice system, he accepts his role in it & just wants to move on with his life. That's a big selling point on Adnan for me...because if he IS guilty, I think he would've come to terms with it a long time ago. It seems so odd to me that he'd still be telling people he's innocent (if he's not) when he knows that he has about a 0.00001% chance of ever getting out (well, until the Innocence Project got involved, I think the odds are better now). Of course, this is just from one guy I knew who went to prison. I'm obviously not a psychology expert or even a prison expert. I just think it's better for Adnan (whether he's innocent or guilty) that he's learned to be calm about it."	20141129T075455
sjeannep	3	0	"I think this whole drug dealer-buyer relationship concept is ridiculous. 1. They are entangled in each other's lives. Adnan is best friends with Jay's girlfriend. They spend hours and hours together, driving around visiting people. You have more than just a dealer/buyer relationship if you spend lots of your free time together and are both the closest people to Stephanie. One or the other, maybe I could believe to be a more superficial relationship, but not both. They knew each other very well. If we are to believe that story about the Stephanie gift, Adnan felt comfortable enough with Jay to pressure him to get Stephanie a gift. If we are to believe the Jay motive about Adnan and Hae being privy to Jay cheating on Stephanie, that seems like they are very involved in each other's lives. 2. Also, Jay had a legit job back then, while he was dealing pot, right? ""Drug dealer"" is such a loaded epithet. Doesn't it seem like he was just cutting down his own weed costs by buying in bulk and making a little money selling weed to his friends? Ok, technically a drug dealer, but I think his identity as drug dealer is way overstated. I am not an expert in this area, but if you are a real serious drug dealer, isn't the point not working some shitty mall job or whatever, which is what Jay was doing?"	20141129T144700

readybrek	2	0	From what we've heard Adnan was much more the friend to Jay than Jay was to Adnan. There is nothing to suggest that Jay lent anything to Adnan but it seems that lending his car to Jay was a regular event for Adnan. He's worried that Jay hasn't gotten Stephanie a present. It is possible that the friendship is one way because Jay is a bit of a bad boy (possibly not as bad as he thinks he is) and Adnan is a bit of a goody two shoes so Adnan admires Jay rather than is his friend. The pathetic comment and reluctance to talk about Jay is more about him being a bit repulsed about feeling any kind of positive things about Jay, let alone admiring the man.	20141129T174300

Wouldn't it be morally acceptable for him to be angry with Jay about that and calling him out on that. If Adnan is innocent, Jay is withholding the information to exonerate him. When asked to describe Jay shouldn't he say, a deeply manipulative sociopath who casually hung out with me after he conspired in the murder of my recent ex-girlfriend.	20141129T151019

It's not going to make him look innocent, it's going to make him look crazy. Maybe he thinks no one would believe him. Maybe he told Gutierrez it was Jay and she didn't believe him, or didn't think there was anything that could be done about it other than trying to make him crack on the stand. There's no way for him to prove Jay did it. Jay admitted he helped with the burial, so his DNA being found at the burial site won't change anything. Maybe he thinks he shouldn't point the finger at someone he knows is a murderer out of fear of retaliation against his family and friends. We haven't heard everything Adnan has said and done in the past 15 years or even the past 6 months.

Now you have decided that because he acts in a way that is strikingly different than you would under the circumstances, that he must be guilty. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with projection, and/or transference. Objectivity, otoh, is a bit more rare. Most humans aren't blessed with a natural capacity for it, as we are usually run by our emotions. Once we latch on to something that is confirmed by our core belief system, and we identify with it, are loathe to let it go. Feels like an attack on self at that point. We are all pattern seeking primates. My opinion..strive to keep an open mind, be self aware and maintain objectivity. Doesn't mean that you can't explore theories...just avoid attachment. Not directing this at any one person, just my own perhaps useless musings to the ether-land.	20141129T053718
anonymous	36	0	If I would hypothesize-- I suspect some of it has to do with his religiosity. Islam is very strict about the punishments of false testimony-- someone who testifies falsely earns the anger of God. In Islamic judicial cases, someone who makes a false claim (or even a claim without sufficient evidence) is given a punishment himself and his testimony can not be admitted in court thereafter.	20141129T045323

I think if you interviewed maybe a year or two into his prison sentence, he might be more angry, but at this point, so much time in prison has gone by, he can't just sit there enraged or else he would just rather die. At some point, you have to live and make a life for yourself...even if it is in prison and you are innocent."	20141129T152030
JackTrigger	20	0	"I just joined reddit solely to comment and say THANK YOU! I don't understand why people aren't talking about this more. An innocent Adnan KNOWS that Jay framed him and had a hand in Hae's murder. This innocent Adnan is not going to prison for life without kicking and screaming until the bitter end. This innocent Adnan would be investigating Jay himself, and demanding that the police investigate Jay. This innocent Adnan is going to work with police to convict the KNOWN killer. By giving the testimony against Adnan and showing the cops where Hae's vehicle is located, Jay has essentially TOLD an innocent Adnan ""Hey Adnan, I killed Hae, and I'm framing you."" An innocent, confident Adnan would DEMAND the police investigate Jay, provide the police with possible motives of Jay's, and desperately and carefully try to recall all facts of that day and all relevant information on Jay, in an attempt to put together what actually happened, and how exactly Jay killed Hae. Nothing has indicated any of the above took place. Why? Because Adnan is not innocent."	20141129T063123

asha24	9	0	Witnesses have said it was normal for Adnan to lend his car to Jay, Jay regularly picked him off from track. The only thing odd about that day was the cell phone, but since it was new we don't really have any previous behaviour to compare it too. My point is, the fact that Adnan lent Jay his car isn't evidence of anything because an impartial witness has already said this was a regular occurrence. This has been discussed many many times.	20141129T104547
birdsofterrordise	3	0	I can tell you still to this day that kids lend out their shit, which we would never do as adults. I have seen over time that kids are more private about their phones, but that is because they either are talking shit on texts or have naked pictures of themselves/others. You have to remember in '99 a phone couldn't do a whole fuck lot that they could do even five years later. In 2007 when I first started teaching good lord, all the times I would confiscate a phone and it was actually Gabriella's and not Mary's who was in trouble in the first place. I borrowed friends phones in high school (late 90s, early 2000s) frequently and I definitely know acquaintances that lent out cars because having beaters was much more common than today, when I see kids driving nicer cars than I ever had and gas was cheap as fuck. In fact, my older brother let an acquaintance borrow his car for his pizza delivery job. Why? Because they're idiot bros, that's why. Also, leaving campuses used to be much more common and now that is practically nonexistent, unless it is strictly school sanctioned.	20141129T152844

Another place Adnan totally flops? And i mean TOTALLY flops? When SK asks him about why he never called/paged Hae when she went missing. His response is some bullshit about how uhh.. i was talking to everyone everyday, i didnt need to try to call Hae because i got my information from others. First of all, there were FIVE days before people were back in school ""talking every day"". And not once during that time, or after, did he try and reach out. Even though he called her 3 times the night before the murder."	20141129T181139

I don't think it's weird at all that Adnan would leave his phone in the car when he lent Jay the car. He just wouldn't have needed it in school. Also, less likely to get stolen. I would have probably lent my car to some people I ran with in those days..not all of them.	20141129T144104
toyfulskerl	6	0	"Your **brand new** cell phone and car. That's one of the things that has stuck with me. Adnan loaned his brand new cell phone to this guy who was ""more of an acquaintance than friend"". An 'acquaintance' who he hung out with a whole hell of a lot. And the day that he does this, the day that he remembers being Stephanie's birthday (and he even remembers what present he got her), the day that he remembers getting a call from the cops asking about the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend while high, **this day** doesn't really stick in his memory at all. ""It was just like any other day."" ""I guess I would have gone to the library."" ""I probably would have gone to track practice."" ""I guess I would have gone to the mosque to meet my father."" Adnan is unbelievably vague about that day, a day that should stick in his memory for any of a dozen reasons."	20141129T124433

asha24	6	0	This point gets brought up several times a day. And we do know of one time that Adnan does point the finger at Jay, when he tells his lawyer about Stephanie. Yet most people completely dismiss it because obviously a guilty person would try to pin it on someone else. So you see how an innocent person acts is completely subjective, whether Adnan is accusing Jay or not, people would still think he's guilty or innocent if that is what they're inclined to believe and thus put their own spin on it. Also, I don't think any of us are in a position to predict what the normal behaviour of a man who has been in prison since he was 17 and who will remain in prison for the rest of his life would be.	20141129T103501

He whispered ""You're pathetic"" under his breath and the bailiff heard him say it. Pathetic is not something you call a person who is trying to frame you. Pathetic is something you call someone you think little of. Someone you don't respect. Adnan called Jay pathetic because they agreed not to snitch, and Jay snitched.

They wanna keep theorizing and posting and looking forward to new information that might change their mind. Or maybe it's just me. Once I became convinced of Adnon's guilt, which was about halfway through where we are now, I lost interest. Not all of it, and I still wait impatiently for each episode every Thursday, I just do so with less enthusiasm because I feel like it's a podcast just dragging out the inevitable at this point.	20141129T073336
readybrek	2	0	The point I am obviously failing to make is that perhaps Adnan feels ashamed that he once liked Jay so he deals with that by not thinking about Jay at all. A kind of denial if you like. The not calling Hae thing is easily explained because Hae told him quite clearly that she didn't want him hanging around when they finished in November. So when they finish in December he tries to respect that - he tries to call her 3 times the night before to show off about his new phone, if he had spoken to her the first time he wouldn't have called again. I think she was the fifth person he called so he was obviously keen to show off his phone to all his friends. I think it was Aisha who said they all first thought she was with Don - then when they got back to school they conjectured she'd gone to California to be with family. As an aside - doesn't Aisha also corroborate Asia's story about the weather? Asia says a snowstorm kept them away from school - SK says the weather does not back that up but Aisha also says they were kept away from school because of the weather on that weekend.	20141129T193546
EnsignCrunch	6	0	It's definitely something that seems to vary from place to place (It would have been out of the ordinary at my school). I think the most salient question is how common it was at Woodlawn at that time and we haven't heard anything suggesting it would be unusual. I think it raises peoples eyebrows because it fits in with other suggestive facts: Jay apparently picked Adnan up after track practice pretty frequently and was dating one of his best friends. That doesn't make them good friends, but the ignorance he's pleading seems a little exaggerated.	20141129T151608

anonymous	2	0	"I mean, based on what he's told SK, he was in shock. He didn't see the accusation or trial coming beforehand at all, which fits the innocence narrative. And he was angry and Jay - I think that came out in the ""pathetic"" comment. Think about it - Adnan never really had a venue to air frustration to the public when he was on trial. His lawyer definitely would have coached him on having a calm (I.e non-violent) demeanor, and it's not like he was doing a lot of newspaper interviews or anything. So we're not really having access to his feelings until now, all these years later. Tbh, the speculation that his demeanor indicates guilt is based on some pretty poor understanding of pathology and/or reaching on the part of people who think he's definitely guilty (I haven't made up my mind yet). It reminds me a lot of how people refuse to believe rape victims, because they don't act the ""right"" way after the attack - it's a really dangerous assumption to make. Remember that in season 7, the legal/criminal experts she interviewed all agreed that Adnan's behavior seemed consistent with innocence, and I think they'd know better than most people here."	20141129T152533
anonymous	4	0	"Adnan says to SK that at the time, he was mostly in shock. I think that it's *possible* to see his lack of anger as guilt, but I think it also fits well into the innocence narrative. I mean (presuming innocence *hypothetically* here), he knows he didn't do it, and he's just a kid, so why would he think that he's actually gonna go to jail? Plus, he's just lost someone he really cares about. That could really muddle anyone's emotions. He does demonstrate some anger - the ""pathetic"" comment proves this. But it's not like he could sit in court and yell at Jay all day. His lawyer counseled him not to speak, so he never really had the chance. He was trying to come across as a calm, non-violent person, and understandably so. So yeah, he was probably angry (among other things) 15 years ago, but we'd have no evidence of that. And now, when he's been in prison for so long, it makes sense (again, hypothetically assuming innocence here) that he'd have come up with coping mechanisms. It makes a lot of sense to try to accept what happened and move on. It's either that, or go crazy with the frustration. And it sounds like that's exactly what he's trying to do: ""I have a life, it's just not the life I thought I'd have."""	20141129T162208

For all he knows, Jay is as innocent (of the murder) as him, and maybe its an acquaintance of Jay's. As to the second point-- yeah. I used to smoke weed and the relationship you have with your dealer is always kinda weird.

sabremetric	2	0	Or if Adnan & Jay were up to something really bad together (drug dealing?) that Hae knew out about and was going to reveal (giving Jay motive to kill her), but for Adnan revealing the truth would be worse than going to jail for a crime he didn't commit. And if this was the case, and Adnan didn't kill Hae, then it makes sense for Adnan to maintain his innocence, because he knows Jay's testimony is rubbish and should be disprovable, which would then set him free.	20141129T103015
partymuffell	8	0	No, people dismiss it because it's a totally implausible motive for murder (Adnan himself only offers it as a possible motive for Jay falsely accusing him not for Jay murdering Hae!). if Jay were jealous of Adnan and Stephanie (which we have no reason to believe he was), he might have motive to kill Adnan (and it's really a stretch unless S was steppin' out on J with A) but jealousy doesn't give him motive to kill A's ex girlfriend. The fact that Adnan's supporters even consider that a potential motive shows the level of their desperation and the strength of the case against Adnan.	20141129T105615

I keep having to remind myself he was essentially still a kid. Secondly, I have noticed people falsely accused of something this terrible are extremely reticent of accusing others without 100% certainty, as they know the horror of being wrongly accused---look at the West Memphis Three, you think they'd be screaming alternate suspects, but they aren't and really never have. I'm still on the fence, I don't trust Jay, but when I think of people I hung around with at 17, especially people that maybe were a boyfriend of a good friend, I couldn't tell you much of anything about them.

joppy77	2	0	Your first paragraph seems to have a lot of truth. I hadn't exactly thought about it in those terms, but I suspect there is truth in it, at least for some people. They're so down the rabbit hole of the mystery, and enjoying it the way we all enjoy a good mystery, that (maybe unconsciously) they don't want to give that up since the cultural event of Serial is not over. It's almost like someone not wanting to know a major spoiler that will ruin the end of a tv show. And then there is also another group of people who are generally angry toward the justice system--and I don't disagree with them, generally--that they can't bring themselves to admit that Adnan could actually be guilty. But my feeling about that is that Adnan's actual guilt or innocence doesn't change the fact that it was not a just trial. I also think there are people who are just swept in by Adnan's charisma, which has set off my sociopath/manipulator alarms since the first episode (although I fully recognize that such instincts are very slippery, even for seasoned psychiatrists/psychologists).	20141129T094528

Someone made a really interesting point about this earlier today: the police and detectives investigating the case really did *such* a shoddy job. Once they had their sights set on Adnan, they sort of stopped looking at anything that didn't point to him. So if it was someone other than Adnan, it's really hard for us to recognize the signs, since the detectives didn't really look for them. For example, my mind keeps going back to Jenn's early testimony, where she says that when she called Jay a little after 7, a strange adult man answered the phone. I *wish* the police had looked into that more!!	20141129T065431

anonymous	14	0	>As to the first point-- I think he is hesitant to point the finger at Jay because he really does not know that it was him. For all he knows, Jay is as innocent (of the murder) as him, and maybe its an acquaintance of Jay's. But he can still say that Jay is lying about all the things Jay is lying about. Like pretty much ALL of Jay's testimony. >As to the second point-- yeah. I used to smoke weed and the relationship you have with your dealer is always kinda weird. You don't know them that well, but theres an inherent trust since you know they are just as hell-bent on staying away from the cops as you. Besides, it was a shitty Accord apparently, not some nice Benz or something. There is no way in hell I would give my dealer my car (which he could get caught in with weed, thus getting me in trouble) and my phone (I could get aiding and abetting) to my dealer unless me and him were fucking tight, man.	20141129T053238
old_mold	3	0	as to *your* first point, word i think that makes sense. as to your second point, the relationship you had with your dealer doesn't sound anything like the relationship jay and adnan must have had to be driving around smoking pot for hours, lending each other cars to go get their girlfriends gifts, and oh yeah aiding and abetting each other in murder cases. at least not as I have been envisioning it... if you drive around and smoke pot with someone a lot for hours on end, it's safe to say that you and that person are tight	20141129T061645

asha24	5	0	Doesn't he say Hae wanted to confront Jay about him cheating on Stephanie? Thereby implying a reason for Jay killing her? Yeah I agree it's thin, but my point is accusing Jay isn't going to make Adnan appear innocent, how someone is supposed to act when they're innocent is completely subjective. I think the main reason Adnan doesn't accuse Jay is because he's trying to come off as a nice guy on the podcast.	20141129T112631
The_Chairman_Meow	7	0	> look at the West Memphis Three, you think they'd be screaming alternate suspects, but they aren't and really never have. You're wrong. For years, Damien Echolls and his supporters accused Mark Byers of being the killer. They accused him loudly and proudly on camera. The entire second HBO documentary is really just this very thing. They even accused him of later murdering his wife. Mark Byers was later exonerated in the same forensic process that exonerated the WM3. Damien Echols wrote a letter of sincere apology to Mark Byers, Mark Byers apologized to all the families and they forgave each other.	20141129T154747
Silly_Crotch	6	0	"It is a terrible point because it is not how people behave in the judicial system. A suspect is surrounded by his family and his counsel and is constantly reminded to keep a low profile so as not to undermine his credibility. A suspect, whether he is guilty or not, also has time to understand the situation and the enormity of what is facing him so it is unlikely he would blow up in court and hurt his chances (noone likes a belligerent suspect). On the other hand how Adnan reacted is exactly how most suspects would react in court: whispering ""you're pathetic"" to Jay is a slip-up, something which is much more likely to happen in extremely stressful situations such as a trial than a huge scene."	20141129T134710
patchlingzoon	1	0	"Collusion? Friendship? Perhaps Jenn and Jay were attempting to minimize Jay's relationship and therefore involvement with Adnan in all regards, as to exonerate Jay of any suspicions regarding the murder and/or of any of his drug-related crimes/dealings. Another possibility is ""bad evidence"", or unreliable perspective. Maybe Jay and Adnan were better friends than Jenn actually knew them to be. Perhaps Jay even kept Jenn in the dark about certain details of the involvement. Fear is also a good motivator. We're talking about teens here, being put under oath, coached by attys to bullshit on key points for maximum effect."	20141217T035337

anonymous	2	0	Touché. But if that's what we're doing, then I think Adnan's reluctance to point the finger at Jay only reinforces Adnan's positive, albeit aloof nature. If there's a common thread in Adnan's actions, it's actually positivity. Just think about it: the Stephanie gift situation (which Adnan and Jay both recount), the casual/colloquial letters to Becky from prison, the reluctance to place the blame on anyone but himself, his recollection of moments of kindness during his arrest. He focuses on hope and positivity. Having said all of that, he's either a super awesome, wholesome, aloof guy who had the world's shittiest day, **or**, he's a goddamned monster. It seems to me that's there's really no in-between. I tend to think Jay's story is so ludicrous that it's very likely he's the former, not the latter. If we had anything concrete to point to the monster theory, I'd entertain that notion. But as of now we don't—we only have Jay. And I don't believe Jay.	20141129T190330

anonymous	2	0	Thank you for pointing that out! You're absolutely right, all the stuff I had been reading regarding Echols was in relation to Terry Hobbs---I guess he learned his lesson from the Byers debacle. However, it looks like he was now says he was urged to accuse Byers by his lawyer? I'm not sure how I feel about this now. I'm leaning towards terrible advice from his lawyer for the reasoning related to him not accusing Adnan outright.	20141129T210105
anonymous	3	0	But he also says that prosecutors and cops are trying to find a guilty verdict, not necessarily the truth. And a bunch of the other stuff he said indicated his doubt in the certainty of the case. And Jay *did* lie. And we know now that a *lot* of the testimony that he have that tied Adnan to the case is now impossible or wrong. It seems like once you get rid of all the glaring inconsistencies, lies, and contradictions, the biggest pieces of evidence left are: * the fact that jay know where the car and body are (proof that jay was involved) * the fact that jay *says* Adnan was involved * the Nisha call (questionable) * the fact that we can't confirm Adnan was at mosque * the fact that we don't know who had the phone between 7 and 9. Together, those are compelling pieces of evidence that it could have been Adnan. But honestly, I don't think that it's obvious at all. And I think that if the defense had done a better job, and/or if the prosecution had worked on leads other than Adnan and coached Jay and Jess less, the jury would not have been able to find Andan guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt*. And that makes Adnan's guilt very suspect.	20141129T151626

And I'm not trying to convince you that Adnan is innocent, I don't know if he is, nor am I arguing that this is a good motive for murder! My point to the OP was that whether or not it's normal for Adnan to accuse Jay is completely subjective, for every person that thinks it's suspicious, there's another who thinks that's what they would do too. And even if Adnan was screaming from the top of his lungs that it was Jay, that behaviour could just as easily be used by some as evidence of guilt, as his silence is being used now.	20141129T142339

(is your user name an tribute to Wittgenstein?)	20141129T153241
thirddeadlysin	1	0	But, the jury did find Adnan guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on the case the prosecutor presented. For us to say 15 years later, after a yearlong and apparently exhaustive investigation by a third party brought in by someone with a very big emotional stake in exonerating a friend (a third party who seems to still be unwilling or unable to commit to Adnan being innocent or not guilty, let's not forget), that there are apparently inconsistencies is absolutely considering facts not in evidence. No jury would have had the reasonable doubts some of us do, because they apparently weren't presented with anything to refute the state's case. At best, I think that gives you an argument for ineffective counsel. It doesn't get you anywhere near exoneration, proof of collusion, proof of police corruption, or accusing other people of the crime. At least, it shouldn't, since we're all presumably objective and legally uninterested parties being fed cherry picked events and audio by a program deliberately telling us a constructed and compelling story. Personally I'm terrified of how difficult it seems to be to prove the absence of guilt in our judicial system, especially after conviction. Innocent until proven guilty sure doesn't seem like much if the standard for guilt is malleable.	20141129T154313

It's Stephanie's birthday the next day (or something) Adnan, looking out for Stephanie wants to ensure Jay remembers to get her a gift. Adnan gives Jay his car to go to shopping and his phone, so Adnan can reach him or whatever.	20141129T142156

partymuffell	4	0	Sure, the rumor originates with Adnan (but clearly that doesn't make it true---there is not a shred of evidence for it!), but Adnan does not stand by that story anymore. The only potential motive Adnan mentions in the podcast is jealousy towards Stephanie. So why are Rabia and Saad still circulating it?	20141129T143232
anonymous	1	0	Yes it is! Well spotted! :) Ok, I had forgotten about the question of whether or not he'd asked Hae for a ride. But, if he *is* innocent, it makes sense that he would ask for a ride and then forget about it. In other words, that's something that's less compelling than the other stuff on the list, IMO. For me, it all comes down to whether or not he was at Mosque that night. I feel like it would have been noticed by others if he missed worship on one of the nights of Ramadan, and I *assume* that it was a small enough Muslim community that an absence might be extra-noticeable. His father did testify that he was at worship that night, but I'm not sure how believable that it (I'd probably lie too to save my kid in a situation like this). And then, on top of the questions about evidence, there's just the fact that Adnan acts (IMO) like an innocent person. And Jay's and Jenn's persistent lying makes me question everything they say! I feel like the only reason I can't let go of the suspicion that Adnan is guilty is that I don't know who else it could have been!	20141129T155746
anonymous	1	0	> But, the jury did find Adnan guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on the case the prosecutor presented. And many people (including the folks at the innocence project) think that this was a mistake. It's obvious from the jury interviews and what we know about the trial that they didn't really understand all of the evidence or testimony. And I think that anyone on this sub (even people who think that Adnan is guilty) could claim that *based on what we know now about the evidence* Adnan is guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt*. The fact that he was found guilty doesn't mean much in that context. Also, the fact that Rabia brought the case to SK doesn't really mean anything. Yeah, Rabia is biased, but that doesn't seem to have caused SK to fail to be objective. It's not like SK is getting all of her info through Rabia.	20141129T155025
readybrek	2	0	Really? I thought Jay's reaction was odd - you've maintained for years that someone committed a murder. Someone wants to talk about it and you ask - so who did it then? Sounds more like fishing to me, wanting to check they have no new evidence kind of thing. I don't think Adnan should be in prison on the evidence presented because I don't think he is guilty of the crime as presented by the State but to be honest it could have happened a different way and Adnan could still be actually guilty. However, Jay's response is the only thing so far that's made me think that Adnan might actually be innocent of everything.	20141129T173709

How would you know whether Adnan stands by it anymore, he's never contradicted it. Why are Rabia and Saad circulating it? Hmm I don't know, maybe because everyone on here wants to know why Jay might have wanted to kill Hae, so they released the only reason Adnan could think of that he mentioned to his lawyer back in 1999. That doesn't seem that odd to me, they're his advocates and are not unbiased, we know that, they've been pretty open about it. And you're right there is no evidence for it, maybe that's why Adnan isn't constantly talking about how Jay killed Hae, because it'll make him look desperate. Or maybe because Gutierrez already tried pointing the finger at Jay during his trial and it didn't work, so all he's focused on now is his own innocence.	20141129T144840

readybrek	2	0	The Innocent Project getting involved is a big thing for Adnan - not that he gets a shot at having his case properly looked at again but they only take on cases where they think there is a good chance of getting the person off. They're way too busy to take on every case so if they take on a case it says alot about how they view the evidence imo. I rate the fact that they're prepared to take on Adnan's case as far more proof of his innocence (at least of the crime the State accused him of) than any theory put forward on here regarding his guilt or innocence.	20141129T192744

readybrek	1	0	Don't forget though that not guilty beyond reasonable doubt is different to actually being innocent. I don't think he's guilty of the case the State put forward and the Innocent project confirms the standard of evidence used against him was poor. That doesn't necessarily mean he is actually innocent but now so long has actually past that there is no way of knowing who the guilty party is - Adnan committing the crime in a different way to the State's accusations, Jay, Jenn, Suspect X - any or all of them might be guilty but thanks to the lack of thorough investigation, no one will ever know with any certainty.

Each would have to have cliffhangers to keep people interested, which is why 19th century fiction is known for being melodramatic. Of course also, the tagline, 'one story told week by week,' is almost like a 'we are not doing this the way we do This American Life AT ALL' sorta statement...	20141129T053542

etcetera999	5	0	One thing is that Hae is almost certainly in the driver's seat when she is killed right? So, it has to be a location where she can be moved out of the driver's seat without being seen. Otherwise, obviously, the car can't be driven. For one person to move the body, that limits the location possibilities much more than two or more people moving the body (where one car could be used to shield the other).	20141129T173904

PowerOfYes	10	0	"I'm puzzled by the relevance of this route to the case. 1. No evidence suggests that anyone knows which route Hae took. 2. There is no explanation why the gas station and auto repairers are relevant to the case. There is no evidence that puts Hae, Jay, Adnan or the car at either of those places. Why are they such a prominent feature of this theory? Also, gas station and car repair places in a city the size of Baltimore are no doubt a dime a dozen. 3. The phrase ""If I went to that high school, that's the way I'd go."" appears to indicate that you in fact don't have any first hand experience of driving in the area. That reduces the weight we can give this route. 4. The route you've chose from Woodlawn HS to Best Buy requires a number of left turns, and seems unlikely to have been the preferred route. The more obviousway to go was south over Security Blvd, which requires three right hand turns. Particularly over busy periods, it's not likely anyone would take your suggested 'shortcut' (though I'd like to hear it from Woodlawn residents who can recall traffic patterns from the 90s). 5. As it pertains to getting from Woodlawn HS to Campfield Early Learning, you have assumed that Hae would have taken a route over many small roads to 'bypass heavier traffic' but at the same time postulate that it would have been 'much less traveled'. In my experience of driving in cities the world over, where a major road is congested, the subordinate roads tend to be even worse because (i) all the locals use the local roads for shorter local trips to avoid the congestion thereby making the smaller roads a lot worse; (ii) the speed limit is a lot lower on subordinate roads that go past built up areas (iii) many of the roads you've chosen have more traffic lights, fewer lanes and fewer places for overtaking than the more obvious route. In fact, I strongly suspect that at 3pm Security Blvd and the Baltimore Beltway would have been the most obvious way for Hae to drive to pick up her cousin."	20141226T084741

youknowimeanyouknow	3	0	One thing I would like to know is where was Hae headed. The location she needed to be after school. Sometimes when you argue with someone if it gets to intense and you're in a car you stop the car. Maybe the Best Buy parking lot was on the way to where she was headed and the stopped there to argue.	20141221T215040
readybrek	4	0	You may have to tweak your timeline at some point. Rabia says she has a statement signed by a student whom she is almost sure is called Becky and she will post it when she finds it. This student saw Adnan dressed for track approximately 3pm. He was (according to Rabia) on his way to pick up some kind of commendation from a counsellor - she put a picture of the commendation on her blog with the date 13th Jan 1999 on it. Of course we do not have any kind of statement from the counsellor on when it was dated ie did they sign and date these things only when the student picked it up or was it just waiting there already signed and dated until the student picked it up, perhaps many days later. Would have been nice if the police had interviewed the counsellor to see if she remembered seeing Adnan at that time. If he's seen at 3pm dressed for track (I hope Rabia posts that statement) and if his counsellor remembers spending a few minutes with him at 3.05pm, it gets harder and harder to fit in time to kill Hae because we know she didn't make it to her very important appointment at 3.15pm so it's reasonable to assume she is dead or incapacitated at this point. If the counsellors remembers he didn't pick up that certificate that day but does remember another day then the timing for the murder is tight but doable but you then have the problem of driving Hae's car somewhere and getting back to track for 4pm. There isn't an incoming call in that time frame that could be the 'pick me up' Interested to hear your thoughts. Here's the link http://www.splitthemoon.com/?p=266 the copy of the certificate is about 3/4 of the way down.	20141130T133007
readybrek	3	0	There is also a section on SKs transcript that says that police notes put Hae at school at 3pm. >Summer never talked to the detectives, there’s no mention of her in their notes, but she’s not the only person who said they saw Hae after school that day. Becky saw her right after school, Debbie Warren said she talked to Hae too, the police notes say she saw her at approximately 3 p.m. inside the school near the gym which would match Summer’s memory. So you may want to tweak the time available for Hae's murder too.	20141130T141925
readybrek	2	0	Actually this archive document https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-PUUcby-AZWfEhcuW/2002_WL_32510997_djvu.txt tells a different story to the one SK puts forward >The last time Debbie saw Hae on January 1 3 was in gym class, and Hae was happy and rushing to go somewhere at 3:00 p.m. Debbie could not remember where Hae was going, but she told police on January 28, 1999 that Hae said she was going to the mall with Don.

From the podcase episode 2 Krista says it was on their way to photography class and may have been Adnan or someone else >If I remember correctly (laugh) I think Adnan and I were taking-- ah, had a class together, um our first period class was Photography, and she-- they passed each other in the hallway and I was with him and I remember somebody saying or him saying something about “Can you give me a ride after school?” Becky says it was around lunch time (the ""it"" in the quote is the police notes that SK is reading to Becky and Becky confirms is about right. >So, it says, “Sometime earlier that day, apparently he asked her to take him possibly to get car before lunch because it was in the shop. Heard about it at lunch.” So it’s I think, you heard about it at lunch. At about 2.20pm Becky then says she heard Hae say to Adnan that she couldn't give him a ride. She doesn't see Hae after that point according to the police notes which she confirms sound right. >Hae said she could, there would be no problem. At end of school I saw them. She said ‘Oh no I can’t take you, I have something else to do.’ She didn’t say what else. Approximately 2:20.” So that happened at approximately 2:20. “He said, ‘Okay I’ll just ask someone else.’ He told her goodbye.” And then it just says, “Did not see Hae after that.” Edited to place Adnan and Krista on their way to photography - not in it!"	20141130T143904
readybrek	2	0	I think you also overestimate the accuracy of the cell phone pings. It is not 100%. In episode 5 SK and Dana discuss what the prosecution did with the cell phone evidence. An expert and the prosecutions went to the spots that were significant to the story and make phone calls from exact locations, Dana says >So places like Jenn’s house, the Best Buy, Leakin Park where Hae was buried. Those places that are really important. She also adds Cathy's house to that list. How bear in mind that the cell phone expert and the prosecution did the tests together and they knew exactly the location they used and exactly the cell phone it pinged off of (apparently there is some piece of equipment that will tell you there and then). They did 14 test calls. If the cell phone tower data was 100% reliable then you would expect them to use all 14 of those test calls. In the event they used 4. Of course as the prosecution they were under no obligation to present the evidence fully so no mention was made of the 10 test calls that did not ping off the expected tower - that should have been the defense's job (I read somewhere that Adnan's attorney claims she didn't have the full cell phone records - if so then surely that should be a mistrial in itself?) It is plausible that these did not ping off the expected tower because they did not match Jay's story or it is plausible that they did not ping off the expected tower because calls are redirected a lot more than the prosecuting was prepared to admit. The episode is not very clear about why the pings were not used. I'd like to see the original 14 test calls.	20141130T165231
readybrek	2	0	I also think it would be useful to put a bit more detail in Hae's timeline. She spent the first and last period in the same class as Adnan according to Episode 2. Episode 2 She was seen about 2.20pm after last class by Becky and Aisha also confirms she saw Hae talking to Adnan at that time. Episode 9 She was speaking to Summer from about 2.30pm/2.45pm ish for at least 10 minutes in the Gym area. After last bell and after the regular school buses had cleared the loop around school. Episode 9 Debbie Warren says she saw Hae about 3pmish inside the Gym (there must be a police note somewhere about this - I'd like to see the original but it seems SK has!) Episode 2 And finally Inez Butler Hendricks see Hae, no time given but Hae pulls up to buy her usual juice and hot fries before leaving the school apparently on her own. She seems in a hurry because she pulls up and leaves her car running (how long will it take to get to her 3.15pm pickup?) She tells Inez to ask the bus to wait for her despite having told Summer she was going to make her own way to wrestling. edited to add in a missing episode and a correction, Debbie Warren told the cops that she saw Hae inside the school near the Gym.	20141130T175405
WhoKnewWhatWhen	2	0	"This is not really much of a shortcut, if any. I checked google maps at 3pm on a weekday - the time estimate for the routes are 1 minute different. However, it should be noted that there are more left turns on your ""shortcut"". Left turns are generally not what you want if you want to get somewhere fast (see UPS http://compass.ups.com/UPS-driver-avoid-left-turns/) and when assessing alternate routes which have similar expected arrival times, you would do well to choose one with fewer lefts. In addition, the alternate route is a two lane road with residential neighborhoods which could result in more variablility in travel time, particularly if it could be expected to have school bus traffic after school. In any case, the state's best buy timeline has been debunked so there appears to be no reason seek a ""shortcut"" to get them to best buy at a certain time."	20141208T204917

I was impressed that you'd put in this work and from your previous posts I thought you were keen to get to the truth of the matter.

So I had no agenda except explaining the evidence. I thought we had the same agenda even if we don't have the same beliefs but we don't, I think all the evidence is important, you think some can be easily explained away or ignored, so let's move on. I'm impressed with your work and impressed you didn't down vote me even if you thought I was a troll - I think you're a person of integrity but we're not on the same wavelength.

ShrimpChimp	0	0	This theory is the best I've seen for Adnan's guilt. As people are saying, Hae's time at school can probably be based on the assistant Manger's story. Unless Hae had missed another wrestling match since that girl had joined, she remembers arguing with Hae about not being late because she needed help with the scoring, and the she had to manage the scoring on her own because Hae didn't show. I don't see any motive for Adnan to murder Hae, and not Changing his story in 15 years would be remarkable. Why would Jay help is still a hug question. But throw that out and you can walk through your theory with the spine of Jay's story and we know about the day in question.	20141203T012124

readybrek	2	0	Where did you get the idea that Inez felt intimidated? I ask because I read something saying the same on here and they suggested in their post it was mentioned by SK in one of the podcasts after Route Talk. I tried to find their post but the word Inez is too popular for me to be arsed to read them all :-P So I did a search on 'inez' and separately on 'butler' neither word comes up in any later podcast, so then I wondered if it was mentioned before Route Talk and someone had just misremembered. Inez is mentioned in Episode 2 five times - no mention of intimidating, in fact SK actually interviews Inez who just repeats her story of seeing Hae get a drink and leave school in her car on her own. She is also mentioned in episode 5 once - that's just an aside when they pass the gym trying to prove or disprove Adnan's theory that no one could get to Best Buy in 23 minutes. Inez is not mentioned in Episodes 1, 3 or 4 at all. Now there is a reason why some people want to discount Inez' evidence (aside from it being inconvenient to their theory of Adnan's guilt) and that is because she says Hae asked her to make sure the wrestling bus waiting for her. Summer says Hae said she was going to make her own way to wrestling. However this is easily explained by the fact that Hae may have felt bad about Summer being so worried so just changed her mind between talking to Summer and talking to Inez.	20141130T205630
readybrek	1	0	This is what Summer actually says >Summer said this conversation about Hae not getting on the bus happened after the last bell and also after the regular school buses had cleared the loop in front of the school. She said probably at around 2:30, 2:45. Summer says she has no dog in this fight, she’s got no opinions on Adnan’s guilt or innocence. She just knows what she knows. And you are welcome - I like puzzles and the timeline is a huge puzzle.	20141130T203639
readybrek	2	0	The thing is that it's going to be impossible to place Hae's murder - the cops just didn't do enough investigating for that but to make your timeline credible you have to at least find enough time for Adnan or someone else to have murdered her somewhere. Hae being murdered by 2.36pm is made up cops BS. Murdered before 3pm by Adnan looks increasingly unlikely. So what are the other options? Adnan kills her between 3pm and 3.15pm but he has to flag down Hae's car somehow - kill her - hide her body - get to a phone and get Jay to pick him up so they can move the car, there's no come get me call except the one at 3.15pm but that puts too tight a timeline on the mechanics of strangling, hiding her and then finding a phone. Adnan kills her between 3pm and 3.15pm but he has to flag down Hae's car somehow - kill her - hide her body - don't bother phoning Jay and just go to track - get Jay's help after track but that shoots Jay's trial testimony to pieces - why would he lie so extravagantly? Someone else kills her between 3pm and 3.15pm but that person would have to flag her down too! Someone else restrains her between 3pm and 3.15pm but kills her later on. I dunno - we know Hae was murdered and we know she was last seen just past 3pm and she didn't make it to pick up her cousin at 3.15pm but where and when was she murdered?	20141130T202700

You would be more than welcome but I wouldn't hold it against you if you didn't want to either.	20141201T091256
readybrek	2	0	Hmmm, it's a very specific story about Hae leaving her car running - unless she did that every time she stopped then I'd be reluctant to just wave someone's evidence away - if someone did that with evidence against Adnan then you'd rightly call them out on it. Another interesting thing about Inez' account is that SK says Hae buys a juice and hot fries every time but Inez says she stopped by for a drink. Maybe nothing but a change in order and jumping out while your car is still running might underline Hae was in a hurry that day and so make it stick in Inez' mind. If you are really going to discount Inez' account then you need to offer proof as to why you think she was intimidated or else that really eats into your own credibility. You also haven't explained away Debbie Warren who says she saw Hae at 3pm in gym class.	20141130T210912

readybrek	2	0	That's fine but you still have to explain Debbie Warren. So to make your timeline fit we already have to choose the absolute earliest time Summer gives us, we have to wave away Inez' testimony with supposition and no actual evidence and we have to explain Debbie. Ok, so you've done two - now what about Debbie?	20141130T212627
readybrek	1	0	Well I definitely meant the second but I may have been a bit tetchy yesterday because it actually takes a bit of time to remember where I've heard something, track it down and reference it in a post but I never meant to insult you. The thing is, if you post a timeline and all the evidence is in it - if it points to Adnan then it points to Adnan. If it points to Jay then it points to Jay - I don't really care. I am not an Adnan is innocent person - I believe we can't know if Adnan did it if he did it in a different way to the crime he was accused of by the State. Same as we can't know if Jay or someone else did it - not enough evidence any more. Now that crime he was accused of by the State, we know he couldn't have committed because three people see Hae alive after 2.36pm - anyone only has to believe one of those witnesses and the State's case falls apart. Anyhow, I'm running away with myself (again) because of the puzzle aspect, hopefully we're both good now, I know I am and I hope you are too.	20141201T101921
readybrek	3	0	Actually these kids are remembering things from six weeks earlier. It is on police records re Debbie and Inez. In fact the only one remembering things 15 years later is Summer - the one you put most faith in!	20141130T213531
readybrek	5	0	oooohhhh don't suck me.....too late you did :-) Well my initial take on the appellant brief was like yours - why would someone say gym class - that means they were literally taking gym class and that doesn't make sense because we know Hae didn't have gym for her last period. However it is plausible that the meaning is the class that gym is usually held in ie the gym. Could this be a hint that Debbie is remembering the wrong day? Or is it just clumsy wording? It could be either. Also the reference to the time is clumsy - Debbie remembers Hae indicating she would need to rush out somewhere at 3PM - again super ambiguous, is Debbie saying Hae had an appointment for 3PM or is she saying she saw Hae at 3PM? It could be either going on just the typed words. The problem with assuming that Hae has a 3PM appointment is that she is due to pick up her cousin at 3.15pm. How is she going to fit in another appointment beforehand and still make it on time because we know she was speaking to Summer at 2.40pm at the earliest - possibly later. I don't think the defense can just make stuff up. The appellant brief is based on the statement Debbie would have made in court so I don't think it's plausible that the defense made up the time 3PM. I think the defense is more able to act by picking the most favourable times to their timescales - so when talking about Summer they might choose 2.45pm as the starting point of the conversation because it's more favourable to their timeline but they couldn't make up 3PM from nowhere. That's just my opinion though. I think Debbie did see Hae. The wording is open to interpretation so what other evidence is there? Well for a start the cops issued a notice in the paper shortly after Hae had disappeared asking if anyone had seen her. In that notice they say she was last seen at school around 3PM. At this point in time the police have enough confidence in that evidence for them to be comfortable in saying that. Also the timeline of each of the witnesses flows well. 2.20pm - not in a hurry, speaking to Adnan after class. 2.30pm - not in a hurry, speaking to Summer for at least ten minutes 3.00pm - Debbie says in a hurry 3.05pm - (arbitrary time to give Hae time to get to her car) Inez says Hae is in a hurry, she parks in front of the concession stand and leaves her car running. The physical position that each witness puts Hae in flows nicely too - she doesn't jump into an unexpected or unlikely place. 2.20pm outside class 2.30pm in the gym 3.00pm in the gym 3.05pm (arbitrary time) buying a snack on the way out from school. The flow of witnesses is not jarring or contradictory in any way either spatially or temporally so it doesn't seem suspicious or implausible that it happened as everyone says. I'd like to see Debbie's police statement but in the absence then I put weight on the fact the cops were prepared to use the 3PM timeline until it wasn't so convenient for them. The flow of witnesses is more about nothing makes me suspicious about them not fitting together in a logical way. That is why I think that Debbie saw Hae on the day she was murdered is good evidence unless we see something else to the contrary.	20141201T113135
anonymous	9	0	"I'll be as fair and clear as I can. What you need to know first is that it isn't always the case that the phone pings the closest tower. That's because the companies that sell coverage need their towers to be able to toss calls around for all kinds of reasons. Weather is one example. Heavy traffic is another. Cell phones work on radio waves, and if you're like me you've had the experience of trying to tune your radio to a particular station that's far away or doesn't have a strong signal. Sometimes it works great. Other times it's just fuzz. The software that runs cell phone switching is designed to make sure all the calls get held all the time. So, lots of overlap and complex algorithms go into the decision of which tower gets pinged. The territories that the towers cover have to overlap . . . if they didn't, calls would be dropped as phones traveled. The coverage areas are not neat little pieces of pie, as they're often drawn; they're big messy blobs that can change shape under different conditions. So that's the difficulty with saying things like, ""the phone pinged 651A, therefore it was located at x spot."" That just isn't how it works. Cell tower locations are not GPS; they're not even fuzzy GPS. Sometimes a call will ping a tower that's completely unexpected but still within the general area. It won't ever ping a tower that's many miles away. The towers in this case are all within a pretty small radius, which makes it hard to be sure what a particular ping on this one or that one means. There's also the issue of direction. If you look at a cell tower, you see the triangular shaped thing at the top. Each side of that triangle is pointing toward the general area that the tower can pick up calls from. In this case, people have made terrific maps that show the directions in the form of neat little pie shapes, which is kind of misleading but also helpful, because it does matter if a call is getting pinged to a north-facing area or to a south-facing one. My own issue with using those pings as locators for the phone is this: *it's not possible to know how often the closest tower gets pinged.* If we could say, for example, that we have x% certainty, I'd be willing to look at the locations as having x% meaning. But we can't say that, and so my approach is to forget the pings and focus on the calls, their duration, and the various explanations that have been offered for them. The one exception is a super-important one . . . the two calls just after 7 pm that were picked up by a tower sector that serves the southern end of Leakin Park. No one can be certain (except whoever buried Hae Lee), but the combination of (a) that being the most likely time her grave was being dug and (b) that the phone pinged that sector of that tower at that very time seem pretty convincing. It's not 100%. I don't know what % it is. In the podcast, Dana said something like ""I think the phone was in Leakin Park."" That's not really knowable, but she had reason to draw that conclusion. Sorry if this isn't helpful! There's been a ton of posts about it & not much clarity."	20141129T054857

reddit1101	0	0	To me, there is no reason not to deem it as reliable because of the fact that those pings match what most people have said. Cathy can attest to them coming over, the pings are accurate, the towers and time match. That is the case for most of Jay's account (even before the cell records - a point made by SK), Nisha, Jenn, Hae's brother's call, Officer Adcocks' call. There are no real inconsistencies found around the pings. When Adnan finally returns home for the evening, it's accurate about this as well. The tower pings are reliable. There is not a rational reason to think otherwise. my theory http://redd.it/2nnrxx	20141129T171330

This is the reason I made this post in the first place. As far as I'm concerned, all of the other calls from that day don't necessarily indicate Adnan's guilt (even the Nisha one). But these two calls seem to prove that *someone* with Adnan's phone was near the park around the time that the body was probably being buried. And even if the cell phone didn't always ""ping"" to the tower it was closest to, it does seem statistically improbable that it would have pinged to that tower twice in a row if the phone wasn't in/near the park."	20141129T060409

This quote seems was striking: > But numerous experts and telecommunications workers say the FBI analysis techniques are wrong: Cellphone signals do not always use the closest tower when in use but instead are routed by a computerized switching center to the tower that best serves the phone network based on a variety of factors. In addition, the range of cell towers varies greatly, and tower ranges overlap significantly, and the size and shape of a tower’s range shifts constantly, experts say. This is really, really helpful! However, I guess the one question I'd still have is this: is it possible for the ping to be ""wrong"" twice in a row? It seems to me that the one of the most damning pieces of evidence against Adnan so far is that his phone ""pinged"" at/near the park twice that night.

anonymous	1	0	> Or it could be, as Dana said, that the phone was in the park. Oh, I absolutely agree. I see it as perfectly plausible that, given that he'd already lent the phone to Jay earlier, he might do it again. But this does seem to be the part of the day where it makes the *least* sense that he'd lend the phone out, especially since his story doesn't include seeing Jay again after mosque. So, it would be especially helpful for his case if the claim could be made that those pings near the park don't indicate anything significant.	20141129T055928
anonymous	2	0	> his story doesn't include seeing Jay again after mosque I agree with that . . . it does seem like a thing you'd remember, especially after having a while to get your head cleared from the pot.

anonymous	1	0	It seems like he would remember seeing Jay after Mosque (if that happened), because going to mosque would separate he first part of the night (when he was seeing Jay at Cathy's house) from the second part. That being said, much of the answer to this question has to do with what was typical for Adnan. Now, we know that it was common for him to lend Jay his car (and probably his phone) - if that's the case, it might not stick out to him if Jay dropped the car and/or phone off at Adnan's house later that night. Nonetheless, it would definitely be great if we could confirm whether those pings really prove the phone was at/near the park...	20141129T060847
anonymous	3	0	Well, the pings can't prove it. Have you looked at the link where a lawyer walks through every phone call & its tower & what the prosecution, Jay, Jenn, and Adnan said about it?

anonymous	1	0	hmmm, ok, the report says this: > This is very strong evidence that the reason the 7:09 and 7:16 p.m. calls were routed from the Leakin Park tower is that the cell phone was in fact in Leakin Park. The odds are too much against this being a mere coincidence — because over the course of 48 hours, only two calls are routed through L689B, and both occur precisely within the one-and-a-half hour window in which we know the killer was in Leakin Park burying Hae’s body. This is sufficient to establish that the killer had the phone while burying Hae. This is pretty damning stuff! But, as the lawyer points out earlier, why would Adnan say he thought he held onto the car and phone during & after mosque if he was trying to cover things up? tbh one of the things that keeps pulling me towards believing in Adnan's innocence is just the fact that he's done such a piss-poor job of defending himself!	20141129T065922
anonymous	1	0	Another comment - the 10:02 call to Yaser is a perfect example of the fact that the cell phone pings can happen at a tower that isn't closest to the location of the phone.	20141129T071821

anonymous	1	0	true. After reading the post you linked, it seems like the best explanation for everything is that Jay dropped adnan off at mosque, went to bury the body, and then came back to give Adnan the phone and car. But why didn't Adnan remember this? Maybe he was just stoned and hungry and not paying attention? Again, I think we *really* need to know how normal it would have been for Jay to borrow the car and/or phone like that.	20141129T071423

And why, if Jay's story is true, would Jay just be fine with Adnan saying he's going to kill Hae? I can see once he was an accomplice, he would be scared, but BEFORE the murder? If he was afraid of going to the police, afraid that they wouldn't believe him, he could have stopped it by warning Hae. He would have called a friend then and said ""OMG I think Adnan wants to kill Hae, we have to stop this, warn her""....why would he just agree to be an accomplice?"	20141129T054628
anonymous	3	0	It doesn't work. If you are hiring a hitman then you don't lend that hitman your car and phone. You keep as much distance between you as possible and you certainly don't hang out with them all day before and after the hit. Secondly, if Jay was the hitman then he'd also cover his tracks more. He would have alibis and be nowhere near it. Got me thinking though....	20141129T131347

ramyers1	2	0	"Total speculation, but it seems like Jay is kind of a ""gangsta-lite"", not really bad but putting on an act. If Adnan offered to pay Jay to murder someone, would Jay do it, or would he take a share of the money and find someone else? Maybe that was the bigger reason for the loan of the phone and the car, for driving around in the morning to find someone. But for this to work either Jay or Adnan would have to be there during the killing, and the deal would include them disposing of the body. Then with both Jay and Adnan potentially threatened, Jay has lots of lies to spin and can't fully disclose what happened or someone will be after him (or Stephanie) and he will be implicated further, and Adnan can only play the lack of memory card or he will be implicated further. Reading through Jenn's police interview, she describes what could be consistent with Jay feeling that Adnan would screw up and get them both in trouble (saying Adnan was going to get caught, worried about cameras, going back to wipe down of shovels).That seemed less premeditated and more like a late realization of something that was not done right, possibly by someone else."	20141129T173148
TexasLoriG	2	0	Something Adnan said has always nagged at me. Something about the way he said he wanted to talk to Jay on the 13th to ask him if he had gotten Stephanie a gift. It strikes me as something someone would use as a reason/excuse to approach someone they don't know well. I could see this working with your theory if Adnan used this reason to initially approach Jay with the intention of hiring him, and then things went from there. Later, when Adnan was being questioned, maybe it somehow came out even though it was an odd thing to say, and then it became part of the narrative. I have just always thought that was an odd thing to come up.	20141129T061731
Nutbrowndog	3	0	If you read the complete police transcript of Jay's on Rabia's blog it makes some sense. The conversation came up organically--Jay was talking about he and Stephanie's upcoming birthdays and relationships. Adnan went off about Hae, how he'd like to kill her. Jay mentions this twice--two separate interviews. He says he didn't make much of it--didn't take it seriously until Adnan actually started to fabricate a plan. THEN he became worried because he had already agreed to take the car for a pot run. He even mentions telling Jenn he is worried Adnan could be serious this time and Jenn blows it off. Now it makes sense that Jenn would freak out when it really went down--she blew Jay's concerns off so now both of them had foreknowledge. This is why she helped after the fact--she steered Jay wrong, didn't take his fears seriously.	20141129T171919
bigfatgarce	3	0	Well, that's implying you're talking professional hitmen, who don't know each other. Remember, these are kids. I think Adnan thought he was going to have an alibi but no one would corroborate that he was at the library (he tried to talk to people to get them to remember, but....well, you know). He went to track, thinking that everyone would see him there....but no one remembered. Didn't work so well for him.	20141129T171530

If Stephanie was a beautiful girl, and Adnan was a ""player"", why would he go out of his way to call Jay (not a close friend), lend him his car, and lend him the phone?

Planned_Apathy	4	0	I'm not a criminal defense lawyer, but I'm a lawyer who follows criminal cases recreationally. My answer would be that it's never too late to dig around for (and to present) exculpatory evidence. People have been released from death row and life sentences decades after conviction when exculpatory evidenced surfaced or was re-evaluated. And, if any exculpatory evidence comes to the prosecutor's attention before or during the trial, the prosecutor is obligated to present that evidence to the defense (assuming that it didn't come from the defense) and the prosecutor is obligated to consider the evidence in deciding whether to continue with the prosecution. Prosecutors have ethical obligations that go beyond getting convictions whenever and however possible. They must operate fairly and they have an obligation to prosecute only if they believe that probable cause exists, that they can prove every element of the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the defendant is not factually innocent. Of course, prosecutors have been known to violate their own ethical obligations, but this is the standard by which they must be judged.	20141129T055219

JudoChop82	1	0	Maybe Jay was convinced that Adnan was going to murder Hae. But he doesn't want to sound like he knew about the plan beforehand because the cops would then ask him why he didn't stop him or go to the authorities and whatnot. So it's possible that Jay said to the cops that he didn't believe Adnan to try and protect himself further. It seems obvious to me that Jay and Jen are both not being wholly truthful about the entire incident.	20141129T100355
Stumpytailed	1	0	"Jenn said Jay was nervous/hyper, and she also says that he was ""waiting for a call"" to come in around 3:30. She was very clear, he was waiting for a call, the phone was sitting out on the coffee table, and said he got at least 2 calls (from her transcripts). To me this implies that Jay was waiting on call ""to assist"" Adnan in some way and thus premeditation. A lot of people here have swung to ""crime of passion"" in the past weeks as most likely (myself included), but this story clearly implies otherwise. Jenn's timing of the calls is another issue: is she lying about the 3:30 time to provide Jay with an alibi by moving the time forward? Or is she accurately remembering that Jay expected the call ""about 3:30"" and thus generalized that this is in fact the time they came in, or thereabouts? (where as the cell records show that they came in earlier, around 2:36)."	20141129T143908

Your question makes me wonder, what if Hae wasn't going to confront Jay about his infidelity, but had already done so and warned him that she is about to tell Stephanie?

anonymous	1	0	He has been told that it's going to happen, it's real and the moment to stand up is now.

cuteseal	2	0	Thanks for bringing this theory forward. I've got a similar theory on the mechanics, not so much the motive - in that Adnan hired/coerced Jay to kill Hae. Jay kills her and buries the body. Then pins it on Adnan when the cops get too hot on his trail. Kind of explains how Adnan can maintain his innocence about not knowing the details. But I think he is just as guilty as Jay is.	20141129T105319

anonymous	1	0	"That's what gets me. According to the timeline the cops pulled Adnan's phone records, saw a bunch of calls to Jenn and went to her house to talk to her. Day 1: Cops go to Jenn. Jenn talks to Jay. She told them she couldn't talk to them and she'd come down the next day. She herself admits that she went to talk to Jay. According to her Jay said ""Yeah, tell the cops about me...send them to me,"" and that's what she did THE NEXT DAY with her mother and a lawyer (which if the lawyer is worth his/her salt I'm sure she was couched as to what she should reveal and on language to use). Day 2: Jenn goes to cops with lawyer and mother. Tells them about Jay. It isn't until the next day after Jenn talks to the cops that they go to get Jay. He had part of day 1, all of day 2 to do something. My theory is that he used that time to move Hae's car (to across from where Hae's body was discovered, I believe this was mentioned in the car's location). The cops had the license plate number, the make and model and colour of the car! They would have been checking in that area for anything that looked remotely like it. That car gave Jay power and credibility in talking to the cops about what he knew/saw/did."	20141129T071000

It would be way too risky to try to put up an intentionally false narrative at the beginning of a homicide investigation like that for an objective lawyer to think it was a good idea. Now, I'm not saying Jenn told the truth. I am saying she didn't sit down with her lawyer and say ""well, I'm an accomplice, help me come up with a story where I'm just an accessory after the fact.""

Especially since in at least one of Jay's accounts, they leave the house together. I have to at least put on the table the idea of a thrill-killing, like one that occurred in NH in 2001 and was carried out by a 16-yr-old and 17-yr-old (Parker & Tulloch, lots of info available). Tulloch and Parker were a really bad mix...volatile, thrill-seeking, with Tulloch allegedly the more assertive, and sociopathic. This type of crime can be difficult to solve because investigators focus on a motive that ""normal"" people would have. In the case I mentioned, the focus on motive led them down several false paths. Not saying anything specific here about the brother, just that I do wonder about the nature of the friendship, and why there's no information, considering he was with Jay on that day (of course, there's probably a lot in this case that we outsiders don't get to access)."	20141230T004555

lavacake23	5	0	Yes, and Jay also maintains that Adnan did it. You could say that it's also psychologically improbable that he would still maintain Adnan's guilt, if he had been duped by the cops. You know how come people who confessed falsely are let out of prison? Because the person who does it usually comes forward. In the case that Deirdre talked about, that guy was saved from death row because that other guy admitted that her client didn't do it. Same with the Central Park Five. No one has stepped forward and said that Jay has confessed. You have to apply those same principles to him. What's fair is fair. Also, this idea that Adnan would HAVE to be a psychopath to have committed the murder and maintain his innocence is a bit of an exaggeration.

If he admits guilt then he has 0 chance of being exonerated for any reason. Regardless of whether he did it, he knows the case against him was weak and his only hope at being freed lies with proving he had incompetent representation. Hence his desire for Sarah to find fault with the way his case was handled. Edited to Add: I am not a psychologist, but I don't think he would need to be a psychopath to realize that in order for him to ever have a possibility of being let out, he can never admit guilt.	20141129T203758
ackdoc	6	0	"There's an interesting concept that is written about called the Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent_prisoner's_dilemma) It's when a factually innocent prisoner has to face the catch-22 dilemma of lying and confessing guilt in order to appease the parole board, knowing that doing so will change everyone's perception of him/her once out and prevent any further investigation to prove innocence. I am wondering how this concept could explain Adnan's behavior and maintained innocence. He has a life sentence (+) and no chance of parole. Rabin (and now SK) are, therefore, his parole board. If they succeed in turning his case around, he walks. Could it be that Rabia's investment and motivation over the years has created the reverse of the Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma for Adnan? Knowing that his only possibility of release relies on her interest and efforts is a strong motivation to maintain innocence, to say exactly what this ""parole board"" wants to hear, whether or not it is true."	20141129T141810

If he has a conscience and isn't a psychopath (or high in those traits), then I would think it's unusual for him to keep it quiet so long. But if he is a psychopath (or high in those traits) then I think it's absolutely possible and *probable* that he would be able to. So it's a wash.	20141129T201701

birdsofterrordise	3	0	"I would be interested in hearing the data points for a criminal's profession of innocence or confession of guilt based on the similar ages to Adnan. If he committed the crime he was in high school (18, but mentally, still a high schooler) and then aged a decade or so, how that would change the psychological characterization? Versus someone who commits a murder as a young adult, post high school and then a decade after that. From personal experience working with high schoolers and seeing them years later, I often hear the same line ""sorry about being a jerk in high school"" or ""sorry about that time I did x or did y- I was a stupid kid then"". The psychological changes are much more pronounced going from HS to the adultworld. I am not saying it would necessarily flip (meaning he said he was innocent and now he is ""mature"" enough to say he did) but I don't know if he could be so adamant about not knowing what went down, continually, over time. I think he would have developed some alternative motive, pinning, narrative at this point. Instead, he is replaying pretty much what he think he did that day. I found this point interesting - (paraphrasing) that an innocent person really doesn't know or remember anything and they weren't thinking about an alibi or a story because they didn't do it. When kids and teens do things they aren't supposed, there almost always is a story (god, even calling out a kid for talking in class and you get a whole explanation as to why they were doing what they were not supposed to be doing), but make a mistake and call a kid for doing something they actually were not doing, they just look dumbfounded and don't even know what to say because they just didn't develop an excuse. Sure, talking in the back of the room during a test isn't the same as murder, but I wonder if the psychological pathways for justification and reasoning to others occur on the same interface."	20141129T145417

And that innocence is reflected in the way he talks about the crime. I don't know whether adnan is guilty or not. There are huge pieces of this puzzle missing.

After SK makes her statement, Adnan gets frustrated and says something along the lines of: ""I am so tired of hearing people SAY that, I want someone to PROVE that I didn't do it."" To me it feels like this speaks more of his innocence than anything else (well not innocence, I think he knows more than he is admitting). He doesn't want to prove he's too nice to have murdered someone, he wants to be found innocent of the crime of killing someone. If he were guilty but trying to come off as too nice to have done it, he's accomplished it and would not have reacted with such frustration."	20141129T093213

The DNA evidence didn't leave room for doubt. He maintained his innocence, and I imagine he will stick to that story until he dies of old age while living on death row.

Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because ""prospects of losing at trial were very good.""[205] Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a ""tactical move"": He could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost, and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal.[206][207] At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal.

twoforthejack	1	0	As I've tried to sum up, my point about Adnan is not solely about protested guilt/maintaining innocence. I am referring more generally to the character, perspective and worldview of innocent men and Adnan strikes me as someone who has some really similar sociological traits to this cohort. Look, what an inmate says to his lawyer, judge or reporter may be very different from how he speaks with guys inside prison. So I'm curious how Adnan speaks with other inmates and what he shared with those he may have become close to. My point is that actively, consciously maintaining innocence AND optimism (or lack of anger/resentment) seem to be characteristics of wrongfully convicted men. This notion that this can be affected, or acted I find very hard to believe. Of course this is not scientific. But I am noting that it would be interesting to talk to exonerated men about their cognitive or emotional world while incarcerated. Whether it's the Central Park Five, Michael Mosley, or others there is a certain bedrock peace that these men seem to carry within themselves.	20141129T154626

joshuarion	15	0	"I think that most people agree that for Adnan to be guilty, he'd have to have a pretty serious personality disorder... Something like psychopathy. Maintaining his innocence with a personality disorder is very different than with neuro-typical inmates. One of the few facts we know is that Jay knew inside information about the crime (discounting super-unlikely mega-conspiracy-cop-corruption theories). That basically leaves Adnan, Jay or Adnan *and* Jay as committing the crimes, right? I'm not saying Adnan is guilty, but I think one thing most people agree with here is that something is *off* about this case. I keep going back to [The Umbrella Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yznRGS9f-jI) and Sarah's own words: all of this is spin for whatever side is saying it. Chris' story about Jay trying to stab him sounds **psychotic** if read, but if you listen to him tell it, he's laughing about it. Joking. To him, it seemed like it was a case of ""we did stupid shit, we were young boys, you know?"". Every. Single. Fact of this case can be used by either side. It's crazy. Adnan being so calm about all of this can be a symptom of his ""disconnection of reality because of his sociopathy"" *or* his peace because of his religion. Two things we know for sure: Adnan knows if he killed Hae. Jay knows why he testified the way he did. Almost everything else is speculation and conjecture. I don't know.

birdsofterrordise	8	0	"If he was a psychopath or sociopath, there would be a fuck lot more of stories about his lack of empathy, but also, he would most certainly have behavioral problems in school, since generally socio-psychopathy need a lot more stimulation- which traditional school does not usually provide. His school records (and previous criminal record) do not indicate any of that. I have only encountered one child that was on the cusp of the diagnosis- he was diagnosed with ODD and a personality disorder, but the school psychologist recommended him for more tests and intensive treatment outside of what the school can provide. We practiced what was called ""cognitive empathy"" for students like that and students with autism who struggle with social cues for empathy. The difference is, the kids with autism may feel it, just not understand the social ways of expressing it when and appropriately, whereas the kids who are callous-unemotional don't feel any emotional response, so have to learn the whole social game of identifying and learning what a proper response is (CU- which is more of the 'accepted' term for diagnosing a child with socio or psychopathy.) I am not jealous of anyone who does that work full time (I only subbed for a few days.) This [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/can-you-call-a-9-year-old-a-psychopath.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) goes into a great deal more about what it is like to deal with a child with psychopathy. When you hear other people speak of Adnan and Hae's own entries, you don't hear the C-U symptoms. And from speaking with friends who work in special education and other teachers listening to Serial, we all agree, a teacher at some point, at some time would have flagged him for something. Especially because by the 90s, special education and referring became a much greater practice--this isn't the 60s and 70s where a lot of shit was left to fly under the radar."	20141129T151411

fpmhnp	3	0	YES, YES, YES. From what we know of Adnan's functioning within his community, school, and family, he does not exhibit any of the traits or symptoms necessary for a diagnosis of anything on the oppositional defiant/conduct disorder/antisocial continuum. (I recognize that we don't know everything about his functioning, but SK's omission of any C-U traits would be enormously unfair.) Experimenting with drugs and girls and lying to one's parents is, quite simply, completely developmentally appropriate for a teenager.	20141129T154147
anonymous	1	0	What is 'normal'? I am saying it is possible Adnan is not a psychopath even if guilty. Some people here seem to suggest the two things follow. I don't think they do.	20141129T224739
birdsofterrordise	2	0	Yes exactly. If SK leaves out a bunch of details about that- it would be unfair. Also, it is so much more likely for a minority student to get identified- as there is a huge over-representation of minority students in special education and behavioral referrals. It is 100% developmentally appropriate for a teen, what you said above. So is breaking up and getting back together. Totally normal. Wanting to get back with a girl and she moved on from your flip-flop relationship? Normal. He was into other girls as well, which leads me to think too that it is even less of a crime of passion. It isn't like he had some lack of friends and family and she was his only connection to the real world.	20141129T155027

JudoChop82	2	0	Regarding the butt dial, it is possible that the phone rang for 2 minutes and 22 seconds. Whoever had the phone accidentally calls Nisha's number. Nisha is not present, and she does not have an answering machine. The phone continues to ring unbeknownst to the caller. When the caller realizes the accidental call he/she hangs up with no one having answered the call on the other end. Just another possibility.	20141129T095713

bitofastate	1	0	You're forgetting that the durations are ring to hang and not pick up to hang. Cell charging was different in 99 than it is now. So a call is made by someone unfamiliar with speed dial on a cellphone, remember Jay doesn't have one so forgets to lock it, and they don't realize for 2:22. What we don't know is if the network had a maximum ring duration and then just cut off. Butt dials were way more common on older phones than now, mainly down to how speed dial worked. Truth is all we know is that the call was made, everything else is speculation. The issue is why is it out of pattern with the preceding and subsequent calls until the voicemail pick up at 5:14?	20141129T102341
anonymous	1	0	From what I have read in [this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2ksrtj/what_make_and_model_phone_did_adnan_have/), Adnan had a [Nokia 6160](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6110), which is a member of the 6110 model family. Don't be so quick to dismiss the butt-dial. The candy bar phones were popular. For early adopters (people who got cell phones from 1999 to say 2002), a lot of people had a Nokia. I myself had the Nokia 5110. Butt dials just happened. They happened a lot. I had a friend named Alec who happened to be the first entry in our circle of friends' address book. He was the recipient of most of our collective butt dials. While the clam shell design had been around for a long time (the Motorola StarTac phone comes to mind), it became wildly popular in 2004 with the release of the Moto RAZR. Over the next couple of years, a lot of phones moved to the clam shell, which had the advantage of virtually eliminating the butt-dial. When the iPhone came out in 2007, the candy bar design began to come back. With the elimination of a physical keypad, butt dials are rare (but somehow still does happen). You're quick to dismiss the butt-dial. But being from Generation X and was an early adopter of the cell, I can personally attest to the fact that butt-dials happened, and they happened a lot. Note: I'm still unsure about the Nisha call. I'm of the mindset that Adnan is probably guilty. But I'm at a loss to explain the Nisha call. But these don't overcome my gut feel that Adnan probably did it.	20141129T133929
Hopper80	0	0	An accidental dialing to Nisha's home, where no-one was around to answer it and it rang and rang until either phone company automatically cut it off. That's my guess. Never mind speed dial and such - my last mobile phone (made circa 2009-10) had one button to bring up the 'recent calls' list, and the same button to dial that number. I always had the phone in a shirt or jacket pocket. I had quite a few unintended calls until I made a habit of using the 'lock' function. A shift in how I'm sitting, or a fast enough walking pace such that the phone could bump against something else in my pocket, and I'm pissing away my credit just so the last person I spoke to can be confused for a bit. But: did the cops ask others in Nisha's household if they'd picked up a call that afternoon, be it from Adnan or Jay or someone's pocket, or if anyone was actually home then? Did they bother to look at later phone records, seeing if there was a call to Nisha that pinged by Jay's work, and was made at a time it's confirmed Jay was at work?	20141129T113639
anonymous	3	0	"If a call wasn't completed, I don't think it would have shown up on a billing statement. It's been 15 years since I've seen my phone records from back in 1999, but I would be very, very surprised if an uncompleted call was billed, even if the phone rang for over 2 minutes. I'm trying to remember the transition happened, but this was during the time when PCS technology first came to prominence. PCS was digital, and while digital cell phone technology is now the norm, back then, digital was in competition with analog cell technology. PCS, such as Adnan's Nokia 6160, often had perks such as: voice mail, caller ID, call waiting, etc. At least in my area, PCS had a promotion of ""first minute of every incoming call was free."" We had a lot of conversations that lasted less than 1 minute."	20141129T135426
JackTrigger	2	0	I do not believe phone calls register a duration unless someone picks up on the other end. At least that's how my current iphone works - the duration does not begin until someone picks up on the other end, or until it goes to voicemail.	20141129T165350
anonymous	0	0	As I mentioned up above, I don't recall cell phones charging for calls that were never completed. Yes, air time was used to place a call, but unless the call was picked up on the other end, I don't recall my bill being charged. What I do find odd is that in 1999, who didn't have an answering machine or voice mail? These things were spotty in the mid to late 80s. But by 1999? I found it odd that Nisha didn't have some sort of answering device.	20141129T140525

I understand that the circumstances were out of the norm, but still, why that little detail? Why remember that? Edit- another one that popped out at me was what Hae was wearing, he says she has on a white shirt, black skirt and tan or beige (?) tights, like pantyhose? What guy would notice that? He saw her for a brief minute in the trunk and then when he helps bury her, in the dark!"	20141129T133646

bluueit12	4	0	Actually, I've read that a person giving too much detail is a sure sign that they're lying. People that lie try too hard to convince you that they're telling the truth so they over compensate. They have an answer for *everything* even when it's something a person would not normally notice. They also have an inability to tell the story from different points in time....like, backwards or from the middle, then to the end then to the beginning. It's usually the person that can tell the story backwards, forwards from the middle but can't tell you the exact location of the sun in the sky (for example) that is being truthful.	20141129T183322
westies121	5	0	"My immediate thought when listening to Jay's narrative is that he is able to give a high level of detail because he is describing what he actually did - only he says Adnan did it. That is, he is a very good liar and understands that the best lies are very close to the truth. So Jay's solution is just to describe what he did and then adjust it to fit Adnan's situation. He had a whole month to come up with this - to prepare for questions, to probe his story. His responses sometimes just seem too quick. Like when the police ask him why Adnan went to him and he says very quickly, ""I'm the criminal element of Woodlawn."" Is that how you would respond to an impromptu question like that in a police interrogation room? Would you be able to conceptualize that quickly? Or when he says he lied about the location of the murder because he was concerned about the fact video cameras could have recorded Adnan and that ""he's associated."" His answers are just too quick and too conceptually thought-out, but they also don't really ring true. I think Adnan is intellectually quite bright but is not discerning when it comes to people. He's in a supermax prison but has a breakfast club with other prisoners? He makes supermax sound like...The Breakfast Club. He's chumming around with people who must have done horrific things to others. He's easily adaptable and I think he can overlook disturbing qualities in others because he is a genuinely friendly, ""glass is half full"" kind of guy. It's not that weird because it's all he knows and my guess is that he's emotionally frozen at 18."	20141129T191736
RawbHaze	4	0	I agree with you. However, I find the counting change comment funny if taken literally. Grab a bowl full of mixed change. Sit in a completely dark room. Grab a handful of change and count it. Turn a light on and count it again. Highly likely that you were accurate. Quarters and nickels can easily be identified. Dimes slightly differ from cents in weight and diameter but their edges are the easiest way to tell 'em apart.	20141129T090858
BranSerial	3	0	Did anyone notice from the transcripts how consistently and dramatically Jay inflates time estimates? The 4.5 minute call with police is 15 or 20 minutes. 2 minute calls are 7 or 8. It's like he's living in a third-level inception dream (or very close to a black hole). To me, this really undermines anything Jay says about time.	20141129T120820
anonymous	2	0	Jay insisting on Adnan wearing red gloves.

Hopper80	2	0	It's weird, but at the same time, a mind under stress will do weird things. It may focus on details so as to avoid considering the big picture. God knows mine does. At best, Jay at that moment is someone who knew of an upcoming murder, has let it happen without intervention, having agreed to help with the disposal of the body, and is presently doing so. At worst, the gloves are on his own hands and, having just strangled an acquaintence to death, he may have cause to consider his red-gloved hands such that the details lodge in his memory.	20141129T191759

This was mentioned in episode 8 I think? The three hours where the ""truth is"" or something. Perhaps during this prepping is when he was able to brandish so many of his ""lustrous"" descriptions of himself, the situation, etc etc. If you read the transcription of his first interview its clearly apparent they did this because the cop says things like ""and where is that again?"" as if they had already asking him about this. You would think if they had to hear Jay clarify a location, on first chance they would say something like ""to be specific where is this location you are talking about?"" not just the casual ""and where is that again?"".

The lack of leaves lets the moonlight in, and if there's snow it reflects the light all around and creates a high-contrast backdrop to see things against.

So later Jay had also gotten Jenn involved as has to lie about timelines so as not to implicate her as having foreknowledge, since neither really believed it would happen. Makes sense.	20141129T164852
whydontyouaskher	4	0	"Plus, didn't he say that when he pulled up and saw Adnan standing there wearing the red gloves, he was like ""why the fuck are you wearing those gloves?"" That implies that he noticed them because Adnan normally wouldn't wear something like that. Reminds me of the cardboard box my parents kept in the hallway closet where they'd store all kinds of random winter items for the family to use. This is stuff my parents picked out or bought on sale, so if I wore any of it my friends would notice because it wasn't like me to wear a garish Canadian flag toque or whatever."	20141129T160618

westies121	1	0	"This is really interesting. I now I want to go over all of the different versions over the holiday break. It makes sense to me that they would prep him first and record it. The thing about Jay's transcript that stood out, though, were things that seemed vividly real - like his description of Adnan telling him how Hae died. It just seemed so real and I could see him using his own experience and then just transposing it to Adnan. I got the sense from his transcript that because it hadn't happened in the way he was telling it, that he was ""anchoring"" himself in real details (from his own experience killing Hae)."	20141207T034621

If it feels like powder and has a thin face then it's a $1. If it feels like powder and has a fat face then it's a $10. If it feels like a hard wood then it's $20.

EnsignCrunch	3	0	Even when you're not high. I've often found myself annoyed at waiting for 10 minutes, only to look at a clock and discover it's only been 5. Adnan shows an example of this when he describes how long it took the buses to let out after school. Of course to him it seemed like forever, but when SK actually times it it's not that long (granted things could have changed in the interim). Out of all the inconsistencies in Jay's story/stories, the little timing discrepancies are the least worrying (to me, anyway).	20141129T173238
BranSerial	1	0	Where did I say anything about Adnan? And where did I say that we can't trust anything Jay says? You seem to be assuming that I fall into a given faction based on one observation about a witness's statements.	20141129T181802
BranSerial	1	0	And he does it in ways that clearly aren't self-serving: obviously, he knows the police have the call logs and know exactly how long the police/Nisha/Patrick/etc calls are. And yet he's still way off about their lengths and times. This at once suggests to me that the details of his account aren't very reliable, but also that (at least some of) the inconsistencies/impossibilities may be attributable to his flawed memory and computational ability and not to malice or calculation. But I don't think this could explain the big stuff, like the ever-shifting location of the trunk pop.	20141129T143403
ReaderThinker	10	0	"Before I was leaning towards Jay's testimony being coerced. But as I slowly read thru his two police interviews, I'm sorry to say, the story did seem pretty darn ""consistently, consistent."" Yes, there were discrepancies, but I can understand him lying during the first interview to leave out Cathy and Jeff (to not involve them), maybe lying to leave out some drug dealing meetings and lying to friends about the murder location later because he wanted to get it off his chest, but also didn't want to give miscellaneous people too many details that might lead to DNA evidence findings if they snitched. Not knowing the exact times of calls or the times of calls changing during each interview is understandable. I tested myself the other night by trying to recall the time of every Thanksgiving call I made and received and the order of my calls. 24 hours after making/receiving these calls, my memory was already faulty. I was off sometimes by 30 minutes or so and really had to ""think hard"" to remember. Recalling call times and your exact movements in the correct sequence on any given day is difficult. Test yourselves and you will see. I still have to analyze Jay's interviews more, but right now I'm 50/50."	20141129T180728
EsperStormblade	1	0	"Yeah, I agree. I mean in the first interview he's asked what time Adnan calls him the AM on the 13th. He nails it and says around 10:45. In the second one, he says, 11, 11:15, 11:30. LOL. And yes, when he describes how long the call with Adcock is, I believe he says it's about 10 minutes long when in actuality it's about 4 or 5. So his sense of time is totally fucked. I think for Jay time is like this: morning, afternoon, night. That's about it. As for changing the location of the trunk pop, I can even imagine if he is TOTALLY HIGH, like high beyond belief (in fact, I can't believe how much he claims to have smoked in one day and he's still functioning...by his own account he smoked at least 2 blunts and several more times throughout the day he smoked up, amount/type unspecified) what if he literally doesn't remember...he's like, ""it was in a parking lot somewhere..."""	20141129T144618
Nutbrowndog	4	0	It's easy for me to see how Jay got drawn in...the statements ring painfully true and are heartbreaking in their detail. The story makes sense especially if you take it at face value that Jay didn't buy it at first, but Adnan kept saying it and then it became a plan, at which point he alerts Jenn who only confirms what Jay hopes--that it's just talk. Jay's just happy to have the car and score some dope. Ouch. If that's true then Jay and Jenn must have freaked out when it really happened.	20141129T183057

whydontyouaskher	5	0	True. But Hae was also described as wearing a skirt and stockings (her field hockey outfit?) so maybe it wasn't that cold. I'm the same age as Adnan and I also remember that back then a lot of teenagers, especially guys, didn't wear gloves, mittens, or winter accessories. People would wear those big ski jackets and just shove their hands in their pockets and freeze. They thought that looked cooler. Just speculating, obviously, but I can see him thinking it was unusual...	20141129T173931

She told her dad right away, and he called the cops right away. And, I talked to friends of Jay’s who also knew The Neighbor Boy, and they said, “oh that guy?” They gave the impression The Neighbor Boy was a bit of a gossip. A guy untalented at keeping secrets. Which, could play either way I guess. But they meant it like, “nobody would tell him anything they wanted to stay quiet.” The Neighbor Boy never shows up at trial. He is never mentioned. So, I let it go. But, you know, it is weird. And if Laura’s story is true, then there’s another witness to this murder.

scottious	8	0	> Can it simply be that Adnan's hanging out just for the pot, so is friendly but not a friend From personal experience... absolutely! One's relationship with their weed dealer can be weird. You both share a common interest and they're the person you can get it from easily. It's certainly within one's best interest to be friendly, nice, and do favors for your weed dealer. I gave my dealer a digital piano I didn't need anymore (which I could have sold for at least $100) just as a gesture (and also as a thank you for letting me smoke for free). I was never really friends with my weed dealer because we actually had almost nothing in common past weed, and when I stopped smoking we pretty much stopped hanging out together.	20141129T135106
glamorousglue	2	0	One thing thats always bugged me is why you'd loan anyone, let alone an accquaintance-your car and brand new cell phone. However, as time as gone on, I can see how a high school dope smoker might loan those items to his dope dealer for dope.	20141129T173417

sprawn	3	0	The going notion is that in 1999 a High School student could certainly not take his cellphone into school with him. Therefore, Adnan left the cellphone in the car.

sprawn	17	0	They just brush this off on the podcast. They dig down into individual phone calls but completely overlook the general traffic analysis. Finding out what the record shows on Hae's pager in the weeks and months leading up to her death, and the days after her death is very important. The podcast just shrugs this off like it's no big deal. If he was calling her many, many times a day prior to her disappearance and then stopped completely when she did disappear, this suggests (as you point out) that he knew there was no point in calling her pager. It could also demonstrate that he was controlling or even obsessive.	20141129T122511
anonymous	9	0	"As to your first point: I don't like how easily Adnan dismissed not calling Hae. I mean, let's look at the facts. Hae went missing on the afternoon of Wednesday the 13th. A snow storm hits, keeping kids out of school until the following Tuesday (with Monday having been MLK Day). For those 6 days, we are to believe that Adnan just stopped reaching out to Hae altogether. I think we know that Adnan was calling & paging Hae on a regular basis. Then, after the 13th, the calls & pages just stopped. ""Oh, I was with friends when they tried calling her, etc."" just doesn't cut it with me. Something about that statement just rang false with me. In fact, he seemed very nonchalant about not contacting Hae. This doesn't help Adnan look good at all."	20141129T142526

Hopper80	2	0	As noted, he didn't get the phone til the evening before. He called her on the first night he had his new phone to give her the number - which makes sense. How often they spoke on the phone before this would be very helpful to know. I do wish there was much more data to cross check and contextualise, to pin down who was where when, who called who when - before and after phone records from Adnan, call logs from phones of others involved and around the case. With so little data, what seems plausible to the individual is mostly a matter of experience, perspective and framing.	20141129T145924
Befozz	2	0	For me this is also one of biggest indicators that Adnan may have known she was dead, if the police called me looking for someone I knew, let alone dated, the next thing I would do is call them. Adnan says he didn't take this call from the police to mean Hae was missing, he thought she was just in trouble, but if this was the case I would be even more inclined to call my friend and let them know they should get their ass home because they're gonna be in big trouble.	20141129T173221
whitenoise2323	2	0	Adnan said he didn't remember if he did or didn't try to page Hae after she went missing. It's possible he tried from his home phone or a different phone.

steve_yo	-2	0	Here is an alternate theory... or speculation; if you killed someone and needed to cover your tracks, wouldn't you go out of your way to pretend you are innocent? In other words, why wouldn't Adnan call/page Hae like crazy those first days if he was pretending to be innocent? One explanation is that he is innocent and he knew everyone around him was doing it. In a way, his lack of calling/paging makes me believe him more rather than less.	20141129T142102

DumbMattress	8	0	If you're going to argue that a lack of calls to Hae's number after she disappeared is incriminating though, you could equally argue that considering how aware Adnan was of how his cell phone could be used as evidence (hence giving to Jay etc), then surely he'd have thought to attempt to call/page her in order to maintain a consistent narrative with the police. On the other hand, if you believe he didn't murder her or was aware of her murder, then it is quite conceivable that when everyone in your social circle is discussing how Hae isn't picking up her phone for anyone, then why would Adnan think he'd be an exception? Some may not consider it normal that he'd view it as a waste of the time paging her, but that's projecting and doesn't mean he's guilty.	20141129T162827
cuteseal	4	0	Yep for me this was the biggest factor in leading me to believe he is either guilty or involved or having knowledge of her death.	20141129T143732
WWBlondieDo	1	0	We're never going to have these questions answered without Adnan and Hae's home phone records showing the frequency of his calls to her prior to January 13th - his lack of calls to her over that weekend may not have been at all unusual. Also remember that, at that time, none of Hae's friends were taking her disappearance seriously. If he truly had no knowledge of her murder and she didn't respond to his page that weekend, it may not have occurred to him to continue to try to get a hold of her - he could have just thought that she was busy or ignoring him for some reason. Alternatively, with school being out for so many days, the lack of calls from Adnan's cell phone to Hae's pager or home phone doesn't necessarily mean that Adnan didn't try to call her those days, just that he didn't call from his cell phone. It is completely possible that he called or paged her from his home phone during those days. Remember, cell phones didn't have unlimited minutes and weren't attached to people's hands in those days - if you were home, why would you not use your home phone to make a call? I got my first cell phone, a Nokia with changeable face plates, in 1999 when I was 16 and I used my home phone whenever I was home and it was available. It would never have occurred to me to use my cell phone at those times and I didn't even pay for the minutes myself, my parents did. If I had to spend my money on those minutes, you can bet that I would have used any other available phone to make calls whenever it was humanly possible. TL;DR - it is possible that Adnan wasn't in the habit of calling Hae daily anymore and so his lack of calls that weekend weren't outside of his normal behavior AND/OR Adnan used a home phone to call Hae on those days they were out of school.	20141130T194420
PopcornCowgirl	1	0	I agree with everything you've said, but want to throw this out there: in episode 9, we're told that when Adnan finds out Hae is missing/dead (sorry, I listened to it a week ago and can't remember exactly) he called the detective. SK said this action struck her as those of a concerned friend.	20141129T165819
EarthCatcher	1	0	Yeah this is exactly what I was thinking. We don't have any information on the pagers so we can not speculate on how much he would have been paging her.	20141130T015245
handytemp	0	0	I don't think so. She had a pager. He wouldn't phone the home phone, obviously, you're right. I guess he could have called her pager, but I can see why, if he was around people who were already doing that, he might not bother.	20141129T180418

cuteseal	1	0	Agreed. Through all the conjecture, shifting statements, and heresay of this case, the only thing that stands absolutely firm is the cell phone records. Pity there weren't more records to build upon.	20141129T235750
joppy77	2	0	"Whenever I go over that scenario in my head, all I can think is that if I had a friend who had recently broken up with a longterm girlfriend who he was still regularly talking to on the phone, and then she went legit missing, I'd find it really weird if he didn't even try to call her. I think I'd be weirded out if I asked him about trying to call her, and he said something like, ""I haven't... everyone else is trying, so there's really no point."" It takes a couple seconds to make a phone call. And if you've just been dating someone for over a year, there should be a natural drive to at least try. You never know who she might decide to answer the phone for, especially in a run away situation. I don't know... to me, that just isn't the kind of behavior that is explained away with the ""everyone reacts differently"" reasoning. Some behaviors are so consistent and predictable within certain circumstances that deviation from them is a red flag at the very least. Now obviously if he called from some other phone and ""doesn't remember,"" well that leaves a perfect amount of wiggle room for doubt that he didn't call. So there's not much to say about that, except that it seems most likely that he would call from his own phone, especially given that he had just given her the number to it right before she disappeared (and therefore she would recognize it or have it labelled with his name)."	20141130T025607
temp4adhd	1	0	Probably Wal Mart. In Jay's second transcript, he says he and Adnan walked over to the Wal-Mart across the street from Jay's house to go shopping on Jan 12, which was Jay's birthday.	20141129T232955
sprawn	15	0	"The things that make a good story, are often seen as the best evidence. And they are often the worst evidence. Things that are seen as boring, or are *not even noticed* because they are so mundane are often brushed aside. And in trials, almost all evidence that is ever presented will be pseudoscientific garbage and character assassination. We are experiencing selected evidence and SK is the selector. I am appreciative that she brought in that professional in the last two episodes. I forget his name. He at least brings up the things that SK brushes aside. For instance, people think that they have perfect tape recorder memories. So they think that ""telling the truth"" is a simple matter of telling the truth. And they think that ""telling the truth"" will result in a person telling the *exact same story* every time they are asked about a situation. Therefore, if details differ between retellings, the teller of the story is ""lying."" And a ""liar"" is not to be trusted on matters of fact. Jay told two different stories. Jay is a liar. Discard everything Jay says. This is just horrendous hogwash. The first thing is that personal testimony is the worst evidence. The second thing is that people forget things, people remember things incorrectly, people give different answers depending on how a question is asked. People are not magical VCRs with perfect memory cameras. But people think that they are and that other people are."	20141129T132428

MisoSoup	2	0	It could be argued that a concerned friend would totally try to contact that friend if she was missing. Calling the police might be interpeted as a cynical attempt to mask his guilt. (I'm not saying he is guilty, just that we can interpret things differently.)	20141129T220100

Maybe its because I'm still a noob in this subreddit, or maybe because I'm inserting my own recollection as to how technology worked in 1999…or maybe because I believe Adnan is guilty. I will still contribute, though.	20141129T150352

whitenoise2323	1	0	I agree with most of what you're saying here... just a couple of details. Seems trifling to bring up but.. Adnan and Hae dated for 7 months for whatever that's worth. Also, she had just fallen head over heels for Don. She called him her soulmate in her diary. I can understand giving someone that you care about space in a moment like that.

Especially this: > Interestingly, Jim Trainum, the former homicide detective we hired to review the investigation, immediately disregarded every single statement about Adnan’s reaction. In terms of evaluating someone’s guilt, he said, stuff like that is worthless. He advised me to do the same, just toss it all out he said, because it’s subjective, it’s hindsight, and also, people tend to bend their memories to what they think police think they want to hear.

pennyparade	2	0	100% agree.	20141130T011301
anonymous	2	0	We *do* know how Adnan and Hae contacted each other in homes where dating was forbidden. One would page the other person. Then, the other person would dial the time or the weather and stay on the line for the call waiting signal and then switch over to the incoming call. So, the fact that we know this as it was covered in the podcasts makes at least speculating about their calls to each other something worth talking about. Remember, we are listeners to the podcast and we aren't jurors or lawyers. We aren't bound by the rules of law as to what we can discuss or not discuss. You may not agree with this view, and that's fine. But for those of us who *do* want to speculate, we are free to do so.	20141129T145639

Notorganic	7	0	The closest thing I have seen to a plausible motive is that it's been suggested that Hae knew that Jay was cheating on Stephanie and upset about it to the point that she was going to confront him about it.	20141129T132746
ShrimpChimp	3	0	A lot of us get to third person by excluding Adnan and Jay for lack of motive, and then asking if there are ways Hae and Jay could both know someone who was fatally dangerous or unpredictable (poor impulse control, smoking crack for three days planning skills). As someone who knew Jay herself and most likely had hung out with Jay and some Jay people because Adnan got pot from them, it's not a stretch to think Hae knew - actually thought she knew - some of Jay's associates. This, by the way, is not an unusual way for high school and college girls to get into a bad situation. Usually not this bad.	20141129T165452
EsperStormblade	5	0	"Yeah, Jay--as a suspect--is utterly lacking in motive. And, the only way I'd even begin to consider the ""cheating"" narrative floated initially by Adnan and suggested on this sub by Saad and Rabia is if another, outside person corroborated that. So, Jenn P. or Stephanie herself (both unlikely) or, Chris, Jay's good friend at the time...somebody, anybody else not linked to Adnan's defense would have to corroborate it for me to even begin to consider it a possibility. So far, we don't have that."	20141129T135603
anonymous	6	0	This definitely is a good question. However, I do want to caution people to not exclude Jay just because we do not know his motive. People commit murder for all types of reason (sometimes for no apparent reason at all). It is possible that he could have had a motive outside of the information that we currently have available to us.	20141129T163145
samsexton1986	2	0	Maybe they almost crashed in to each other and he flipped. If we discount Jay completely on his lack of motive then we might let the real explanation slip by	20141129T164006

KatieKat22	5	0	I feel though that if Hae was thinking about that or found that out we would have evidence of it in her diary.	20141129T142149
shapshapboetie	2	0	He's a person of interest. He has no apparent motive. But that doesn't mean he is utterly lacking a motive. Just that we don't have enough info to say that he has one. The cheating narrative does have support from something related. From Ep 8: > If he had any weakness, it was Stephanie. Jay would do, he would move heaven and earth if it came to protecting Stephanie. So, maybe he would have motive if he was trying to keep her. Easy to speculate about motive, but with the current info, one is not apparent.	20141129T162909
Notorganic	3	0	Could be. There's a few variables there as to why it may not be in there (ie: when did she find out, how often did she write in her diary etc), but you're probably right.	20141129T151737
Nutbrowndog	1	0	Also, wouldn't she have told Aisha? Instead she's mentioning going to get her cousin and going to see Don but the Jay/Stephanie story is not part of her narrative to any of her closest friends.	20141129T172523
Notorganic	3	0	Has this been independently suggested or corroborated elsewhere? It seems odd to me that if Hae found out about it from Adnan who was covering for Jay by telling Stephanie to be at the assembly that nobody else in their circle of friends would know about it - particularly if it came about after Hae and Adnan had broken up. Then again, so many things about this case seem odd to me (and everyone else). Edit: it also raises the question as to why Jay would tell Adnan he was going to cheat on Stephanie when by all accounts Jay and Adnan aren't really that close; certainly not as close as Stephanie and Adnan were. I know that if I was planning on cheating on my wife, I don't think that I would share that information with one of her friends. It doesn't add up.	20141129T171338
shapshapboetie	2	0	Thanks. I've heard that bandied about in terms of the cheating motive, but hadn't seen it directly. I suppose if Hae bumped into Jay that afternoon, she could have confronted him about that.	20141129T174146
serialmonotony	4	0	How could Adnan taking the stand have exposed inconsistencies in Jay's story? If what Adnan says is true, that he had nothing to do with it, then all he can say is that he didn't do what Jay said, which he's already said by pleading not guilty. The way to expose inconsistencies in Jay's story is, or should have been, by meticulous cross examination of Jay.	20141129T135945
Notorganic	6	0	There's a lot that Gutierrez did wrong in hindsight, we can't know what her deal was really until we get the full report on her conduct. From what we have heard, Gutierrez tried to highlight the inconsistencies in Jays testimony by getting him to call himself a liar (did she nahhhht?). I don't think there's anything you can read into Adnan not testifying, and he has said that it was frustrating sitting there wanting to speak up but not being able to. There are more concerning things, imo.	20141129T132440
partialbigots	1	0	Going on the stand is the worst thing you can do even if you're innocent. It gives the prosecution an unfettered access to attack everything about you in front of the jury, and tear your story apart. They can poke holes in any slight inconsistency you have, or just keep pushing their own theories and make you look worse than you actually are. It is much better to let your attorney bring up the witnesses, the evidence, build the story for you. Anything that makes itself easier for the prosecution to attack you is a terrible idea.	20141129T215512
LadyJusticia	1	0	It is absolutely not true that it is always a mistake to testify on your own behalf. Different defense attorneys have different opinions on whether to encourage clients to testify. Personally, I think it's important for a defendant to testify whenever possible. (The most common reason would be that the defendant has a criminal record that the prosecutor will be allowed to tell the jury about.) The reason that I believe defendants should testify is that most people think like the OP. Most jurors are like the jurors in Adnan's case and will hold it against the defendant if he does not testify, even if they know they shouldn't.	20141130T055153
anonymous	3	0	I know Adnan says his parents would sleep better, if he had done it and they had an answer, instead of having to deal with the injustice that has been put on him. I think it would be extremely difficult for any parent to except their child killed someone, then he denies it for 15 years while draining your retirement. Some parents are extremely forgiving but that would be very tough. If he did do it, I doubt he would confess till after his parents had passed away.	20141129T165217

obsessedserial	-1	0	It's non biased information in a murder case, I'm not saying the coroner would have been able to say exact dates but a time frame to guide the investigation upon. Adnan was arrested two days after the body was found, if I recall correctly. I don't think an autopsy was done before the arrest...	20141129T213340
Hopper80	1	0	I assume an autopsy was done. I have no idea about this sort of thing. Her body was found a month after she went missing. I have no idea if they can determine anything like that - that is, if she were dead 26 days rather than 30. I assume there may be evidence of being physically bound if she'd been held captive, and I haven't heard anything like this mentioned. I presume if the autopsy indicated she'd been dead a week, this would have been raised. Again, I don't know anything about autopsies, but I would assume that there's little if any discernable difference between a body that's 3 1/2 weeks dead, and one that's just over 4 weeks, all else being equal.	20141129T215508

Even Rabia has said that the podcast has pretty much covered everything she knows (besides the defense attorney's incompetence). Whatever your personal beliefs are regarding Adnan's guilt, there is, without question, reasonable doubt. For Judge Heard to be so confident here...it's just irrational. We talk a lot about cognitive biases in this subreddit. Well this one is my favorite, because we literally see it just about everyday. And we all do it. This one is ""irrational escalation"" or ""escalation of commitment."" In this context, the judge has to justify her previous decisions (to the public, yes, but more importantly, to herself -- she put a kid away for life +30). If she listened to the podcasts, there is no doubt she heard some things that she hadn't known about (most importantly, Asia, Adnan's other alibis, and Hae's friend from the gym -- the ""2:36 is impossible"" girl). Despite this new evidence of reasonable doubt, she is just as cocksure as ever. That's an irrational commitment to a decision if I've ever heard one."	20141129T154145

They are just going to attack the judge instead of trying to understand that the judge probably has a lot more insight than them and that her word has weight. As soon as someone with information about the case provides perspective from the other side they get attacked. This Judge was responding to someone on FACEBOOK, not reddit. She is entitled to her beliefs. I for one am glad we get to hear her perspective.	20141129T155827

dixjours	2	0	"""Kinda sounds like"" is not evidence. The judge made this inappropriate comment because she has a vested interest in ensuring that her decisions in the case are not criticized. The actual evidence in the case is far from ""overwhelming."" There's no physical evidence, no forensic evidence, no credible motive evidence, and the only eye witness evidence comes from a lying snitch who had to be coached by the police on what to say. That's not overwhelming."	20141129T155255
anonymous	2	0	In fairness, though, what the trial judge thinks or doesn't think probably won't have much sway over the appellate courts. Unlike trial cases, where the facts are argued, appellate courts deal with procedures. Was there anything in the trial that was improper? Even if today there is DNA evidence that would point to Adnan being innocent, it is rare that an appellate court would vacate a jury verdict and order a prisoner freed. If anything, an appellate court would order a new trial where the new evidence could be considered, which may or may not change the verdict. I don't believe Maryland has an Innocence Commission. My state of North Carolina does. The IC is set up by the state to make sure that people are factually innocent of the crime for which they are serving time. Maryland has no such commission. This will make it difficult (but by no means impossible) for Adnan to be exonerated. But it is a high threshold. (Note: an innocence commission is separate and distinct from the Innocence Project. The former is a state commission that reviews cases while the latter is a private organization. The latter's job is to assistant appellants in getting an appeals court to hear and review their cases.)	20141129T160743

peetnice	4	0	It sounds like the response SK got from one of the detectives, mentioned in a recent episode, and like a lot of the overconfidence that I hear from cops in general (cough cough Fergusn..). Must be a coping mechanism so they can sleep at night. With people's lives at stake, if you second-guess your decisions, then you're pretty much inviting all kinds of trouble both psychologically and professionally.

prettikitti89	6	0	I don't know. After I saw page 2 of the Asia letter, I understood SK wasn't telling us the whole story yet. And Adnan advocates, while passionate, have motive to leave stuff out of their version of events (as well as add details that may not be true).	20141129T151838

I don't know, her saying all this on Facebook just feels a bit inappropriate. edit again - I'm aware that the judge isn't breaking any laws here.

I'd also challenge that the completed prosecution is a different sort of thing than the petitions that have been filed. I find it strange. Get the jury to talk about it's decision process? Okay. One attorney to attack the character of another attorney? Okay.

cbr1965	3	0	I thought we were talking about the trial, judge and evidence/witnesses rather than what posters on reddit believe. My comment was just meant to say the prosecution did a good job getting the jury to buy into Jay as a reasonable, credible witness when we know he is a liar that changed his story multiple times. Gutierrez couldn't rattle Jay or get the jurors to doubt the timeline the prosecution laid out which is questionable at best. The way the trial went, seems the judge believed everything the prosecution said too based on her FB comment.	20141129T152311
anonymous	2	0	I just re-read both Asia letters; nothing really struck me as suspicious - can you explain what you mean by this? Also I agree that if you presume Adnan's guilt or innocence, it makes every detail of the case look different.	20141129T154206
abeliangrape	2	0	He's talking nonsense. If you look at his comment history, you'd see just how ridiculously biased he is. To anyone with a level head, it's obvious that the jury's decision says nothing about the truth of the case now. They did not have nearly the wealth of information we did.	20141129T161214
vladdvies	1	0	It's not like she delved into intricate detail about the case. She commented a opinion and that opinion carries weight. Also whats a good time limit to weigh in on a past case? 20 years? 25 years? 30 years?	20141129T161214

abeliangrape	2	0	A judge does exactly what it says on the tin: she judges the validity of arguments/evidence/etc that's presented to her. A judge does not conduct an investigation. A judge does not unearth new information. Therefore what she thinks today is pretty much irrelevant. She basically has three options: 1. Say the new evidence is irrelevant, and stand by her decision. 2. Say the new evidence is relevant, but the evidence presented at the trial made it look like Adnan did it, so the judgment was valid given the circumstances at the time. 3. Say the new evidence is relevant, and that the evidence presented at the trial was inconclusive, and basically admit to fucking shit up. To take the 3rd option is at the very least career suicide, so that's out the window. To take the 2nd option is to basically admit that the legal system is a sham, and that innocent people can be jailed on very shaky evidence. Even if judges think this happens all the time, nobody wants to think that it happens to them. Even if they think it happens to them, knowing a specific instance where your mistake landed an actual person in jail probably weighs quite heavily on your conscience. She wasn't going to do that either. So the only option she can take is the 1st one and her Facebook post means nothing for this case.	20141129T163155
moleratical	9	0	If it were during the case or if she was still involved in the case in any capacity whatsoever I would agree. But being a judge does not invalidate other human traits like having an opinion or speaking out when it might be wiser to keep quiet. I don't think that we should expect these things from her, she no longer has any connection to the current appeals process so she is free to express herself as she likes.	20141129T152944
prettikitti89	1	0	"Asia says on page 2 of the first letter, ""I will try my best to help you account for some of your unwitnessed, unaccountable lost time (2:15-8:00)"" See it here: http://m.imgur.com/lEZkM6Z She is saying she'll say see saw him at the library, not that she saw him there. Combine that with the fact that she just came from his parents house, even though she barely knew Adnan, and that she admits in the letter she wrote it because Justin prompted her, the Asia alibi letters are worthless. The appeals huge was right. It sounds like a lie. SK didn't mention any of this in the podcast. Look at it yourself."	20141129T201442
asha24	2	0	Yes I see your point, but it's a slippery slope. What if after a trial a defendant is found not guilty and a judge takes to twitter announcing how he/she knows this person is actually guilty? I think just to err on the side of caution judges should be held to a higher standard and should refrain from commenting on their past cases on social media in such a fashion.	20141129T155422
anonymous	1	0	Yeah, I read that, and it sounds like she's saying that *because* she knows he was at the library, she wants to help him. She started off the letter saying she definitely say him at the lib that day. I really don't see anything suspicious going on here other than poor writing skills.	20141129T204252

reddit1101	1	0	For me, the 2:36 call could possibly from Hae, perhaps. She just got his number the night before, scribbled it in her diary, maybe she had it with her. To my knowledge, Hae does not have a cell phone though but could have used a pay phone. However, the 3:15 is definitely not from Hae. That is likely Adnan calling just after the murder. Check out my detailed timeline with all calls from the call log - http://redd.it/2nnrxx	20141129T164502

anonymous	1	0	I've seen the cheating claim dismissed a bunch here, and I'm not sure why - it does seem legit. Not that it's necessarily proof that Jay killed Hae, or anything drastic like that. But did that conversation actually happen?	20141129T164457
anonymous	1	0	Why would she choose to confront Jay when she's on her way to pick up her cousin, visit Don, and then make it to the wrestling match? That seems improbable to me; too busy to give Adnan a ride, but not too busy to arrange a confrontation with a friend's boyfriend, when she's got all that other shit to do?	20141129T221535
Truetowho	1	0	Seems very possible that the 2:36 call is from Hae, thinking that she is calling Adnan. Possibly, she calls from pay phone from somewhere. Jay doesn't answer because it's Adnan's phone, and he reasonably assumes that the person calling wants to speak with Adnan, not with him. He is not expecting Adnan to call until much later.	20141130T005051
Superben14	0	0	2:36 - Hae calls looking for Adnan. Jay picks up and tells her he's borrowing Adnan's phone and hangs up. 3:15 - Hae decides that while she can get a hold of Jay she might as well call him to confront him about Stephanie.	20141129T171605
MisoSoup	1	0	I read your excellent time-line post and found it plausible and persuasive. However, the 7.00 pm page from Jay to Jenn? Why would he page her 1 hour before he was finished? Before he had even started burying the body. He wouldn't be able to give any reasonable estimate as to when he would be ready.	20141129T183505
lasta84	2	0	"I just read through that link thanks for posting. I think the new evidence that has come out kind of puts this idea back on the board though. The dismiss seems to be that Hae only had a pager on her, so she wouldn't be able to call. But she wouldn't have had to call them from her car necessarily. The call pinged the L651 tower which, from the cell tower map is close to the school and the Best Buy. It's been discussed that the Best Buy had phones (possibly in the lobby) and I'm guessing the school had phones. And I'm saying she's still at school after the latest episode put forward evidence from her wrestling manager ""friend"" that there was no way Hae could've been killed at 2.36pm because she was still at the school around this time... Her wrestling manager friend (who I can't remember the name of... Sylvia?) said Hae was telling her what to do at the practice or something because she hadn't helped out before."	20141129T163702
masondog13	1	0	The only place we've seen the cheating claim is in a note from the executive assistant to Adnan's lawyers. We haven't heard it from Adnan on this podcast in any of the nine episodes nor have we heard it from any of Adnan's friends or Hae's friends in their interviews on the podcast. I'm dismissing it until we get one corroboration. Otherwise it's just off-hand speculation that failed at trial. Why would Hae tell only Adnan about this? Seems a bit convenient, no?	20141129T171559
masondog13	1	0	"So she has to pick up her cousin, as she has done before, but decides, ""hey, isn't it a great time to confront Jay about cheating?"" She had no time to do it because she had to pick up her cousin and then go to that wrestling match she was driving to instead of taking the bus. Doesn't make sense that she initiated the alleged confrontation with Jay."	20141129T171838

cthulhu8	13	0	Now on the other hand, what strikes me odd about Jay's story - if Jay made his whole story up, he'd be taking a MAJOR risk that Adnan wouldn't have had several witness stating that he was in the library, that he not late to track practice, and that he was at mosque. If Jay was lying, was is just pure luck that only one person saw him in the library, no one remembers him at track, and only his dad would confirm his presence at the mosque?	20141129T191530
mrmiffster	19	0	I would like to know this too. Adnan's dad testified that he was there, but for some reason that didn't hold up. It's sort of strange to me that Adnan actually has quite a few alibis that came forward for that day, but for some reason none of them held up in court. Yet Jay has no real alibi for the time that Hae went missing (he said he was with Jen but he was calling her house during that time so we know he wasn't), and the time that Hae was buried. If there are other people that can really vouch that Adnan was indeed at Mosque that night I think we can be pretty certain that Jay murdered Hae alone and wrap this up. I'm sure Rabia has looked into this. I would love to know more about Mosque that night! If even one person at the Mosque could prove that they saw him between 7-8 on the 13th we can be certain that Jay is the murderer.	20141129T163939
Glitteranji	5	0	"Here's the thing about going to mosque during Ramadan, especially the last 10 nights. Many people seem to understand this in terms of more like a specific event that starts at a certain time, and that you would be ""late"" for, which would draw attention, or as some sort of formal event, like a Christian church sermon, where it would be noticeable if you came in and out (such as to go use the phone). This is not like a formal sit down service, like some of the other mentioned Christian services, for example, that has a specific starting time, where everyone comes in and is seated as a group, then the pastor stands up in front of the group and goes through a pre-determined program of service. Where people sit nicely in their seats and look around the room and take in their surroundings. This is more like an open house free-for-all thing. There are definite, set programs throughout Ramadan, which will often include lectures and speeches/talks by religious figures. They could be renown scholars from other mosques or other states & countries, or they might be members of that particular mosque who will give a talk. These programs will, of course, have a set start and end time, where people will come in to be seated and listen. However, there can also be other programs going on in other rooms, such as a youth program where they're talking to the teens about topical issues, and there will still be other people coming in and out of the main prayer room doing their prayers. They may have gotten off late from work, they may have missed an earlier prayer, they may want to do additional prayers, whatever. Before you can pray, you also have to perform ablutions, which is a ritual cleansing before prayer. So, even with a set program, you may have people coming in and out of the bathrooms, the main prayer room and then into the lecture hall, all at different times. Depending upon the mosque, there can be other events throughout the evening during Ramadan. Some will offer an iftar meal to break the fast, there will be people there cooking and serving, other people coming in after they've had their meal elsewhere (at home, at a friend or family home, at a restaurant), and then come in to hang out at the mosque. There may be various games going on, say religion and history trivia games, or even just things like ""Who's Got the Button"" type group games. Yeah, I know, lol. Anyway. A family may come together, and then the mom has to leave to take the little kids home and get them to bed, but the dad may decide to stay later and catch a ride home with someone else. Or maybe the teens and dad will stay. Various different things. This all becomes even more of a free for all during the last ten nights. During this time, there tend to be fewer of those other programs going on, and more time devoted to prayer and recitation of quran. It's like all of the above, but with more ""in and out,"" because not every person will come in at a specific time and stay all night long. People come and go as they wish and are able. There is no ""late,"" and especially in these days of cell phones, it's typical for people to also step out to talk on the phone or have a cigarette. Now, finally, they way Muslims pray is very individual. It's not like sitting in pews and bowing your heads or kneeling for a group prayer, and then back to sitting and looking all around. Muslims each pray individually. They will be standing and prostrating in rows alongside each other, but at the same, each person is saying his own prayer and doing his own movements in a ritual sequence. At the end of the prayer, you may sit on your rug and then use your prayer beads or count on your fingers as you recite and repeat phrases of exultation to God, much like a rosary. Each person doing that will be talking quietly to himself, and may even sit with their eyes closed and/or their heads down. You could very well sit and pray for a long while and not even know who is praying a couple of rows behind you, until such time as you may decide to take a break and step away and happen to notice them. Even so, you wouldn't interrupt them as they're praying. You are going to be more likely to stop and talk to someone out in the hallways, and then decide to step out to smoke, or that it's time to head to another room to eat or whatever. You might have to leave for a couple hours to go do something else, and then come back again later. This is all going on pretty much most of the night for ten nights, after the previous 20 nights of any number of activities, both scheduled and informal. You're not late, stepping in and out isn't interrupting anything, and during prayer time, people are concentrating on their own individual prayers or reading/reciting quran. I hope this helps, because it's really a different sort of thing than I think most people are imagining, and not quite like a singular church service or group event at all."	20141130T033643
anonymous	7	0	The question is why the jury didn't believe the dad. And why the attorney didn't work harder to bring more witnesses who could back him up, assuming they existed. We don't know if she even tried to find them.	20141129T171519
naomio	5	0	Ramadan lasts for a whole month so I don't see why it's surprising that no one else could remember whether they'd seen him on that particular day. The jury may also have thought his Dad couldn't have been sure for the same reason.	20141129T173819
anonymous	10	0	in the first episode, SK starts out asking how many of us can account for our whereabouts 6 weeks ago. It can be surprisingly difficult. It's Ramadan. There are plenty of people going to and from the mosque. A popular kid who is always at the mosque, would people necessarily remember if he were late or absent on a specific night from 6 weeks ago? Part of me wonders about my own church. I know who the golden kids are at my church. Can I remember if one of them was or wasn't absent from church 6 weeks ago? No. And we are Lutheran: we have covered dish suppers at the drop of a hat. With all the goings on with something like that, I definitely couldn't tell if someone was there or not or late or not. So, with this understanding, I believe that whether or not Adnan was at the mosque cannot be easily corroborated.	20141129T174846
Truetowho	3	0	Adnan seems to talk on the phone A LOT. No calls on phone to friends = Adnan does not have phone.	20141130T035634
I_W_N_R	7	0	It's not totally surprising to me that Adnan had no other witnesses for this. For their testimony to be helpful - they'd not only have to remember seeing him at mosque that particular night, but what specific time they saw him. If you were to ask me about a gathering I attended a month or two ago, I'd probably be able to remember at least approximately what time I was there with my family. But if you asked me about seeing a friend or acquaintance, I'd probably remember whether I saw them or not, but unless there were something specific to tie it to - like arriving at the same time - I doubt I could put a time stamp on it. Also - a couple of other things to remember here: 1) Hae was almost certainly dead by this time. So we're talking about Adnan's alibi for the burial of the body, not the actual murder. 2) The cell tower pings are not specific enough to place Adnan's phone in Leakin Park. That general area - yes. But not inside the park.	20141129T175844
anonymous	7	0	The Muslim community in Baltimore is rather big. ISB has hundreds show up for the evening prayers during Ramadan (especially in the last ten days which are most special). Also keep in mind that for 30 days straight, there are evening prayers at the Mosque. It would be near impossible to remember specifically which night he was there and which he wasn't.	20141129T180915
MaleGimp	2	0	Another issue - Adnan was supposed to be really high and acting strangely. How could this go unnoticed during the gathering at the mosque? And if drugs were such a big no no for the muslim community, why get so high if you are really planning to go to mosque later?	20141129T173336

Some people commenting here seem to be under the impression that the police checked it out and yet no one was willing to confirm. Others are asserting that people refused to confirm his presence based on one statement from Rabia about the way the community reacted to him after his arrest and information was coming out. I understood her to be speaking in general terms about the way some people reacted to him, not specifically about stating whether or not he was at the mosque that night during that time frame. What is actually known about this so far? Also, people are talking about his father's testimony being ""thrown out."" Was this the case, and what does that actually mean? Or are people just trying to reason out how his father's testimony wouldn't hold a lot of weight with the jurors, but was still presented in court?"	20141130T030618
Lehcaro	2	0	I can't tell from your post whether you're aware or not, so thought it might be worth pointing out for anyone who isn't - Ramadan is a month long event, in which Muslims fast (and possibly go to mosque) every day. Eid is the day of celebration at the end of it. So Adnan's presence, or lack thereof, at mosque isn't necessarily that big of a deal from the perspective of the other people there...	20141130T164414

The_Chairman_Meow	11	0	But you're forgetting the fact that Jay is a Machiavellian criminal mastermind, with no motive, who's obviously a scheming sociopath.

mrmiffster	4	0	I think when you consider that Jay was brought in AFTER the cops began investigating Adnan as a murder suspect it wasn't really that big of a risk. Jay knew that the cops already found it plausible that Adnan was the killer, so he could fairly assume Adnan did not have air tight alibis. Plus the cops let Jay change his story 10 or so times over the course of his 3 testimonies. It's not a huge risk when you throw out 10 different scenarios. One is bound to stick.	20141129T192529

readybrek	1	0	Jay is very keen to place Adnan at track. He says Adnan said he needed it for an alibi. For Jay it's actually the other way round at track - if Adnan desperately wanted an alibi why didn't he act in any kind of memorable way? Rabia also says there is a student who places Adnan at the school at 3pmish dressed for track. I'm looking forward to her posting the proof of that.	20141130T182330
anonymous	1	0	There was a witness that Adnan was at the library, Asia.	20141130T005041
anonymous	11	0	That's exactly what I'm feeling. The most compelling piece of evidence (besides Jay's testimony) that Adnan could be guilty is the fact that his phone was in the park during the burial *combined with* the fact that we don't know whether he went to mosque that night. Just knowing what we do know, it's possible to interpret that multiple different ways, but it would be so much more certain if we really *knew* where he was!	20141129T164155
anonymous	7	0	> Yet Jay has no real alibi for the time that Hae went missing (he said he was with Jen but he was calling her house during that time so we know he wasn't), and the time that Hae was buried. This stuck out to me - I wonder what would have happened if police had latched onto Jay from the beginning. If they had (somehow) assumed he was lying about Adnan. If they had believed what Adnan said about Jay's cheating (it's a ridiculous motive, but so is Adnan's). They could have made the case that Jay was the sole murderer so easily, and I wonder how many people would have bought it? I know this is rambling, but it's just making me think about how so much of he weight of a criminal trial is the accusation itself.	20141129T173016
ReaderThinker	4	0	Adnan hasn't even said how long he was supposedly at mosque that night. I think the father said it lasted until 10:30pm, but we all know that Adnan was not there that long because he was calling friends all night from 9pm on, so how could he be making these calls if he was praying at the mosque? Based on the phone records, he could have only been there between around 8pm and 9pm. Or would he have had time to call people FROM the mosque?	20141129T174555

anonymous	2	0	This is a good point (and the fact that she didn't get *anyone* else to testify that he was at Mosque was so stupid). Something that just struck me - I wonder if the prosecution tried to find anyone to testify that Adnan *wasn't* at mosque? Their case depends on the idea that Adnan's father was lying, so wouldn't it have helped to find someone to confirm this? I wonder if they tried and couldn't find anyone who couldn't remember, or if they didn't try at all.	20141129T171758
anonymous	2	0	That's a good point. Still not sure it would have gone unnoticed for him to skip, though... Edit: someone reminded me that it was the last day of Ramadan, though. That's a lot more significant.	20141129T173912

anonymous	2	0	These are all good points. Again, a lot of it comes down to how many people attended this Mosque (the fewer there were, the more noticeable an absence would have been), and how big of a deal it would be for someone to skip the service. Based on my (extremely limited) understanding of Islam and of this particular community, it would have been a pretty huge issue if he hadn't been there. Not that that necessarily means it would have been noticed.	20141129T175721
mcakez	5	0	"Right. Going to a gathering (I am reading this as 'event') is different than going to something you attend every week or sometimes nightly. I imagine most people wouldn't remember if they saw someone at church services weeks before, unless they had some reason to notice. I teach high school and if you ask me if a student was absent six weeks ago, without me checking attendance, I would only be able to offer my best guess. Which goes one of three ways, ""Probably not: that student never misses class,"" ""Probably: that student is never here,"" and ""I have no idea: that student has irregular attendance."" If the answer is the first one, I can usually drag out an extra detail, for example ""I do remember that Adnan missed a day a few weeks ago."" If Adnan was more of the first type, it should have been semi-noticeable to someone - his parents or friends, for example - but asking anyone to remember something like they had no significant reason to notice on a particular day six weeks before is just so unreliable."	20141129T183104

anonymous	1	0	Adnan's father testifies that he was at the mosque from about 7:30-10:30. Jay testifies that Adnan was burying the body for at least a chunk of that time. And Adnan's phone pings to the cell tower nearest the location of the body twice during the time Jay said they were burying the body. So, it really comes down to conflicting testimony. Adnan's father's testimony wasn't thrown out as far as I know (I think that might just be poor language choice). But it's assumed that the jury didn't believe him, since his testimony would have provided Adnan with an alibi during the time of the burial. Aside from that, there doesn't seem to be any confirmation one way or the other. The Rabia post some people are taking about included Rabia saying that a bunch of people in the local Muslim community cut Adnan out after the trial, but we also know that many people wrote him letters of support and character statements. So I think it's mixed. You're right that police didn't get any other witness statements about that - though it's unclear whether that's from lack of trying, or from lack of being able to find any witnesses (I personally would assume the former).	20141130T035058
anonymous	3	0	You mean get the whole mosque lying and giving false testimony to the police to protect a guy who had stolen from them and was known to be behaving immorally and who they maybe believed was a murderer? Yeah... that is a bit odd.	20141129T175601
KanKan669	1	0	Another Redditor mentioned that Rabia spoke about this in a podcast. She said that after the Muslim community found out about the drugs and sex, they kind of turned their back on Adnan. So, if that's the case, even if they DID see him they might not have testified.	20141129T173336
anonymous	1	0	Right? It's so strange. Maybe it's possible that people might have remembered *more* if he wasn't there? It can be easier to remember things we don't expect than to remember what we do expect. OTOH, memory conforms to expectations.	20141129T170953
anonymous	3	0	No one accounts for him being there for the same reason his Dad's testimony wasn't considered and the same reason the prosecution couldn't get any witnesses to say Adnan wasn't there -- it's very difficult to remember who was at an event on a specific night several weeks ago. Especially weekly events like mosque which can all blend together in your memory.	20141129T224934
anonymous	3	0	> maybe it's because the community turned against him once it was revealed he was an adulterous stoner. I think this is a big part of it. For example, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2nq4c9/muslim_podcast_diffused_congruence_with_interview/) just got posted. Very interesting. I also wonder which is more likely: that the mosque community would remember him being there, or that they would remember him *not* being there. I find it fairly plausible that they would be likely to remember his absence, since it would be a **really** big deal for him to miss worship, especially on Ramadan. It's clear from the link I just shared and from a lot of other accounts that this was a pretty devout community; I don't think that it would be likely to go unnoticed if a young member of the community skipped worship, especially on a religious holiday.	20141129T173603

mixingmemory	8	0	http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/26/serial-why-jays-testimony-is-not-credible-evidence-of-adnans-guilt/ >By giving Jay at least four interviews and a ride-along, and by challenging Jay each time his story did not match the known evidence, the police informed Jay of what parts of his story they could disprove, and — just as significantly — they also implicitly told Jay which parts of his story they could not disprove. For instance, in the second interview, when questioning Jay about where Hae’s body was discovered, they (1) explicitly alerted Jay to the fact that another witness (Jenn) was giving a story that didn’t match his; and (2) implicitly alerted Jay to the fact that they had not discovered any evidence — such as security cameras — that could prove or disprove that the murder happened there. >So it’s no surprise that, as the investigation went on, and as Jay was interviewed more and more often, the story that Jay told began to fit the evidence “a lot better.” And the resulting consistencies between his story and the known facts are in no way evidence that Jay had finally decided to start telling the truth.	20141130T005125

juless18	5	0	I've thought about this a lot, too. The police didn't care about the truth, they wanted the strongest case. But I'm sure about Jay being involved in the murder (we can't know for sure if he was the sole murderer or had help) and not Adnan. The police had already settled their minds on Adnan and Jay's testimony just helped them. If they had to start from scratch with Jay being the suspect, that would mean more work. I can't understand why people would do this, but I'm pretty sure this happens all the damn time with many cases. It's really frustrating. I hope the Innocence Project comes up with something to help Adnan...	20141129T193000

That's consistent with the family not lying to cover for him. The defense lawyer could probably have done a better job of convincing the jury that the dad is not likely to lie, but you're right, it'd be hard to get past the fact that he is Adnan's father."	20141129T175726

If I thought she was getting railroaded and me lying would help her, I might. But I really, really hate lying -- when other people do it I can't ever quite get past it. The dad made a choice to go to court and be publicly questioned, and he was a devout sort of person, according to what we know. The Muslim culture that's been slowly exposed to us over the last couple of months is part of what makes me think he wouldn't have done that. Maybe the jury (all westerners?) just assumed a parent would always lie, like you say. I wouldn't have.	20141129T180125

AmazingWanderer	3	0	I'm from the Baltimore area and although I was just a kid when this happened, my cousins who are all much older than me told me this was a lie. Rabia was only a few years older than adnan. Maybe she has forgotten about all the community members coming to his trial every day. One particular man in our community paid for all of his lawyer expenses. This mosque was just a house back in the day, so the community is tight-knit. For Rabia to say that my community didn't do anything and turned their backs is very hurtful because back then, the ISB community did as much as they could. Most of their words meant nothing to the court, and that's not our fault...	20141130T162330
happydee	3	0	liked it better when Rabia said Muslims come out of the woodwork to go to the Mosque during Ramadan, so it would be hard to verify his attendance. But now this. Poor Andand, everyone's against him, the cops, the witnesses, the judge, the jury, his own lawyer, etc. etc. > I was just listening to Rabia on another podcast and she was saying that the Muslim community really turned their back on Adnan once they found out about the drugs and sex, so maybe that's why no one wanted to get involved?	20141129T212001

anonymous	5	0	I mean, the only reason I don't think it was Jay *without* Adnan is that Jay seemingly lacks a motive. There's that comment of Adnan's about how Hae knew Jay was cheating on Stephanie, but that's still pretty thin.... but definitely not much more thin than the Adnan-as-jilted-lover motive.	20141129T203615
fight_like_a_cow	15	0	"Mosque clarification: The way prayers work in Ramadan is that there are typically units of prayer that would last 10-15 mins followed by a ""break"" of two minutes. One could potentially step out in-between these units of prayer fairly easily. The whole service would last approximately one and a half to two hours uninterrupted but like I said, it's pretty flexible to come and go and possibly skip. When I was a (naughty) kid, I would pray the first couple of cycles to ""show face"" to my dad, then head out to my friend's house for an hour to play Sega Genesis and then head back to the mosque to catch the tail-end of the service... hopefully before my dad would notice that I was gone the entire time. It was a classic move by kids... and a great way to sneak in NHL 94."	20141129T183744

anonymous	7	0	This is the kind of thinking that drives me nuts. We don't know the lengths or efforts of the police or Adnan's lawyer in seeking out a witness to testify on Adnan's behalf. We don't WHEN they would have been asked. If it was six weeks after the fact for example, that would be a very difficult thing to remember. Also, I imagine one trip to the mosque isn't distinguishable from the next. The idea that because only Adnan's dad remembers he was there he's automatically guilty is absurd.	20141129T180340
juless18	1	0	Why exactly do you think Adnan wasn't at mosque? Just because there was no other alibi? We don't know if his deffense attorney even tried to find another alibi. And if so, maybe she only tried that after Adnan was already in jail and then many people might have been influenced by that and didn't want to get involved.	20141129T194209

anonymous	2	0	But the opposite is just as justifiable: if he did go, people might not remember because it's expected of him, and/or because there were lots of other people there. Plus, maybe if everyone was immersed in prayer, they wouldn't be paying attention to other people. If he didn't go, then people might have noticed because it would be strange for him not to be there. Both your hypothetical and my hypothetical are equally explainable, so without actual testimony, it's really hard to claim that one explanation makes more sense.	20141129T211450
asha24	5	0	No that's not what I'm saying, I'm not saying that people were purposefully trying to get him convicted, just that maybe people wanted nothing to do with the case, there wasn't an effort made within the community to see if someone remembered seeing him. Actually whenever people talk about Adnan being at the Mosque that night, I think about Christmas Eve mass that my mom always makes me go to, and how packed the church is. I'm definitely not looking around to see if there's people I know there, sometimes you can't even sit with your family because there's no room. Since it was Ramadan, I'm sure the Mosque was just as packed, so maybe because it's so full, probably with a lot of people who aren't regulars (I know I don't go to church on any other holiday than Christmas), his presence/absence was not noticed.	20141129T211012

readybrek	1	0	No definitely - here's Hae's timeline and the episodes they are mentioned that I posted for someone else. Episode 2 She was seen about 2.20pm after last class by Becky and Aisha also confirms she saw Hae talking to Adnan at that time. Episode 9 She was speaking to Summer from about 2.30pm/2.45pm ish for at least 10 minutes in the Gym area. After last bell and after the regular school buses had cleared the loop around school. Episode 9 Debbie Warren says she saw Hae about 3pmish inside the Gym (there must be a police note somewhere about this - I'd like to see the original but it seems SK has!) Episode 2 And finally Inez Butler Hendricks see Hae, no time given but Hae pulls up to buy her usual juice and hot fries before leaving the school apparently on her own. She seems in a hurry because she pulls up and leaves her car running (how long will it take to get to her 3.15pm pickup?) She tells Inez to ask the bus to wait for her despite having told Summer she was going to make her own way to wrestling. edited for a correction, Debbie Warren told the cops that she saw Hae inside the school near the Gym.	20141130T182733

If Serial has taught me anything is: if ever accused of a crime, have a really, really good defense attorney.	20141129T181212

blancnoise	4	0	"His dad may have given this time specifically because: 1. During the last ten days of Ramadan, his father spent this time in worship at the mosque, in itikaf. Typically, people will deliver food (dinner) to those in itikaf in order for them to break their fast (people in itikaf do not leave the mosque at all until after sunset of the last fast of Ramadan). According to Adnan/his family, he would take food for his father, so perhaps 7:30 pm was the usual time that Adnan delivered food for his father. If this was typical and he wasn't around to deliver the food, why are there no calls to his phone from his family asking where he is? Yes, there are incoming calls on Adnan's phone at 7:09pm and 7:16pm and in his testimony, Jay does say that the 7:09pm call is from Jen, wanting to speak to him - Adnan answers. Jay also says that the 7:16pm call Adnan answers and speaks in Arabic. The Serial Podcast revealed that Adnan does not speak Arabic or Urdu (a language commonly spoken by the Pakistani community). If Adnan could not deliver the food to his father, would it have been a big deal? Would a licensed sibling (if there were any) or his mother, drop off the food instead? would it have caused a problem? e.g. *mother to adnan* you weren't home Adnan so I had to take your younger brother and go drop off the food, why can't you do this for your father? The reason I say this is because if it was a big deal that Adnan wasn't around to do it on that day, I'd imagine his family might remember that day if it had caused them an inconvenience and he did it every other day of the ten days. 2. According to what has been posted here, around Jan 19th is when Eid would have been celebrated that year. Therefore, on the evening of the 13th, the mosque would have held the regular Esha prayers (part of the 5 daily prayers), and also Taraweeh prayers (held only in Ramadan). Depending on how the Imam at the mosque led the Taraweeh prayers (if he was trying to finish an entire Quran over the course of the approx 30 days of Ramadan), Taraweeh prayers can go on for a long time, +/_ and hour and a half. Given the two points above, it is conceivable to me for Adnan's father to provide this sort of time frame as the evening would have included: Dinner/Esha/Taraweeh with possible breaks in between. In terms of other people being able to specifically account for Adnan being at the mosque this day out of all the days in Ramadan, 6 weeks or plus later, well, I think even if it was a small community at the mosque, it would be difficult for anyone to remember. If it was a large community, it would more difficult still. There's no roll call at prayer and I wouldn't think that people would specifically notice if someone was there or not and remember weeks later. If you show up for prayer, props, typically more people make an effort in Ramadan, but if not, people can also pray at home. What has already been mentioned here is the phone call log and the calls made during this window. Somebody has mentioned the possibility of Adnan stepping out. To my knowledge, most mosques have specific prayer times (which change throughout the year i.e. sunrise/sunset times change throughout the year, so prayer times change too). Typically, there is a timetable of adhan (call to prayer) at x time, and the actual prayers themselves starting after this at x (maybe 10-15min after adhan). It would be interesting to know this information for the mosque that Adnan's family attended for that Ramadan. It would give a little more insight into Adnan's father's account, though I dont think it would necessarily prove/disprove whether Adnan was there, as it has been mentioned, people may step out during prayers and those praying would be unlikely to notice or think much of it. There is information available in terms of the time at which each of the 5 prayers begin during this year here: http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/splitthemoon/files/2014/10/Screenshot-2014-10-31-at-2.37.07-AM.png I would add that simple conclusions cannot be drawn in terms of, Esha time (the prayer prior to Taraweeh) being 6:11pm means that prayers would start at that time, no. There is a wide window of time to pray Esha and typically, most mosques make allowances for people to come home from work, eat, when considering what time to conduct prayer. What is curious to me is who paged Jen at 7pm and why (if Adnan and Jay were both together). It doesn't seem too far a stretch to consider that both the incoming phone calls after this page were from Jen, responding to the page. As noted earlier, Jay and Jenn confirm the first phone call is from her. Clearly, Jay knew about this murder and let's go with there being a second person (but not Adnan). Did this second person threaten Jay and/or threaten to hurt Stefanie? Did Jay then discuss his involvement with Jen before picking up Adnan from track practice? Given it was Hae who was dead, wouldn't it appear obvious to them to want to try and pin it on Adnan in order to protect Jay and Stefanie from whoever was threatening them? Going back to the timeline of events, Adnan went to track practice that day. Jay's first and second interview suggest track either finished at 5:45pm (1st interview) or 6:45pm (2nd interview). In one of the podcast interviews, it was suggested by someone else on the track team that it wasn't unusual for Jay to pick up Adnan from track. If it was a fairly normal occurrence, wouldn't Jay have known what time track typically finished, so why the discrepancy between interview 1 and 2? Also, take a look at the testimony and note the discrepancy in interviews as to when track started. Generally, the times that Jay says he dropped off Adnan at track practice is around the time that Adnan says track practice finished. In his 2nd testimony at trial, Jay said he picked up Adnan from track at 6:10pm. Then, they arrived at Cathy's house at 6:25pm. Cathy said that Adnan was really stoned at her house, but that Jay did not appear to be stoned. How far is ""Cathy's"" house from the school? If you’re fasting, and it sounds like Adnan did observe fasting from the Podcast, most people typically when they break their fast, want to eat something. If Adnan went to track and sunset was at 4:50pm that day, the time when he could break his fast, did he bring food to eat during track to break his fast? If not, surely he'd want to head out for food after track? Also, why observe fasting and kill someone in Ramadan? According to Jay's testimony at the second trial, when the two phone calls came through at 7:09pm and 7:16pm (after they left ""Cathy's"" house), Jay's testimony timeline indicates that at this time, they were at Jay's house collecting two shovels. BUT, also in his testimony, he states that when Jen called to speak to him i.e. the 7:09pm phone call, he and Adnan were burying the body. So, clearly an inconsistency, one which to me, seems significant. After these phone calls to Adnan's phone, Jen is paged again, 45 min later at 8:04pm and 8:05pm, with the next phone call an hour later to Nisha at 9:01pm, which in all likeliness is a phone call Adnan made. What is clear is that Jay did not call Jen from Adnan's phone if he needed her to pick him up from somewhere. But if Jay had spoken to Jen, if they had made some sort of plan, the page could have been a simple, hey can you pick me up at the agreed upon place that we spoke about earlier. I don't know, it's not all there of course, and I guess yeah, I'd like to believe Adnan. If Adnan did drop off food for his dad that day, given how stoned he was by ""Cathy's"" account, would he have been able to drive? Might he have dropped off Jay and gone home himself? Who are the unaccounted incoming calls from between 4:27pm and 6:24pm? During the time of some of these calls, according to his testimony timeline, Jay would have been by himself (i.e. not with Adnan) and had Adnan's cell and car. If he was by himself, how many people would have known to contact Jay on Adnan's phone number, given Adnan had only just bought the phone and it therefore would not have been typical for people to try to contact Jay on Adnan's phone. If the phone calls were for Adnan, it doesn't take a person more than a few seconds to say 'hey, Adnan's not here but I'll get him to call you back'. Look at the length of some of these calls. Might Jay have have dropped Adnan off at home and borrowed Adnan's car (and cell) for a couple of hours and then made his way back to Adnan's to return the car while someone else waited in another car to give him a ride? Like fieryjak points out: what was happening between the 6:59pm call to Yaser (from Adnan which according to Jay's testimony timeline at 2nd trial would have occurred at ""Cathy's"" house) and the 9:01pm call to Nisha (from Adnan) is significant. If Adnan was at the Mosque (or elsewhere), he got his cell back off Jay before 9:01pm."	20141130T034706
anonymous	1	0	Because either he's a) lying to protect his son or b) a father would remember the specific day their son missed Mosque, particularly if Adnan is correct and Adnan would bring him food to break the fast. There isn't anyway of telling which is which, hence the purpose of the post we are commenting on.	20141129T212059
anonymous	1	0	Because Adnan's dad definitely would have interacted with him if he were at the Mosque. Out of all the people there, he has the most reason to remember seeing Adnan. So it's different from all the other people who only may or may not have being paying attention.	20141129T215217

MusicCompany	1	0	I don't know, but the hard line call struck me too. It's also possible that Adnan called to the hard line not to save money, but because he didn't want the call to be tracked to his phone.	20141129T171954

wntrwhte	1	0	I agree that was really weird. It just wasn't that common to call with a cell back then. Although it seems like a lot of parties involved had cell phones, which also seems strange to me. Almost nobody I knew had a cell in 1999. I've never been clear on why Jay needed the car AND the phone. The phone was not a car based model and there was no real reason to give him the phone with the car. Even if he doesn't have his own cell, everyone had pagers back then, so Adnan could have paged him to call him back and the story would have been exactly the same except with two-way records.	20141130T033133
demosthenesjax	10	0	A lot of his calls were after 8pm. I had a cell phone in 1999, and I made most of my calls after 8pm too, because nights and weekends didn't count against you, at least that was the case on my plan.	20141129T183237

Also, didn't Jay say that at some point Adnan called him to make sure the phone was on? Was he not getting thru on the cell and then called Jay to have him check the phone? Maybe he called Jenn's home phone. Just speculation...trying to make sense of this fiasco of a case.	20141129T175546

reddit1101	7	0	"It was premeditated. He knew he'd be driving her car afterwards. In his 17-18 year old mind, he's got to make it look like a random murder. Or hope her body never gets discovered. He didn't think it through very much. But most first time perpetrators don't. His plan was to ""get rid of the body"", and it ended up in the park. His plan for the car was ""to abandon it"", since he and Jay are on the move and he can't be seen in her car, they decide by the park is fine. I actually think because Leakin Park is known for dead bodies that Adnan didn't expect her body to be found. Even if it was a shallow grave. I'm going to be really macabre here but somewhere on reddit I read that Jay told the police Adnan wanted to visit Hae's body on more than one occasion. Jay declined. This is classic serial killer behavior. They want to return to the scene of the crime, the burial site, and do who knows what. Jay really has no reason to bring this little fact up, other than it's something Adnan really said. Jay also said Adnan was very specific where he wanted to bury her (a place Adnan and Hae used to have sex). Maybe the reason the grave was only 6 inches deep was so he could revisit Hae's body. Here is my full theory - http://redd.it/2nnrxx"	20141129T183628

And psychopaths are known for lacking a normal sense of fear, being impulsive, and overconfident in their own ability to fool everyone. So no matter who killed her, it makes perfect sense to me that the person would take the kind of risk associated with the park ""burial"" (more like ""body dump""). It's also possible that two people were involved and both had antisocial personalities. It certainly isn't uncommon for those kind of people to find each other and commit crimes."	20141129T200940

I have done research on psychopaths and joppy77's post is very reasonable based on my understanding and experience. 1-2% of the male population is a lot of people, and their low fear, lack of remorse, and impulsivity (some aren't) are consistent with this crime. Also, it just isn't true that by joppy77's definition, ""every murderer who doesn't fess up to the act is a psychopath."" joppy77 points out psychopath-specific characteristics and doesn't define psychopathy as merely not fessing up."	20141130T153011

spelltrouble	1	0	"Kudos to your research, but the DSM-V still suggests Antisocial/Psychopathic as one of the five categories under Personality Disorders, even though the term isn't recognized as an official title. Sure, you can use it in a non-clinical sense, but I don't think that's what's going on here. It is very much a term that's thrown around a lot by people who have no idea what it means. Having a degree in forensic psychology, I find it troublesome that people keep throwing it around. You can't prove the killer has no sense of remorse and is ""coolly lying under pressure"" when we don't know who the killer is. You can't cite ""low fear"" when you don't know what happened, you can't cite ""impulsivity"" when you don't know if the murder was planned or not. The facts in the case as they've been presented that may apply to the textbook definition of ""psychopath"" (impulsive, overconfident, fearless) can be balanced terms that don't really fit (greed, dropouts, tyranny). And all of these terms might fit with the majority of America's teenagers. I don't think any of this fits this case, and I also don't think anyone here has even a portion of information and experience needed on the available suspects to be able to diagnose or infer these kind of disorders. Listing a bunch of open-ended and vague statements like the ones listed previously doesn't mean they're without criticism, and I think it's dangerous to the comprehension of other cases to infer as much."	20141202T043307

She has promised that she wouldn't 'trump' the Serial team. I'm sure there is a confidentiality agreement. She even had to caution Saad not to say something that would have been a spoiler. If you want to see other documents, you should probably address the Serial producers, rather than acting as if Rabia is deliberately trying to hide stuff just to piss you all off.

therealburndog	4	0	What he talked about in the last episode wasn't a formal interview. Times have changed, but back in '99 there was no recording of preliminary interviews. We know that with Jay there are hours of discussions with police that weren't recorded. I'm not sure that you're going to be satisfied if you find notes or a transcript anyway...it's only going to be the police asking Adnan what happened that day and him saying he doesn't know or doesn't remember. If you think that there's some deep insight or confession that Rabia is deliberately hiding then you're very much mistaken. The whole point re: Adnan is that he has ALWAYS maintained that he doesn't know or doesn't exactly remember. I doubt that he had some freewheeling interview where he rambled on about what happened.	20141130T020801

She wasn't going to see things differently bc a bunch of tools on reddit finished episode 6. Sorry. And how do you even know she's not releasing harmful information? Did you miss the states case episode? Because last time I checked, Rabia released Jay/Jen's statements...those are prosecution witnesses. She gave you the star witness for the prosecutions police statements. Sorry that's harmful enough for you.	20141130T191615

Also, Do you really think theres incriminating police interviews that wouldn't have been heard in ""the case against adnan syed""? I'm pretty sure SK would've revealed something noteworthy.

serialist9	2	0	It makes her less credible if she appears to be slanting information and facts to support what she wants us to believe. I'm not sure why you're having such a strong reaction to this. Rabia has asked for people to pay attention to her, and as such, people are going to form opinions about her credibility based on what she does and doesn't say (as well as how she says it, which I also think has harmed her credibility).	20141201T012408

And you can form as many opinions as you'd like. it's when you act as if she owes you something. Or she needs to prove something to you. Or she's hiding all of this incriminating evidence (that you're making up), that I start to feel icky.

Nutbrowndog	43	0	"I agree with your post. After reading the entire transcript a lot stood out to me. I read it slightly differently--like that Jay was just trash talking back. If he did say he'd help bury the body he regretted it once the crime became real. He states that if he believed someone every time they said they wanted to kill someone else he'd be dead five times over so my take is he didn't really think Adnan was capable until the plan formulated--ie. the night before when Adnan tells Jay he'll give Jay the car so he'll have reason to need a ride from Hae. What strikes me is how Jay says Adnan's demeanor changes. Jay becomes worried and consults Jenn who makes the mistake of telling Jay ""Adnan is just a weird fucking dude."" So now both Jay and Jenn are stuck with foreknowledge after the fact and have to collude to minimize their involvement. This makes the most sense as to motive. Jay--the boy who cries wolf--tells a bunch of people. Everyone thinks it's a story. No one takes it seriously, so when the wolf does show up now Jay has to back track and leave out everyone he told and was in contact with. All I can say is what a terrible, tragic mess. IF only one of those people would have come forward right away with the truth."	20141129T185955

If, as you say, Jay is forensic concious he would still think to wipe them down. This might not occur to him right away though as he is wearing gloves. Once he realizes this he goes back with Jenn to wipe them down. Edit: spelling	20141129T190633

I_W_N_R	4	0	Interesting thoughts on the 12:41 call. One of the big discrepancies between Jay/Adnan's stories is that 11:30 - 1:27 time period. Adnan claims Jay dropped him back at school at 11:30. Jay says it was later than that. Has there been anything else to back either one of them up? Did anyone else confirm seeing Adnan back at school at that time? What did he claim he did during this free period? Does he have an explanation for why, if he was back at school at 11:30, he was over a half-hour late for Psych?	20141129T185019
stiltent	4	0	Great post! This is my wife's theory without the careful examination of casework. I wonder about the conclusion, though. It seems likely, if you follow the call log further, based on who would likely call whom and Jen's testimony about calling Adnan's phone after 7pm--she said an older male voice answered and told her Jay would call her back--that Jay and another co-conspirator buried the body, intentionally at a time when Adnan would have an alibi--delivering food at the mosque. If Jay buried the body without Adnan, there isn't any wiggle room for Jay to claim he only had a small role in the murder and cover-up. Maybe his forensic instincts to throw out his clothes and wipe the shovels were actually pro-tips from an unnamed, dangerous co-conspirator.	20141130T001919

lawnjockjams	8	0	"Three predictions: 1) Stephanie or someone else who knows Jay will talk, and mention being warned to stay away from Adnan because of ""what happened to Hae"" (based on teaser clip from episode one) 2) Jay and Adnan were experimenting with other drugs besides marijuana. In one police interview Jay mentions Adnan looking like he's on LSD (maybe it was a PCP-laced joint?) and in another he mentions ""narcotics"" before correcting himself and saying ""marijuana."" 3) Adnan was in a partially drug-induced dissociative state during the time of the murder. This explains the lack of a strong motive, denial of premeditation, and the confession in episode 9 that he feels somewhat responsible for what happened because of bad ""choices"" he'd made...i.e. if he'd been a ""good muslim"" (his words) this never would have happened"	20141129T234330

juless18	4	0	So Adnan wanted to kill Hae in the middle of the afternoon near the library/high school? This just really makes no sense. That's the issue I see here with your analysis. There is no exact proof that Hae was dead at 2:36. In the last episode of Serial, this friend of Hae's, Summer, even said that Hae was still at school at 2:30-2:45 and that she was talking to her at that time. No one ever really proofed that Hae was killed at that time, it was only what Jay and the State wanted to make everyone believe because that fit their case. Honestly, it's strange to me to see so many people who still think Adnan did this. If Jay knew about Hae's car, if he was the one who disposed of the shovel and clothes, if he was the person who knew anything about the crime - than he would be my number one suspect. (especially because I can't see Adnan being the murderer and letting Jay take care of getting rid of the shovel!? Wtf, that would be the stupidest thing a murderer could do imo) The only reason you (and anyone else) even thought about Adnan being the murderer is the fact that JAY accused him and used his phone and car that day, and that the police saw him as main suspect because he was the last ex-boyfriend (just because of that whole cliché). But other than that, no one would even think of Adnan. It is clear to me that Adnan was stupid in trusting Jay with his phone and car, and Jay later simply pinned everything on Adnan, but he was stupid enough to mess up a lot during his statements. I think people are still fixated on Adnan because of the way SK tells the story, you know, to keep it more interesting. But I'd find it interesting to know more about Jay's relationship with Hae and how Jenn and Hae's relationship was like and what kind of person Jenn was. I think there's something very weird about Jay calling Jenn all the time during this day. And if people think Adnan is guilty just because he didn't call Hae after she went missing, than people should find it also very strange that Jay called Jenn all the time during that day, told her about the crime and didn't even call his girlfriend who he was so worried about because Adnan apparently threatened him about Stephanie (plus, it was her birthday). This is all so strange man, it doesn't even come close to the small things that make Adnan look 'guilty'. I hope Serial dedicates an episode to all that...	20141129T191705
runningwithglasses	2	0	Ive been on the fence as to whether Adnan is guilty/not guilty and this theory sounds plausible. However, one thing is bothering me. If Jay knew where Hae's body was buried, why didn't Jay tell the police where it was. He did show them where her car was parked. Why didn't the police press him for a body? Why didn't Jay just offer to show where the body was?	20141129T192129

Kdubyo	1	0	Jay's reason for participation at all in this heinous crime has really puzzled me but, and this is pure speculation, Adnan could have told Jay that Hae intended to tell Stephanie that Jay was cheating in an effort to rile him up/enlist his help with the disposal of her body...I've never really bought the idea of Jay not having a choice once Adnan shows up with Hae's body, he absolutely still had choices at that point, but if he wasn't too torn up at the time that Hae was no longer in the picture because it spared him the grief she might have caused, that I can buy...it also would explain his present day anger if I'm correct in assuming he and Stephanie did not live happily ever after...looking back 15 yrs later, agreeing to do what he did in effort to maintain his no longer relevant HS relationship would probably (provided he has any sort of conscience) make him feel furious...at himself	20141130T040017

lalalla88	1	0	has anyone wondered if Adnan has some deep psychological traumas due to his very strict upbringing? it shows how the kid was 15 years ago. (going behind parents back, sneaking away to have a relationship, drugs, etc) i keep seeing people say especially his family that he is a nice kid, a straight A-student, he goes to mosque and pray, was prom prince. (latest incident when a homecoming prince, Fryberg, shot at students at a Washington state school, over almost the same reasons, emotional, heart break.) just because adnan might be all these things in the outside, he had some deep core shadows that is practically obvious! that was the motive that the prosecutors got him indicted in the first place. i am listening to the podcast and i am almost done.. on episode 7. from what i am hearing, i haven't heard adnan show any remorse that his ex gf is gone.. not one! all you hear him try to logically defend and make excuses what happened that day. when SK asked him why he did not once try to page his missing gf, he was stumped. all you hear are these lame excuses coming from him. in fact, that is all you hear from him throughout the whole episodes. the guy sounds like a psychopath to me. has anyone put him in psychological treatment? what does the doctors say?	20141224T133109

He didn't, but they were his, so he knew his prints would be all over them just by virtue of having them at his house and moving them around or using them.	20141217T204029
anonymous	36	0	I also agree, especially on your first point. Most people's sense of time is absolutely terrible. Most times, when first screening a case, a witness will not be able to tell me exactly when the crime took place. And this is the victim, only days after the incident! And yet, from 911 calls, police radio runs, surveillance video, etc., I can verify that their best guess is often inaccurate by an hour or more. Why? Well, most of us simply don't have a good sense of time. We don't track its progression well. We constantly under or over-shoot it. And we don't look at our watches incessantly, especially when doing something that we don't think to be important at the time. We might remember the time of day, and thereby can approximate about when something happened, but it's bound to be inaccurate. Even if you do think something is important, unless you're looking at your watch right as its happening, it's amazing how easily people lose track of time when you're speaking to them weeks or months after the fact. It's not uncommon that, when speaking to a witness who filed a report months ago resulting in a recent arrest, they may not remember at all when the crime occurred - just that it happened in the fall, or sometime after school let out! If you want a comparison, think of a day that's very important to you - your wedding day, or your graduation, or a funeral - whatever. Those are very important days. But can you recall every phone call you made and every place you went and every time you arrived at those locations on those days, with any degree of accuracy? Of course not. But somehow we expect the same from victims and witnesses, even though we recognize that, for them, this was only one day in their life, and that they just want to get on with their lives and move past what happened (for most.) So while I can certainly believe that Jay may have lied or mis-remembered non-essential portions of his testimony, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the vast majority of the inconsistencies in his testimony arise from the same place that gives birth to inconsistencies in most cases - the inherent fallibility of human memory with respect to time and the compounding effect of being questioned over and over and over at different points in time about the same events.	20141129T204333

My problem is with the cops. It seems to me that the cops would have seen Jay and thought, ""Oh here's this black dude, slightly shady, deals a little bit of dope (and maybe slings a bit of rock) - case closed!"" But they didn't. I really thought from the start that Jay was almost perfect for this (and maybe that's what Adnan thought too). But perhaps the cops actually worked through the convolutions of this thing and came to the correct conclusion...? I don't know, I oscillate wildly like most of us. I'm not trying to reach a certainty because that's probably impossible. I still think that there was insufficient evidence to send Adnan to prison forever, but I am (at this moment) leaning toward him being guilty."	20141129T234503

truth-seekr	24	0	After reading the transcripts i kind of wonder if the Jay and Jenn SK talks to us about in the podcast might be completey different people. The Jenn from the transcript seems a like any other teenager. Its pretty obvious how she was conflicted about notifying the police Vs making true to her promise to Jay to keep the secret. Her remorse about what happened is earnest. Plus, her account is consistent and she obviously wants to come clean with everything she knows about the case at that moment. Another thing why i am critical about how SK represented Jenns testimony: SK always emphasized that according to Jenn's statement, Jay did not leave her house until 3.45 pm and how that doesn't make sense with the states time-line. If you read the transcript, Jenn actually does not pinpoint the moment when Jay left her house to 3.45pm. At one point she says it was BETWEEN 2.30 to 3.45 pm. This account of time-line is consistent with the state's theory. Another important moment for me in the transcript was when she stated that after the guy who found Hae's body became a suspect, Jay told her that they could not allow for the wrong person to go down for the murder. Considering how Jay is always painted as a to the bone bad character by Rabia and the other Adnan evangelists, this is telling a very different story.	20141129T184434
EsperStormblade	14	0	I think one reason this is hard to figure out is that there are a couple of incorrect assumptions we are making--like the assumption that Jay and Adnan were not together at 12:41. This makes Jay look like more of a liar than he is...and, it seems to be entirely wrong based upon the information I re-presented here. I wonder how many other erroneous assumptions about the day are operating to obfuscate what really happened here?	20141129T181631

anonymous	4	0	In Jay's second interview, he mentions that Adnan wanted to get back to his next class, so that he wouldn't be missed from school. I don't know about that, but what seems almost certain is that Adnan did not get back to school until 1:27pm. Jay at Jenns: it is very plausible that he did not go back. But, remember, he needs to tell the cops that he was *nowhere near* Adnan when this murder occurred.	20141129T203448
EsperStormblade	4	0	Nothing these kids did was logical, lol. And, Jay says he was playing video games with Jenn's brother for about an hour and an hour and a half before he got another call. So from 1:20 to 2:30 is exactly that time frame. He also indicates that it takes him approximately 5 minutes or less to get from Jenn's house to the HS, which would be the same for the Best Buy.	20141129T183503

MusicCompany	10	0	I think the OP is saying Adnan called Jay at 2:36 from a public phone at the library (where Adnan has presumably just killed Hae), and that Jay was already at the Best Buy.	20141129T182815

He saw her in the evening, and Stephanie testified that he told her to stay away from Adnan.	20141129T192635
anonymous	23	0	> it's strange to me to see so many people who still think Adnan did this I have to say that the more information that comes to light (to me), the more I become convinced that Adnan strangled Hae to death. This seems to be true of others too. (Not everyone I know!)	20141129T204220
anonymous	17	0	**If Jay knew about Hae's car, if he was the one who disposed of the shovel and clothes, if he was the person who knew anything about the crime - than he would be my number one suspect** All the more reason it'd be baffling that he'd tell Jen to tell the cops to send them his way and eventually divulge his take on events if he did it, because if Adnan had an iron-clad alibi, Jay would be TOTALLY fucked. **that the police saw him as main suspect because he was the last ex-boyfriend (just because of that whole cliché)** Male on female violence in intimate relationships and post-breakup is a real-life issue--not a literary plot.	20141129T214712

EsperStormblade	21	0	I never said Hae was dead at 2:36. And, the prevalence of ex BFs committing intimate murder is not a cliche...it's a fact. The rest of what you've written here doesn't address what I actually wrote about in my post so...	20141129T192106
anonymous	5	0	> And if people think Adnan is guilty just because he didn't call Hae after she went missing I posted this in another thread, but I too was stuck on why Adnan didn't call Hae after learning she was missing. And I've come up with two theories: 1) AFAIK The police never checked the logs of Hae's pager (or at the very least, the pager is now lost and no records exist of the logs). We cannot not for sure that Adnan didn't page her from another source, we only know he never used his cell phone to contact her. He also couldn't have called her at home because then her parents would find out about their previous relationship. Also, who calls the home of someone who's been reported missing? 2) This is speculation on my part, but it's possible that during their last conversation the night before, Hae might have asked Adnan to stop contacting her. Maybe things were going well with Don, maybe Don was getting jealous, maybe Adnan was being clingy, maybe her parents were getting suspicious. For whatever reason she might have told him to back off for a bit. I'm not entirely convinced of Adnan's innocence, but my gut feeling is that Jay killed Hae, and somehow involved Adnan in the cover up.	20141129T221551

anonymous	5	0	I think the Serial Staff know what is up. They are telling the story of their investigation, not what they currently think. More than likely they will find a bunch more circumstantial evidence but not find definitive proof so it will be open to interpretation.	20141129T210053
EsperStormblade	3	0	Hmm, that has never been brought up anywhere--and, it's in neither of Jay's statements that we have available. I wonder if this is correct; bc Jay asserts repeatedly that he was never in Hae's car.	20141216T215047
partymuffell	11	0	The fact that he still proclaims his innocence has no evidential significance. Adnan tried his luck by going to trial. He probably thought he could charm the jury and win the trial (and anyway he didn't have much to lose as the prosecutors wouldn't have cut him a particularly good deal once they had secured Jay's testimony), but he miscalculated and lost. He kept maintaining his innocence and this ensured his family and his supporters are still on his side, which led to this podcast. Not too bad an outcome for such a reckless strategy.	20141129T234031
EsperStormblade	18	0	You are hanging your own theory on the notion that it is illogical for Adnan to maintain his innocence? I'm sorry, but *that* doesn't make sense. Plenty of people, who are guilty, maintain their innocence. By admitting he and Jay did it together, he still goes to jail with no chance of appeal or ever being seen as innocent. Sure, Jay goes to jail too but he sinks his own chance to be exonerated. So maintaining his innocence is the smart thing to do, given that it's the only route that allows for him to one day be free (or to have been exonerated in the first place).	20141129T190423

Once the conviction verdict is in, his chance of cooperating and coming clean are OVER. It's too late to go down that path. His chance was gone.

(I'm extrapolating here--you'll have to read it for yourself to see if that's what you read from it.) Jenn says that Adnan is just ""a weird fucking dude"" i.e., 'don't worry about it.'

JADEN: It’s proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe. It’s relative to beings and other places. But on the level of being here on earth, if you are aware in a moment, one second can last a year. And if you are unaware, your whole childhood, your whole life can pass by in six seconds. But it’s also such a thing that you can get lost in. WILLOW: Because living. JADEN: Right, because you have to live. There’s a theoretical physicist inside all of our minds, and you can talk and talk, but it’s living. WILLOW: It’s the action of it.	20141129T212311

Stanislawiii	2	0	Actually, that's what's weird about the whole deal. He is extremely specific about which cars, whether or not she had shoes, and exactly how many shovels they had. Now if what he says is true, he's disposing of a dead body at the spur of the moment, and he is taking in a lot of details for someone in the middle of what should be a fairly traumatic event (burying someone a friend of yours just murdered). I say that because of an experiment/demonstration done in a psych class I took. A girl (who I knew actually), came in and had an argument with the teacher (confederates, obviously), and then we were asked to describe what she looked like. And the descriptions as well as the sequence of the event varied pretty wildly between members of the class, and almost no one was accurate. It's just not, to my mind, possible that if the same groups of people participated in what they thought was disposal of a recently murdered corpse, that the details would be more accurate, in fact, I'd predict them to be less accurate.	20141207T220439

themdeadeyes	6	0	Your theory is awesome and I think this piece of evidence *really* swings things in favor of Jay.

anonymous	7	0	This seems like such an important detail -- I'm surprised it wasn't actually mentioned in the podcast. After reading the transcripts of the interviews and seeing the Serial timeline, I feel like the strengths of Jay's account have been downplayed by SK, while the weaknesses have been given center stage. I wonder if the tide will change in future episodes.	20141130T032617
MusicCompany	1	0	And, when SK presses him, he remembers the call from the police, but that seems to be the end of his memory. > Sarah Koenig Something pretty unusual did happen to you that day. Which was… Adnan Syed Oh like the police, the police call... Sarah Koenig The police call! [Calling to] say, “do you know where Hae Lee is?”, right? Adnan Syed Oh no, uh, I do remember that phone call and I do remember being high at the time because the craziest thing is to be high and have the police call your phone. I’ll never forget that.	20141207T014714
EnsignCrunch	21	0	I'm also surprised SK didn't mention how late Adnan was to psychology class. 5-10 minutes is one thing, but he was almost 40 minutes late according to the teacher's notes. In my experience it's rare for anyone to be that late. At that point it's half over and you might as well just skip it entirely. Seems worth mentioning if you've spent a year obsessing over the timeline of that one day.	20141129T233137
Stumpytailed	13	0	"I had a similar reaction to reading Jenn's transcript. It seems like Jenn arrives at the 3:45 time because she is ""walking back"" her day in her mind, and trying to add up the facts and may or may not have it right. She knows she left her house at 4:15 to pick up her parents and Jay was gone by then. She knows Jay was waiting for a call to come in around 3:30 (supposedly- I'd be curious is she actually remembers this stated time from that day or if it was filled in later by Jay). From there she deduces a time line. It is entirely possible she doesn't know the exact time Jay was at her house, but is piecing it together the best she can (for ex: maybe he left earlier). I also found the fact that they heard about Mr. S as a suspect at the time very intriguing."	20141129T193515

If he really did plan it, that puts the call in a whole other, super creepy, light.	20141129T200241

It's just contradictory to me that he said he helped Adnan with this whole murder because Adnan threatened Stephanie, but then he didn't try to make sure she was okay. Like to me, the reason why Jay even helped Adnan is just so strange - honestly, if he wasn't that concerned about Adnan hurting Stephanie, then why help him with a murder? Who does that?? If he was scared that Adnan would hurt Stephanie, then he would try harder to contact Stephanie or someone who was with her to make sure she was okay. But maybe he wasn't that concerned. But then why even help Adnan?? It doesn't make sense to me.	20141130T203811
anonymous	17	0	My theory is that the sub has become more and more polarized, and that whats happening is that we're basically two subs inside one.

juless18	3	0	I've seen some polls and the majority of people who aren't lawyers (41%) think Adnan ISN'T guilty, and some 30 something % were still undecided... I think it's easier for people to think that he's guilty, than to accept the fact that police fucked up and put a decent, innocent person in jail. I mean, that thought IS pretty depressing. But I do think Adnan's innocent, and that it was either Jay or that rapist who strangled another Asian girl from Baltimore around the same time of Hae's death.	20141130T202627
Dr__Nick	14	0	Yes. People need to realize that Jay accusing Adnan of murder while maintaining his own innocence is very different from what Jay actually did- implicating himself in that most serious crime in order to implicate Adnan.

EnsignCrunch	3	0	Annan doesn't contest not calling her. He tells SK that like many of her other friends he didn't believe Hae was in real trouble until several days later, by which point he was getting his info from other friends. Another poster who went through something similar said that this could be normal behavior if Adnan didn't think she was in trouble until the authorities were handing it, at which point it would be moot. Still seems fishy to me.	20141130T022610
therealjjohnson	2	0	If Hae was missing, where exactly would Adnan call? Hae didn't have a cell phone. Does one call the parents of a missing girl and ask for her everyday? The same parents that he has been trying to hide the fact that he calls there at all to? Seems weird.	20141130T154151
juless18	1	0	I think Hae didn't have a cell phone, only a pager. And I totally agree with you - we don't know if he contacted her from another pager or from a friends phone and also, his friends were all trying to contact her and they saw each other at school and would talk about it (if she had answered or not). Plus, they had just broken up and he knew she was in another relationship, so maybe he didn't want to bother her. To me, that isn't really that suspicious.	20141130T201644

I mean, this jerk is going to get up and give away the only thing I have, my innocence.” This is one of the only times, in the podcast at least, that Adnan expresses any sort of rage so it stood out to me.

I don't see any self-respecting high school senior boy having red wool gloves with leather palms. Were they Hae's? If so, wouldn't her friends know about them? I knew all my friends' major accessories. Sounds dumb, but I still remember who had which purse, sunglasses, wallet, etc. Those things are important to high school girls.

When he realized that Adnan had gone trough with it (trunk pop) - it was already too late for him to back down since he at that point had become an accessory. Other than that Jay has serious issues with keeping a record of time (which is no wonder considering he was constantly high). And - aside from showing very poor judgement with Adnan - Jay's moral compass seems to be quite intact (trying to leave out his friends, not wanting S. to be framed for the murder, encouraging Jenn to talk to the police and to send them to him afterwards)."	20141129T200546
EsperStormblade	5	0	Yes, I agree with this. I think once it happened, though, Jay freaked out--on multiple levels.	20141129T182612
Nutbrowndog	7	0	Jenn had to assist Jay because like Jay, she miscalculated--thinking Adnan was just all talk. As Jay's confidante she counseled him wrong--Adnan is just a weird dude, etc. Thus she got herself into the mess of also having to cover her foreknowledge and act like she only knew after the fact.	20141129T190656
anonymous	1	0	and Jay rang Adnan that evening too ...	20141129T203020
therealjjohnson	1	0	Im wondering how he called her. By that i mean, they had a really elaborate way to contact each other right? Hae would have to call information and then click over so her parents didn't here the phone ring. So he paged her first? These calls were at midnight ish right? Can just call her house randomly at midnight. SO he had to page her, she make a call, then he call his phone. And this happened twice. I wonder what that call was about.	20141130T012044
LUNABELLA123	4	0	But according to Ep. 9, Hae was still in the gym talking to her friend Summer until almost 3:00. So maybe he flagged her down near the library after that and killed her? In which case, not sure what the 2:36 call is about. Maybe it isn't even from Adnan? Could that call have been from someone else entirely?	20141129T185408
MisoSoup	1	0	Hang on. You say that Hae was dead by 2.35 pm. But doesn't at least one other witness see her closer to 3.00 pm? (Really good analyses btw.)	20141129T194556

batutah	6	0	I completely agree with you on this. I have not been on reddit very long and really haven't commented that much, but I am noticing that the threads are starting to look like echo chambers. What is especially interesting to me is how folks can look at the exact same evidence and interpret it so differently. I lean pretty heavily towards Adnan's innocence (don't know what the hell I'm doing on *this* thread, btw) and I am always surprised that folks will interpret things that I think point to his innocence as pointing to his guilt. But of course, now no one is really debating those points with anyone that disagrees with them...they are just agreeing with those who are likeminded.	20141130T014051

It has happened before many times, with the death penalty too, and unfortunately it will happen again, due to police corruption, and a whole host of reasons. Here, though, as of right now, I am satisfied that the person who strangled Hae to death is in prison where he should be. And I understand that you don't agree and I respect that. Regarding polls .. I really shudder to think what Hae's family think of this Serial thing. But ... I await the release of further information/evidence.	20141201T083440

Adnan, as most every other incarcerated individuals..ends up blaming their lawyer for insufficient representation or not bringing in some minuscule piece of exculpatory evidence...that's what you MUST to do to get an appeal granted. My son was working as an attorney for these type of appeals (full time...getting good money, plus benefits,) and could NOT stand it...people in jail in some states have unlimited opportunities for this type of appeal..(even people who confessed and drew a map to the murder weapon!) .... .BTW the best news is that ALL at the costs of BOTH sides of the appeal go to....guess who...the taxpayers ..	20141203T221617

JoeyPockets	1	0	I just read a thread speculating that she paged him late that night. He called back listening for the call waiting tone and hanging up when he didn't hear it, that's why they were calls only lasting 2 seconds. By the third call she was waiting on the other line with an 800 number so that the phone wouldn't ring out loud, that's when they finally spoke for 90 seconds or so. By then it's after 12:30am and too late to talk. He says okay, here's my new cell #, see you tomorrow.	20141202T013917

I'm just not actually interested in debating that kind of stuff anymore, and really actually, what brought me to the sub in the first place was wanting to talk about it on a more meta level.

anonymous	2	0	I was confused about his attorney making that statement at sentencing. What was the purpose of it? He'd already been convicted, and the crime had a mandatory sentence of life. Could arguing that it was not premeditated have made any difference at that point?	20141129T195714
anonymous	10	0	Sort of. If he admitted his guilt he wouldn't be able to appeal, and he said as much, that he planned to appeal >Adnan explains several things about this. First, he wasn’t especially nervous right then. That was about to change, but at that point he says that he was thinking of his sentencing as a procedure he needed to get through so he could immediately start the appeals process. I think it was just a gamble he was willing to take. He thought he'd be found not guilty, and then when he was found guilty, he still believed that he could be exonerated probably because people started telling him he had a chance at appealing due to ineffective council. Mostly I think it's hard to discern anything meaningful from his maintaining innocence, and the fact can be used to support whatever story you have in mind.	20141129T193321

FeelinGarfunkelly	14	0	If Jay is to be believed, Adnan returns to the important places. Returns to Best Buy, where they allegedly had sex and where Adnan allegedly killed Hae. Then, Adnan wants to return to the burial site at Leakin Park (maybe does it on his own to put the rocks on Hae's body?) But I still think it's possible that Adnan returning to Best Buy could have been an act of mourning, going to a place that held meaning to them. Having lost important people in my life, as I think a lot of us have, certain places start taking on special meaning. It just so happens that Adnan's placement of that meaning is particularly damning.	20141129T194034

If you break down Jay's statements, like the Detective said, it's not hard to see how he minimizes his involvement, protects other people, hides other crimes, makes himself seem sympathetic, makes Adnan seem calculating, etc. Combine that with the average person's inability to remember time accurately and you get a very messy, inconsistent statement. But that doesn't mean literally every thing that comes out of Jay's mouth is a lie. That's a very black and white way of looking at it. I don't think that blog post does a good job of examining the nuances of this case.	20141129T235307

goliath_franco	8	0	"It's polemic. It's not an open consideration of the evidence, even though it is quite long and detailed. Just browsing the linked post, here are a few problems: > Now, it’s possible that Adnan is still guilty of Hae’s murder, and that the state managed to get the right guy, even if they didn’t have much to go on. Possible. This suggests that there's little or no evidence linking Adnan to the murder. But that's not the case. Jay volunteers testimony that Adnan is the killer, even when volunteering that information puts Jay at risk of a long prison sentence. Cell phone records (especially the Nisha call and pings later in the evening) place Adnan with Jay during key points of the day, corroborating Jay's version of events. (Jay didn't know cell phone records would be used to check his version of events, so I don't think we can say he planned that.) And so on. It's not like there's no evidence against Adnan. There is evidence. We can question the evidence and Jays' credibility, but I don't see how it all can just be dismissed out of hand. > there was simply no objective basis for believing that Jay was likely to tell the truth when he testified at Adnan’s trial. I'm not sure what ""objective"" means here, but there are definitely reasons to believe that Jay is telling the truth. Again, we can question Jay's credibility, but we can't dismiss his credibility out of hand. What did he gain by implicating himself in this crime? He *volunteered* information to the police. There *are* reasons to think that Jay was trying to do the right thing after having done the wrong thing. > We know that Jay had every motivation to lie and no motivation to the tell the truth How do we *know* that Jay had every motivation to lie?

Cabin11	4	0	Well Jay does say in one of his testimonies that he owed Adnan money. I think he borrowed $150, and had only paid back $50 of the debt at the time of the interview. Adnan could have offered to forgive the debt in exchange for Jay's help. Sounds positively rotten, but it's a theory.	20141130T015036
Nutbrowndog	1	0	Read Jay's entire police interview transcribed and see where you can find that Jay admits to being paid to help. That's the real source, not this document which hopes to drum up an appeal. Page 10 is not quoting an actual transcript or tape, it's just making a statement that has no basis in fact.	20141129T193007
bugelman	4	0	Right, so the attorney submitting the brief to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals is just making up new information that has no basis in fact and isn't founded, at the risk of losing his law license. Um, no. It seems Jay did say he was paid to assist Adnan in his third statement, but since we don't have the third statement transcript, we don't know the exact wording of whatever he told the investigator. But it would seem likely that Jay only said this in the third interview -- if he had been more consistent in the other police interviews about being paid, I would imagine we would have heard of it by now and it would be a larger part of the general narrative here. As far as we know, the prosecution didn't offer testimony at trial from Jay about having been paid for his role as helper, so I would presume that they didn't pursue this line of questioning because it was just another inconsistent statement by Jay that wouldn't help their case. If you do want something factual to dig into, you might look up on the Maryland Case Judiciary web search page Jay's multiple arrests for domestic violence incidents, the peace order that resulted from one of them or his arrest for assaulting a law enforcement officer.	20141129T200026

funkiestj	2	0	Jay lying doesn't make Adnan innocent. Jay changing his story every time (lying) should make us give his testimony less weight. If Jay sticks to the same story each interview (i.e. doesn't change variables that have nothing to do with minimizing his role -- like the trunk pop location) then this story is not the subject of season 1 of serial. His unreliability is why we are unsure of Adnan's guilt. That and why the fuck the po po didn't test for DNA on the bottle and tons of ther evidence.	20141130T052808

Whatever I manage to dig up. Like I said before you can call it whatever you want. Call it good police work, call it corruption. I've made up my mind. Are you afraid people will read it and start to wonder what's going on in the great emerald city behind the curtain? Go ahead and throw out more mud to try and discredit anyone questioning them.

JudoChop82	17	0	If Adcock had not told Syed that Hae did not pick up her cousin and simply that she was missing, I think Syed's response is plausible. Maybe he thought that she had run off somewhere after dropping her cousin off. If Adcock had told Syed about Hae not picking up her cousin, Syed's response does seem suspicious to me. Syed knows that she is very responsible about such things. So his only thinking that Hae's going to be trouble doesn't add up in my opinion. If a responsible person suddenly without apparent reason shirked her responsibilities, a giant red flag should have gone off much like how Aisha responded. I doubt we can get a definitive answer to what exactly Adcock said to Syed at this point.	20141129T213322
stiltent	32	0	I missed something. Where's the discrepancy? I don't see one. He says his thought after the police phone call was that Hae's gonna be in big trouble with her mom. If you take the excerpt from ep. 9, and compare dead to trouble with mom, I would say that makes whatever he thought might have happened to her look like nothing and would precipitate the shock he describes experiencing. His statement about Hae always picking up her cousin, no matter what, is then explained by Adnan thinking Hae is going to be in big trouble at home when he gets the calls about her missing. For me, that's a loop free of discrepancy. I don't see how this moves the ball in any direction unless you apply your bias. If I apply the opposite bias, that Adnan is innocent, it all adds up: he knows she takes family obligations seriously and that shirking them would upset her mother; the police call makes him worried for her not about her; complete shock that she was murdered. If you want to prove he's guilty, this is only an insignificant part of the theory.	20141130T004626
joppy77	18	0	My intuition alarm bells have always gone off about how Adnan reacted to Hae's disappearance. They had only recently broken up from one of those typical intense high school relationships, he was still calling her up until the day she went missing, and he fully understood her personality and patterns. I know all of the info about her previous mentions of California, and how supposedly *everyone* else was reacting the same way as Adnan. But it just doesn't ring true. He had the cops calling him the *day the disappeared*. She abandoned her cousin. She dropped out of her entire life, her 4.0 GPA, well-planned future... took none of her belongings and contacted no family and *no friends* (this last part is very telling for a teenage girl, I think). Other than someone who is being seriously abused at home or has serious mental illness, who does that? How can that be shrugged off in the slightest? Obviously there *were* people who were freaking out, or else the police wouldn't have acted in such a quick manner. I'd bet anything that she had friends who were very concerned, too, despite what Adnan and some of his supporters have said about how calm everyone was. I just can't imagine that this so-called conscientious and good young man would never even call her, never get upset (prior to her being found), and just never show serious concern. It just doesn't add up, no matter how people couch it. In my opinion, his behavior was consistent with so many other guilty people; kind of going on with life as if there was nothing happening... move along, no bizarre disappearance to see here! I don't know what to think about the overall case, but Adnan seems to reek of guilt, just like Jay. But I definitely wouldn't convict Adnan based on intuition, not even in the little court inside my mind.	20141129T232410

pennyparade	5	0	Thank you for this post. Very pertinent, IMO. So many people are analyzing Jay's statement to death because it's more exciting to 'catch' the guy who isn't in prison while Adnan's explanations are largely ignored.

yamahamg	5	0	The thing here is, Adnan knows that she always picks up her cousin and that she's serious about it, and would never not do it for any reason, which means that she would immediately be missed when she didn't show up. It's the absolute worst time to commit this crime. So, if he did it(I'd like to believe he is innocent, but, you know, umm, it's hard to believe), I can't see why he would have planned it that way ahead of time.	20141130T010923

ricofata	2	0	The episode 9 quote you gave wasn't from when Hae went missing, it was from when they found Hae's body. You are comparing two different situations, Adnan's first talking about the day she went missing, then he's talking about the day she is found. Completely reasonable to be shocked when her body is found compared to finding out she's missing. Reading through your response again I realize it's not these two quotes you are comparing. Sorry!	20141129T222120
nautilus2000	2	0	Am I the only one that doesn't think Adnan's reactions are abnormal? He got a call from the police after Hae had been missing for only a few hours. She's an 18 year old senior in high school who just started seeing a new guy. She's never been truthful with her parents about her whereabouts. Sure, she's usually responsible, but as an 18 year old who's in a new relationship, it wouldn't at all be surprising that she forgot to pick up her cousin once. She's not a grown up picking up her son--missing that would be very troubling. She's a teenager. In fact if I were innocent Adnan and got that call I might be kinda happy--I'd assume that she was going to get in to lots of trouble because she went to see her new guy. In fact, it seems like many people, including some of her close friends and family members, thought she had run off to California. Obviously, when innocent Adnan found out that she was dead it was a complete shock. It's completely different to find out that she's dead than that she's been missing for 3 hours. And as for the statement about not asking for a ride...well if you know someone is usually busy at a certain time, it makes sense that you wouldn't ask them for a favor at that time. That doesn't mean that you would be in complete shock if that person one day didn't do that task that they usually do everyday.	20141130T042816

Hae's brother, Aisha and the cops call; I put my thoughts together in a logical fashion, and suddenly I realize that Hae not picking up her cousin means something terrible might have happened. Now say I'm baked out of my mind. The cops call--and I'm all, fuck the cops and I'm stoned--and they're like, ""When was the last time you saw your ex? Because her mom is concerned that she hasn't heard from her. Do you know where she might be? She hasn't called home and her mom is freaking out about it, so we're just trying to figure out where she might have gone."" And I would probably laugh, baked out of my mind, at how much trouble Hae is in with her mother. When Adnan recalls this memory, it seems very believable to me--like anyone would remember an important moment that happened when he was high as a kite. If you do smoke pot, take 10 days off for the super holy stretch of Ramadan, and on the last day, smoke a blunt and have someone tell you your ex might have run away to California, but no one knows for sure. Don't forget to hit record so you can evaluate your reaction later."	20141202T181155

Why was this the only possibility he considered?

EnsignCrunch	0	0	I know that one day isn't necessarily representative (especially when he just got his first cell phone) but the call log for his phone has 34 calls on it, many less than a minute. It seems like these kids are calling each other all the time, even just for a few seconds to check in or say they're leaving, arriving, etc... Krista and Nisha are each called 3 times. He called Hae three times just to give her his number. It's the contrast between the constant communication that seems to be the norm, and the sudden total lack of it that makes it stand out. That said, it's hard to get a sense of what it means because we don't have phone records from a longer period.

Adnan is being deliberately misleading here. 2) The ride is the key to the whole thing. For him to say he wouldn't ask for a ride because he had his own car, when we know that Jay had the car, is again evidence of him lying. One thing to remember about Adnan: he was a practiced liar by this time. He lied to his parents regularly about dating Hae and smoking pot. What kinds of things did he tell them to account for his time? We know, for example, that Hae and Adnan would pretend that Hae was hanging out with Aisha when she was really with Adnan. (And please don't jump down my throat about this comment; I know lots of teenagers lie to their parents. I lied to my parents too. But we have to let go of this naive belief that Adnan couldn't possibly be lying.)	20141129T231135

She just didn't show up. And she was known by everyone, Adnan included, for being responsible. This wasn't a vague, hey, do you know where Hae is? we haven't seen her type of call.	20141129T205909

MusicCompany	1	0	The jump from not showing up to murder, maybe not. But the jump from not showing up to car accident, car breakdown, health emergency, definitely. Why would anyone be *certain* that Hae's disappearance was trivial? Certainty occurs in the presence of knowledge; otherwise, you have uncertainty, and uncertainty is an unstable situation. When you have uncertainty, you seek information. You call people. You ask questions.	20141129T235053
anonymous	3	0	..but *you* believe that *Adnan* believed she may have runaway after going to school for the day(why would she bother to go to school if she was gonna run away anyways?!), with some fries and juice, with the clothes on her back, with a few bucks in her account, in an unreliable car, thousands of miles heading into bad weather, and meanwhile leave a little 6 year old kid, her mom, brother and best friends hanging without even an explanation?!?! ..I can't tell who would have to be more naive,.. Adnan for believing Hae ran away or you for believing that Adnan believed that. Yikes!	20141130T191334
MusicCompany	1	0	We know that Adnan had just talked to Hae at last period (ending 2:15), right before she was supposed to pick up the cousin. If she weren't going to pick up her cousin and was planning to run off to Cali, wouldn't she have mentioned something to him? Wouldn't she have been acting different? We know that she didn't plan to go to California. She was planning to pick up her cousin, meet up with Don (who she had just written in her diary that she was in love with--would she really have bailed right after writing this?), and going to the wrestling meet. We KNOW this. So there is no reason Adnan would have had any indication she was going to take off across the country. It's a lie. He's lying.	20141201T162829
ravonin	7	0	"I don't think you can simply write it off as ""oh boy, Hae's getting in trouble with her mother."" My understanding of Hae, as driven by SK's portrait of her, is a person who is genuinely morally responsible. Thus, she isn't the type of person who does what she does just so she doesn't get repercussions (say, in trouble with her parents), rather she does them because she cares not to hurt the people who have hopes for her. And Adnan of all people would know this. Let's take Adnan's statement seriously: ""She took that very seriously."" You have to reconcile this with the fact that she didn't turn up or even give her relatives a call. So first off, it's reasonable that Hae's missing her pick-up appointment would be very out of character, according to Adnan himself. Thus, secondly, this should be triggering alarm bells in Adnan's mind. I don't see how he can just be fobbing it off as some type of ""Hae gonna do what Hae gonna do"", because that just isn't what Hae does. Naturally, it's possible to assume that Adnan knew a Hae that is different from how SK paints her. But if this is true, then we have to go back to his statement of ""She took that very seriously."" So there's a contradiction, and it's somewhat troubling."	20141130T025227

peetnice	3	0	I also lied to my parents regularly because they were strict. But I lied to almost nobody else- I wouldn't think of lying to my friends, and I would probably make a lousy liar to strangers. But I knew my parents intimately, so it was easy to know what they expect/believe and what they don't. At the time I thought I was a totally respectable kid, who just had the unfortunate hassle of working around some strict rules- my friends didn't have the same rules, so I figured they were unfair and I was totally justified in keeping my parents out of the loop. TLDR - Lying to parents is different than lying to almost everyone else in the world on many levels.	20141130T015836
anonymous	1	0	> we have to let go of this naive belief that Adnan couldn't possibly be lying I don't think most people have that belief. Clearly he was dishonest in a number of ways. The question is whether there's enough information to conclude that he was also capable of strangling Hae Lee. The only thing he's said or not said so far that seems off is this stuff about (1) I asked her for a ride but I got hung up and she had to go, and (2) I would never ask her for a ride because everybody who knew her knew that she always had to pick up her cousin. The first is from the cop's notes, the second from the tape on the show. For me, that's it. That's the only contradiction out of his mouth that makes me go, hmmmmm. When I put it next to all the crazy switcheroo things that his accusers have said, it's not a hard call to decide who's more believable. But I wish I could resolve it.	20141129T235305

MusicCompany	2	0	My point is that the California theory doesn't address the immediate event that triggered concern. Hae didn't call and say she couldn't pick up her cousin or give anyone a reason why she would be detained. When you start running out of hope that you'll hear from someone, sometimes you start making up outlandish stories--she's in California, yeah, that's the ticket--to make yourself feel better. But deep down, you're scared and worried, and you're trying to find that person.	20141129T212555
MusicCompany	4	0	If Hae did go to California and see her father, then it would be easy to check with him. Surely they called her father and asked about Hae. The California scenario also doesn't explain why Hae wouldn't respond to Aisha or anyone else's pages.	20141129T213652
MusicCompany	1	0	In fact, Hae did not intend to move to California. She was in love with Don. She was invested in family and school and extracurricular activities. So there would not be evidence back then indicating that she did intend to move. I'm not sure you understand my point.	20141201T173850

Also if Hae was having problems with her mother, then her friends could have seen Hae not picking up her cousin as her sticking it to her mother. Who knows?

anonymous	1	0	No I do not understand your point. My point is that someone's normal reaction isn't immediately to assume someone has been murdered.

But when someone disappears when they were supposed to be doing something, then people think something is wrong (accident or other emergency). The California thing is such a red herring. I've told people I've considered moving to California. But if I suddenly disappear one day on my way to pick up a child, on a day in which I have several things scheduled, and people assume I must have gone to California on a whim because I once mentioned it a couple of times, I'm going to be really pissed off."	20141201T180147
MusicCompany	1	0	But she didn't! They called Don. He hadn't seen her.	20141201T180238
asha24	6	0	No they wanted to know where she was, a normal reaction, someone doesn't show up at school, you call/text them where are you. Maybe they did grow concerned as time passed, but this doesn't point to some huge contradiction in what Adnan said, since we know for certain people thought she had run away, and this was not some rumour Adnan made up.	20141129T214611
asha24	5	0	Yeah you're right I worded it incorrectly, what I meant to say was that from everything we've heard none of her close friend's were thinking that she was in danger/hurt.	20141129T215135

Also none of her other close friends assumed that she had been murdered. Everyone knew something was seriously wrong but I don't think anyone could have imagined what was to follow. So please, let's not try to dissect Adnan's behavior after Hae's disappearance to find something incriminating there.

MusicCompany	4	0	"Well, Adnan didn't have that ""normal reaction."" Sure, rumors spread around about where she could be. But Hae did not pick up her cousin at 3:15. She left a 5-year-old child waiting at school without telling a soul that she wouldn't be there to pick the child up. This is completely out of character for her. And the person who was one of her closest friends, who *knew* how important it was for her to pick up this child, dismissed this as not a concern at all."	20141129T224545
MusicCompany	4	0	Well, they didn't *know*. Who knows what thoughts crossed their minds? Not knowing something is an incredibly powerful motivation. We're all here on this sub, debating all this stuff, because we don't *know* what happened. When you don't know something and it matters to you, you overturn rocks trying to figure it out. It bothers you. It gets under your skin. However, when you do know, that compulsion to learn never grips you. You can go about your life. What gets me about Adnan is my sense that he knew. His reaction is that of someone who knows something, not of someone who is searching for truth/hope/evidence.	20141129T234101
MusicCompany	1	0	If Adnan had had a different response, I would evaluate on its own merits. I know that this is speculation about someone's state of mind. I can't know what really went through Adnan's mind any more than you can. But we can cross-check what someone says against other things they have said, against other evidence, against what they have said or done in the past, and against what a reasonable person would have done/said. I don't know enough about Adnan calling the detectives to form an opinion on it. It's likely useless either way, per Jim Trainum's statement.	20141201T183942
MusicCompany	1	0	If he didn't know, it's certainly a question he could have asked. I think he actually did suggest that Hae might be with Don (don't have the quote in front of me, but I think it's in the podcast). If he was concerned about Don, Adnan could have followed up on this. And, if he was indeed (over)protective of Hae as once asserted, it seems like he should have followed up, either by questioning Don directly or asking other people about him. Instead, Adnan says that his main reaction was thinking that Hae would get in trouble with her mother.	20141201T184442
asha24	7	0	Again I think you're jumping to conclusions. First of all we don't know the exact details that were given to Adnan, was he told specifically that Hae didn't pick up her cousin? That information isn't given to us so again this is speculation. Police don't usually go around giving people too many details of a potential crime, so I'd assume they just asked general questions. Also, let's remember Adnan is high (this may not matter to you, but it matters), from all accounts extremely high, I doubt the first thing he thinks about is that she's in California, I also doubt his mind naturally jumps to something horrible happening to her either. Thinking oh shit she's going to be in trouble when she gets home seems like a pretty typical reaction to me. His reaction to Aisha seems normal given the circumstance as well, he doesn't think Hae is in danger, he's not mad at Aisha for calling him but for telling the police to call him when he's high and has weed in his car, let's remember he's a teenager, maybe he is being selfish but so are most people his age. The not paging thing has been discussed a million times on this sub, I think whether or not you find it suspicious that he didn't call her is completely subjective, there have been many people on here who say they would absolutely have paged her and many who said they might have done the same thing as Adnan. I actually don't know what I would do, I want to say I would have, but when I was in high school everyone I knew had a cell phone, Hae only had a pager, so I don't know how I would react when my only option of contact is a pager. You keep mentioning how he's one of her closest friends, so I guess you don't find it suspicious that he called Hae three times the night before, you know because they're so close. I think we all look at this case with our own confirmation biases, and pick and choose which details help our arguments. Edit - I agree with what that detective told SK, Adnan's reactions to things aren't really going to tell us anything, we should throw it out and just focus on the evidence, for example apparently Adnan cried and was in denial when he was told about Hae's death, I doubt this convinces you of his innocence and it shouldn't.	20141129T232106
anonymous	2	0	"He didn't dismiss it and he didn't disregard it. He thought: she is going to be in trouble with her mom. That is the extent of his acknowledgement because he is the ex-boyfriend not the current boyfriend. She could have been blowing off her obligations to hook up with her new bf. Just because she is ""known"" to be responsible doesn't mean she can't do what she wants on occasion. She was having sex with Adnan and smoking weed which was against her family's wishes as well. It's not an ex-boyfriends responsibility to stop everything he is doing and frantically track down his ex-gf whenever her mom is looking for her."	20141130T004255
asha24	4	0	Or the reaction of a self absorbed ex boyfriend who while keeping apprised of the situation (why would Hae respond to him and not any of her best friends?), does not believe something horrible has happened to her (believes she has chosen to leave), is in his senior year of high school, and interested in other girls. To be honest, I think this is pretty odd as well, however I don't think this is the type of thing that can necessarily indicate guilt/innocence.	20141129T235109
anonymous	1	0	Adnan and Hae were broken up and no longer together therefore I don't hold it against him that he wasn't all up in arms looking for Hae. Secondly you cannot make an inference about his innocence or guilt by looking at his reaction to Hae's disappearance. If my 17 yr old sister went missing my dad, my mom and I would have three very different reactions. My mom would assume the worst because she's a worry wart. My dad would be furious for worrying her mom and i on the other hand would think that she's just being a teenager. My sis ter is a straight A student who is going to Colombia next year.	20141201T185717

MusicCompany	1	0	> First of all we don't know the exact details that were given to Adnan, was he told specifically that Hae didn't pick up her cousin? True. We don't know the details. But he had three people call him, and likely one of them revealed the detail about her cousin. And if they didn't, isn't the most logical question to ask when you're told someone is missing is where they were seen last? Or did Adnan not ask any questions and get off the phone as quickly as possible? This latter seems to be the case. He was annoyed with Aisha. All three phone calls are very short. The call from the police officer was the longest, likely because the officer asked the most questions. I don't think we can assume anything about how being high would affect his responses. Everyone seems to assume (with a wink and a smile) that any weirdness on his part stems from the fact that he's high and is thus paranoid. Like, isn't that funny? He's high. And we're so cool that we don't hold that against him. It's like a pro-drugs ad. Hey, kids, if you ever get accused of a crime, make sure you're high when the police call. That way everyone will laugh off anything you say that doesn't make sense or is inappropriate to the situation.	20141201T165644

MusicCompany	1	0	> Adnan and Hae were broken up and no longer together therefore I don't hold it against him that he wasn't all up in arms looking for Hae. I could see your point if it seemed like Adnan really had moved on from Hae. But he wasn't acting like someone who had moved on. Sure, he was trying to date other girls. But those phone calls around midnight on January 12 with a thin excuse (giving her his phone number)? Talking to her multiple times in classes that day? Asking her for a ride under a pretense (even if you assume that pretense wasn't to kill her)? That's not a guy who has moved on. Whenever I've gone through a break-up, if that person calls me even once post-break-up, then I know they aren't over me. Never mind the stated reason for the call. I've known people who've abandoned valuable possessions rather than call an ex to get the possession back. And when I find myself making excuses to call and/or see someone? That's when I know I'm not over them.	20141201T195304
anonymous	1	0	Right. His reaction doesn't matter. He didn't do anything more or less than he should have. There was no reason for anyone who knew Hae to think that anything sinister had happened. She was considered responsible by her parents but her parents didn't know she was having sex and smoking weed. Anyone who knew the real Hae could have very easily reasoned that she was just blowing off her responsibility for one day and that the worst case scenario was that she'd be in trouble when she got home.	20141201T183227
asha24	1	0	Well I think him being upset when the body was found is as significant as him not paging her, that is not significant at all. It's not an indication of guilt or innocence either way.	20141130T020211

If a pathological liar like Jay can put someone behind bars for life that's pretty messed up So let's stop pretending like we know what is or was going through their minds. Let's just take a look at the facts. A witness who cannot keep his story straight and who outright lies. An example of how I don't believe a damn thing of what he says is when he says that Adnan was speaking ARabic to someone. Adnan doesn't know Arabic and not everyone muslim speaks Arabic. Adnan would have been speaking Pakistani if he knew how to. Just little things like that that make me go what the hell? Why would you lie about something like that? I think he's lying about everything.	20141202T003047
MusicCompany	1	0	Adnan did know the real Hae. And he thought that she would absolutely not deviate from going to pick up her cousin. Edit: OR, when asked in a different context... he thought she was being irresponsible. Hence the contradiction.	20141201T184632
MusicCompany	1	0	I'm not going to convince you. That's fine. But Jay did know things. He knew where Hae's car was, first and foremost. He told Jenn and Chris that Adnan killed Hae long before the police questioned him. Jay isn't lying about everything. He lies about a few key things at different times and for different reasons. That doesn't mean you get to toss out everything he says.	20141202T130900
anonymous	1	0	"Nope. He did not think she would NEVER do that. He thought: she is going to be in big trouble. There is no evidence to the contrary. He has stated that ""anyone who knows Hae knows she always picks up her cousin after school"" and also ""oh wow she is gonna be in big trouble with her mom"". Those two statements support each other. Not contradict. The reason she will be in trouble is because she needs to pick up her cousin. That doesn't preclude the possibility of her choosing for once to not be the most responsible person in the world. She was a teenager and it's not crazy to think that sometime teenagers do what they want. She had openly spoken of running off to California. She had a new boyfriend. All of these things were considered when she first went missing by ALL of here friends. Whether you care to admit it, you are biased by the fact that you already know something bad happened. Most people do not immediately jump to the conclusion that something sinister has happened just because someone misses one appointment and they certainly don't feel it is their responsibility to resolve the situation as soon as they are made aware of it."	20141201T191022
anonymous	1	0	"The point that I am trying to make is that we cannot believe Jay without a reasonable doubt since he lies so much. If he is lying about little things that don't even matter why believe his story at all? He could have stumbled upon Hae's car by accident. Maybe he was driving around trying to find a place to smoke weed and he finds it. There are so many ""what ifs"" and ""could haves"" that it doesn't even matter in this case anymore. Jay cannot be trusted in my opinion. A part of me really wants Adnan to be guilty because he's just spent the last 15 years in prison. However I do really feel like the justice system has failed miserably in this case and I feel like there is about a 75% change that the wrong person is in jail and that's heartbreaking. Our justice system is built to prevent this. Therefore we have juries and things like reasonable doubt."	20141202T145507
MusicCompany	1	0	The statement that her mom is going to be upset with her is a statement minimizing her disappearance. He's not committing himself to what he thinks she's up to, but he's implying it's something trivial, that she's blowing off her obligations to have fun (hence him not being worried about it). That's a contradiction from saying she takes her responsibility to her cousin seriously because knowing that should have ratcheted up his concern. It ratcheted up Aisha's concern, the school's concern, and Hae's family's concern, and it was convincing enough that the police immediately became involved. As for my personal response, I always assume the worst case scenario. If I don't get a phone call when I'm expecting it, I assume disaster. Sure, people differ on this, but not everyone assumes that everything is fine. But so what? I realize that people differ wildly in their assumptions. We still come back to this point: should Adnan, in this specific instance, have reasonably concluded that there was nothing to worry about?	20141201T200726
MusicCompany	1	0	I appreciate that someone can look at this case and see it completely differently. I think we bring ourselves to this story. I guess my biggest worry, bigger than concerns about the justice system, is that a man who murdered a woman gets believed and gets out. I know the justice system is flawed; I've been on board with documentaries like Murder on a Sunday Morning and the West Memphis 3 documentaries. But when I hear this story, I actually perceive it as a justice system that worked and found the truth (not the whole truth, but close). For me, what Jay says can't be dismissed because what he says can be cross-checked in multiple ways. You can't believe every word of it, of course, but there's an element of truth there. A spine, as others have put it.	20141202T151118
anonymous	1	0	I guess we just have to agree to disagree. Our justice system works that way and yea, a few bad people get released (OJ Simpson) but there are also those that are innocent who are suppose to be protected by our justice system. I have removed my emotions from this and I look at it objectively but it doesn't seem right to me. Logically the case against Adnan just doesn't make sense to me and I am not looking at this from a legal perspective (I have no background) but I am trying to imagine myself a juror and how I would vote if I were on the jury.	20141203T003447

PowerOfYes	29	0	I'm not. For a start, they didn't come forward - they knew the police were looking at Jenn and Jay probably realised she's not a gifted liar and told her to 'come clean' with the story he's given her. The best part of her interview is when she tells the police how shocked she is when Jay tells her about the news reports of Hae gone missing - even though, she's just finished telling the police she knew about Hae's death on day 1. It just seems like she's been caught out telling the truth at that moment. Her evidence is just so weird. I suspect that the police officers didn't really believe her.	20141129T213117
8shadesofgray	6	0	"This story reads patently false to me. The biggest takeaway I got from this, which I find *deeply* troubling is that Jenn, a ""person of interest"", was so easily able to get a hold of non-public information about the case before she was interviewed by police."	20141130T071505

Why sit back and wait for the cops to learn about your involvement from someone else who might tell them any number of things that implicate you in the murder when you can establish the ""story"" first, minimizing your own participation and winning points for confessing? He isn't the sharpest knife the drawer, but he and his family were involved in crime, so my guess is that he had some understanding of these things. And it clearly worked for him."	20141129T234956
whitenoise2323	5	0	"So the cops call Jenn in and she says nothing. They are left wondering ""why did our suspect call her 6 times the day Hae went missing and she wont talk?"" ... then Jenn becomes a suspect. At that point if she continued not to talk they would go to Adnan and say ""why did you call Jenn six times that day?"" and Adnan would say ""I didn't, Jay had my phone"" so they go pick up Jay and say ""You had Adnan's phone and car that day, we know you hung out with him in the morning, in the evening. What do you know about this?"" If Jay refuses to talk then he becomes the suspect. At that point it becomes a mind-reading guessing game... did they find the car? Did they find physical evidence on Hae's body? What do they know? These cops aren't letting go of Jenn, Jay, or Adnan until they get to the bottom of it. Probably they think all three of them conspired together. Then they do actual detective work (something they didn't need to do with Jay's testimony) and test all the fibers and the bottle and the rope and search Jay's house and search Jenn's house and... and... and... they would probably find something linking someone to the crime."	20141130T024654

It's very close to the intersection where Jay claims the trunk pop happened during the 1st police interview. I guess he was there earlier in the day? Why say he was at Jenn's if he was there?

anonymous	11	0	The failure to follow up with Asia makes no sense. There was no obligation to use whatever she had to say, so it's hard to think of a reason not to find out what it was and what kind of witness she might have made. My guess is that the lawyer had convinced herself that Jay would be such an easy witness to destroy and discredit that she thought she wouldn't need to tag all the other bases.	20141129T220338
Cabin11	17	0	Theory two: If Gutierrez thought that Hae was killed at or near the library, the Asia letters would work against Adnan.	20141129T211943
stravoskoiladitis	7	0	"Theory one: Gutierrez did not realize Asia was a potential alibi witness. After all, if you read Asia's letters, she herself doesn't seem to think she is an alibi witness, since she wants Adnan to look her in the eyes and tell her he didn't do it. Asia's potential alibi is significant only if you believe the prosecution's theory, that Adnan had killed Hae by 2:36 and was already calling Jay to come pick him up at BestBuy. But that theory was only articulated in the prosecution's closing statement, unless I'm mistaken. Gutierrez could not reasonably have guessed it was coming. Jay himself places the ""come pick me up"" call much later, and so does Jenn, if I'm not misreading her statements. Faced with all that evidence, Gutierrez might well have thought that Asia's testimony would be irrelevant: even if she confirmed that Adnan made an appearance at the library immediately after school, he might have cleared out fast enough to catch up with Hae and kill her. In fact, the evidence introduced at the beginning of Episode 9, from the girl who said she remembers Hae lingering on after school and talking/arguing with her whether she would go to the wrestling match, makes such a scenario more likely. It tends to show that Hae herself did not leave school immediately after classes ended."	20141129T222343

whitenoise2323	5	0	I'll just throw Rabia's theory out there since nobody else has. Gutierrez wanted to lose the case so she could make money on the appeal. What does she have to gain from interviewing Asia if she isn't interested in winning?	20141130T010636
gummy_einkanter	3	0	Oh, there are tags now. Should I tag this speculation?	20141129T210704
blbunny	3	0	"TOTAL SPECULATION Here's a theory: Adnan, being a teenager who has no real experience with the criminal justice system, blurts out to his lawyer that he was involved/that he did it, not realizing he'll have more options in terms of trial strategy if he doesn't tell her that. Ethical constraints prohibit a lawyer from offering testimony or facts that she knows to be false. This explains a great deal: Gutierrez doesn't follow up on alibi witnesses because she knows she can't present their testimony since she knows Adnan was there. Gutierrez doesn't let Adnan take the stand because to do so is to suborn perjury. Gutierrez can't even present an alternative theory of the case, but is limited to poking holes in the prosecution's evidence. This is why she hits Jay's testimony so hard -- it's all she can legitimately offer. And maybe she felt the inconsistencies were strong enough that she could win at trial, and therefore didn't seek a plea deal. This might also relate to two things I've been wondering about: (1) exactly what did the first trial judge mean when he called Gutierrez ""dishonest"" leading to the first mistrial? and (2) there was a motion to disqualify defense counsel -- what was that all about?"	20141130T143117
KPCinNYC	7	0	There are multiple reasons that she wouldnt want Asia testifying. Number one being that her story would be destroyed on cross examination which would make her look like an alibi patsy and thats not good.	20141129T212010
gummy_einkanter	2	0	"My hunch was along the lines of blbunny's, though there are far more great alternatives there that I hadn't spent enough time considering. Even if Gutierrez thought the crime was at the library, I guess she could have conceivably come to that without a confession, and independent of whether or not she thought Adnan actually did it. Maybe CG had some other reason for not putting him on the stand (he was probably a defensive, overconfident teen - she may have just worried about the prosecution leading him into saying something stupid). It's even possible the state thought that the crime took place at the library too, but was worried about placing it too near the school. Closer to school might lose them the element of premeditation and lead to a reduced sentence. SK has commented on the gap between real world truth and courtroom truth before, especially with her ""All facts are friendly"" discussion. That might be one of the biggest themes of the show, how truth gets mangled a bit on its way into a courtroom. In line with that, the most provocative realization I've had about the case so far is: **It's at least possible that both the state and the defense believed the crime took place at a certain location, but neither side wanted that mentioned at trial.**"	20141130T150554

shapshapboetie	1	0	We actually need more insight on Gutierrez regarding Jay. She obviously impugned his credibility during cross-examination. But did she propose an alternative theory of the case in which Jay, his brother/ his uncle, or father was the do-er? They were connected to the West Baltimore drug culture, and they all knew or know Jenn. This is public information. I believe Jay noted his family history in a police statement. Why did Gutierrez not try to shift attention to the criminal history in Jay's family? Did she investigate their wearabouts? At the very least, who had possession of the shovels, and at what time? If any of the above were involved, it would give a clear motive for Jay to lie to the police, if not to be involved as an accessory after the fact. Not pursuing that line of inquiry equals the miscue the Asia alibi at the library. The Asia miscue is about alibi. The Jay/family member as prime suspect is a miscue about reasonable doubt in itself.	20141129T232017
anonymous	1	0	"I thought SK said at the end of episode 9 something like why Christina couldn't get to reasonable doubt.""? I think she will touch on CG, talk about her strategy, maybe her illness a bit. However, then I think she will pivot and talk about things like: why she couldn't put Adnan on the stand, talk about others who corroborate Jays testimony, and reason why there was no follow up with Asia and Will."	20141130T014818
temp4adhd	1	0	My theory is that CG, in trying to put together a solid alibi for Adnan, found incriminating evidence such as emails he wrote while at the library, or videotaped footage placing Adnan at the scene of the crime, or library pay phone record calling Jenn's house. Bringing Asia into the equation only raises the risk of the prosecutors also finding the same evidence her PIs did.	20141129T225913
anonymous	2	0	Right. Did Gutierrez and Adnan know the contents of Jay's testimony? Perhaps they were under the impression that maybe the police thought Hae could have been killed at the library, making Asia's letters useless. And it didn't come up later because of that thing where she said she was coerced? (fuzzy on the details of that)	20141129T232654

darncats4	2	0	I think it will be aboutvwhy the jury didn't buy gutierrez's strategy to see reasonable doubt. i have a feeling more incriminating facts are headed iur way. it is an even numbered ep after all. and i can't get past the fact that they convicted after 2 hours including lunch. i think there's a lot of testimony we haven't heard about (like the teaser quote about the threat).	20141130T011912
whitenoise2323	9	0	Jay didn't testify to that. Jay's friend Chris told SK the library location story in 2014. Jay told police in interviews that Adnan killed Hae off Edmonson Ave, at Best Buy, and at Patapsco. He testified in both trials that Adnan killed her at Best Buy. No library story for Gutierrez to know about.	20141130T010439
gummy_einkanter	2	0	You don't really have time during the trial, but that's why the prosecution is required to be an open book pretrial in terms of the witnesses they're planning to call and their theory of the case. Defense has to ask the right questions though. So I think this is a great open question, how much about the state's timeline did Gutierrez know before the trial?	20141130T144751

I don't believe they were ever good friends (my opinion) but rather just smoking buddies. Regardless of how close they were, it does sound as though they were still around each other from time to time. If Nisha correctly remembers a call occurring where she talked to Adnan and Jay while Jay was working at the video store, this would have been between the two times you mentioned (I don't mean this as a statement about what she believes happened during the call the day of the murder; I just mean that if ANY call occurred while at the video store, it had to be after Hae's murder because of when Jay was hired).	20141129T214044

They just wanted enough to make a conviction possible, and here he was with the ""spine"" all dished up on a platter. Jealous boyfriend. (motive) Details of burial. (method) Location of victim's car. (means) They would have been crazy to arrest him once they realized he'd be happy to testify under oath to just about any patched up version. The true mystery here is about how there was nobody with a credible motive to kill Hae Lee, and yet somebody did."	20141130T011737
anonymous	5	0	While reddit's search function is pretty awful, it actually works pretty well in this sub since people are mostly posting self posts. If you [do a search](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/search?q=stephanie&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all), you'll see Stephanie has been discussed several times. I didn't read anything but the first line and the TL;DR, but she had a solid alibi for the day, she was at basketball practice all day.	20141129T213822

Hopper80	0	0	I've wondered about this - the prom thing, its happening on Stephanie's birthday, that she didn't drop him as soon as she found out what he admitted to doing (you know, on her birthday). Then the possibilities in terms of love triangles/quadrangles/pentagons. But: there is so little data, and too many stories. For right or wrong, the detectives focused on Adnan, and any other possibilities went by the wayside, including data that may have been sought and collected in considering those possibilities. And anyone who now looks at the case is left with the freedom to consider pretty much what their imagination will let them, with nothing to counter it except a few witness statements, the call log and tower ping of one phone over 24 hours, and whatever limits are set by their idea of 'plausible'.	20141129T224207

Powatoole	-4	0	Chris's words paraphrased, Jay would do ANYTHING for Stephanie	20141129T215346
Powatoole	-5	0	What I think is that when girls get competitive they can get mean. I had 3 sisters that I watched do some of the most unexplainable catty actions to their nemesis. I believe that she could have had a frenemy relationship with Hae that got out of hand. Maybe on her birthday she wanted something to make her feel extra superior. If she was the one who created the scenario, then she would have been partially responsible. So I do not believe that she stood by her boyfriend that killed her friend but rather she protected her co conspirator.	20141129T221941
MissMignon	1	0	"This theory follows Stephanie's complete silence on Hae's disappearance and murder. Steph doesn't talk about this with anyone then or now. Her ""trick"" went too far. And why Stephanie then went to Jay's hearing with him. Her guilt kept her having to be with him."	20141202T032311
KPCinNYC	13	0	Other students at the school said he did.	20141129T222039
readybrek	1	0	The cop's statement is corroborated by I think two other students. Although they are not as straight forward as three people said Adnan asked for a lift, Adnan was later seen leaving the school with Hae. Adnan's own explanation is confused. He doesn't think he would have asked for a lift that day as he knew Hae had to pick up her cousin but on the other hand he also says he didn't want to admit to asking for a lift in front of his Dad.	20141130T110850
anonymous	4	0	The reasoning is that she must have been abducted that day because she missed the preschool pick up, and that she also must have died that day because there are no signs that she was held, like rope marks on her wrists.	20141129T224307
godlessgam3r	5	0	They came to that conclusion based on a number of things, from what I have gathered. You are right the definitely knew when she went missing so they started there. Then the anonymous call triggered them pulling the call records, which led them to Jenn. And Jenn and Jay would tell the cops it happened on the 13th, the same day the records show numerous calls from Adnans cell to Jenn. This seems to be the primary reasoning, the call records and Jay and Jenns testimony. The weather the following days tells them it was likely she was buried before the ice storm that hits the morning of the 14th, as opposed to her just sitting in a trunk for several days or being kidnapped (no evidence of that), so that probably played a factor as well.	20141129T224341
anonymous	4	0	In Jenn's statement doesn't she say Hae died at 8:00? Maybe I misread, but I didn't think she was talking about the burial at that time. It stood out as one of the many strange things. Edit: On pg. 3 of Jenn's statement (the first typed page) her very first sentence says Adnan killed Hae at 8:00 according to Jay.	20141130T025719
Glitteranji	2	0	"In this appeal document, on page 5, last paragraph, the medical examinor testified that he *was unable to testify as to when she had been killed."" https://pdf.yt/d/PUUcby-AZWfEhcuW So although I see lots of people on here asserting that's when it happened, due to lack of, say, ligature marks on her wrists indicating she'd been held for a time, it looks as if there is no definitive time of death."	20141203T020702
Zelbinian	2	0	Yeah, and I should say that I definitely think the 13th makes the most sense, almost too much sense to bother imagining anything else.

Many times I have to go to court and cannot bring my phone in, I put my car in the glove box because it's a safer place to stash a phone without people seeing it and wanting to break in. It's possible that he saw the red gloves in there and uses those gloves in the murder or adnan uses them and he remembers them.	20141130T013037
lafolieisgood	1	0	I graduated from high school in 1996, so only a couple of years earlier. It was a semi rural, low crime, small town in the bible belt and even there cars were routinely broken into in the school parking lot to steal CDs. Leaving something even remotely valuable out in plain sight was uncommon	20141130T180159
CompleteTool	1	0	I get that someone wouldn't leave it in plain sight if they were leaving it in their car but supposedly, Adnan wanted Jay to keep the phone on him so that he would be available if/when Adnan needed a pick up. To me, it seems more probable that Adnan was dropped off at school with the expressed expectation that Jay pick him up at a specific time -- say after track practice. Adnan had just got the phone but we know from Will's comments that it was normal for Jay to pick Adnan up from track practice...so how did they arrange this prior to Adnan having a cell phone? When Adnan gets the phone back, he seems to immediately check his voicemail...another sign that he was not expecting Jay to answer his phone while Adnan was not with the phone.	20141130T185636

But the thing I don't get is why isn't everyone demanding Serial to continue with this story for more than 12 episodes. Why should we just accept that this episode will end, like a single TAL show ends??? I want to hear so much more. And now, not after next year or something. TAL is amazing not boring!

SheriffAmosTupper	8	0	Yep. Doesn't have to be a crime mystery, but I need some element of mystery. Historical mystery, archaeological mystery, intergenerational old-person mystery (as you describe above). I'm not picky. If it's a 12-part series on something like the life of an apple farmer or the challenges of teachers in an underfunded educational system or the crisis of political gridlock in Washington, I will not be tuning in (no matter how important those issues are). That's just not something to which I would enjoy listening--certainly not 12 episodes' worth. No offense to apple farmers or teachers. Edit: Let me add that I actually think it's going to be the latter, and not a mystery, unfortunately. I also think it will be quite some time before they pull something together.	20141130T033438

reddit1101	4	0	Jay very likely told his girlfriend what happened. The truth. That Jay helped Adnan kill Hae and he was involved. He tells her the truth, which is Adnan has dirt on him and he didn't want to go to jail. He was in a bit of a shock, made a mistake in helping him. He was involved and had to now help him so they both don't go to prison. He also threatened to him he was going to hurt/kill Stephanie too. He couldn't think straight, didn't want to go to the police, and just wanted to protect girlfriend who he loves. Stephanie is probably in utter shock hearing all this. She feels bad for Jay and him feeling like he had to help him to protect her/their relationship. She's in grief and wants Adnan who in fact strangled Hae to be convicted and go to prison.	20141130T021217

I assume there's people he knows now that don't know about his past. - Stephanie: Too little is known about her to hazard much of a guess.

mostpeoplearedjs	2	0	I think some people assume Jay would tell his girlfriend 'the whole truth' and that accessing that would answer the fundamental question of whether Jay lied about Adnan's guilt. The problem with that is: 1. There's no guarantee Jay would tell her 'the whole truth' and 2. Even if Stephanie went on record supporting Jay, some people would question if she was being truthful. She implicitly did so by standing by him, but people here still wonder, so her saying it probably wouldn't change much.	20141130T104045
whitenoise2323	4	0	A few people have speculated about how Jay would have gotten the opportunity to murder Hae that afternoon, there is no proof though. One theory is that Hae planned to confront Jay about his infidelity the next time she saw him and sought him out, possibly calling Adnan's phone at 2:36. This is corroborated (Hae wanting to confront him, not the phone call) by a note that Rabia posted on her blog. Another theory is that Hae wanted to meet up with Jay to buy pot for herself or Don. Another theory is that Hae saw Adnan's car and thinking it was him approached Jay and saw something that he needed to cover up or confronted him at that time.	20141130T001022
appleFLAVOREDbananas	3	0	The way I look at this is that there could be a million reasons that Jay came into contact with Hae that afternoon. It could have been at any random place then an argument and fight. It could have been her buying drugs. It could have been that Jay and Hae had some romantic involvement that nobody knew about. I mean everything sounds crazy but think about in your life and every unlikely person you come in contact with. An explanation helps but it is not necessary to believe Jay did it.	20141130T034208

CompleteTool	1	0	If Adnan had asked her for a ride earlier in the day and she couldn't find him after school (he had to run to the counselor's office to pick up a letter of recommendation?) would she have maybe called his phone trying to locate him and see if he still needed a ride? This would mean one of the incoming calls could have been Hae calling Adnan's cell. This would explain how Jay came in contact with Hae and also how Jay knew that Adnan had asked her for a ride that day (she told Jay).	20141201T012801
TrillianSwan	1	0	I have another crazy theory-- that she had some kind of car trouble again (the car would have to be still-drivable, so maybe a weird noise?) and she pulls over and calls Adnan like she did the last time it acted up.

joshuarion	1	0	Body decomposition was pretty well understood back in 1999. The original 'body farm' had been operating for 18 years by that point and tested decomp rates in a slew of conditions. You can't just keep a person alive and held hostage without them struggling to get out of their bonds. The ropes/tape/whatever leaves burns/abrasions/residue that the cops look for. It's a pretty reasonable assumption that the decomposition of her body, lack of ligature marks/adhesive residue on her wrists/legs/ankles and cause of death (manual strangulation) all tell the narrative that she was strangled the day she went missing...	20141130T002234
anonymous	10	0	There can't be. As the Slate podcast says, at the VERY LEAST, Jay is involved. So there are only two real questions: 1) was Adnan involved? 2) to what extent was Jay involved?	20141130T013704

Dr__Nick	4	0	There are too many moving parts for an alternative theory.

gaussprime	1	0	Impossible? No. Plausible? Also no. The lack of a motive is a big deal by itself. So is opportunity. So is the Nisha call, suggesting Adnan was with Jay. So is the lack of physical evidence of Jay inside Hae's car. And finally, Adnan's own story places his cell phone in his possession at the time of the Leakin Park tower pings. For Jay to have done it alone, we need Jay to have Adnan's phone much later than Adnan says he got it back. Presently, the idea that Jay did it alone doesn't pass muster with me.	20141201T001520

goliath_franco	1	0	If you re-listen to the first podcast where he and Sarah go through his day, it's not true at all that he can't remember anything from the day. He just has a blank spot from about 1 or 2pm until about 5pm. He recalls giving Jay his car in the morning. (He actually says that he drives to Jay's house to *ask Jay if Jay bought a gift for Stephanie*, which sounds very odd to me.) Then, he's not sure what he did after school or whether he was at track, and he is sure that he got a call from the cops in the evening (and where he was when he got the call and so forth). So he just can't recall the specific period of time when Hae was likely being murdered. Regarding his recollection of the day, he even says ([episode one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tf9zC1atDaClrBt2waYpMQP8UHB034FdxzvhajOFw2A/edit?pli=1)): >> I do kind of understand that it comes across as-- I don't know if it does or doesn't.

It's just that I don't really know what to say beyond the fact that a lot of the day that I do remember, it's bits and pieces that comes from what other people have said that they remember ... Yeah.

The__Winchester	2	0	Fair enough but I just think that after having listened to episode 9, Adnan is just too accepting of his situation. He has lost all of his young adulthood in prison and yet not once has he tried to blame Jay. He's not bitter about him in any way. So if he's not an accessory to it he must have done it. The other thing that we just don't think adds up is that he contacts Hae 3 times the night before the murder but then never again once she is 'missing'. When quizzed about it by SK he was hesitant / annoyed and doesn't have a plausible explanation	20141130T082233
ReaderThinker	1	0	I agree. Someones gonna kill your HS girlfriend and you are not going to report it? Jay was just an acquaintance, Hae was his ex-love and current friend. I think if this had been the case, Adnan would have turned Jay in.	20141130T190520
Planned_Apathy	1	0	But Adnan could backtrack at any time. Jay backtracked after his initial claims. And so did Jen. Most/many potentially or actually implicated witnesses do backtrack. And, as a lawyer, you can be certain that I would get the truth from Adnan and pursue it. Adnan had absolutely zero reason to conceal his actions from his lawyer, especially since she advised him to remain silent and not testify.	20141130T083719
Planned_Apathy	2	0	Jay was implicated in at least the planning (having advance knowledge at a minimum) and in concealing the crime (participating in or at least knowing about the body disposition). Plus, he was a drug dealer. And, in any case, he did quickly tell the police everything (assuming we can believe him) after his initial interrogation. So, my answer is that he had some issues that prevented him from affirmatively initiating plaice contact, but he still told the police everything very quickly. Under the theory described above, there are zero corresponding issues that would've prevented Adnan from telling the police everything immediately or -- at a minimum -- telling police everything once he was interrogated and especially after he was implicated.	20141130T083347

Virginonimpossible	3	0	The Thin Blue Line is kind of similar although the victim is a police officer and not an ex gf. 'B' is arrested and blames the murder on 'A', 'A' is arrested and tells a similar story to 'B' but insists he has no memory of the part where the murder happens so 'A' is given a life sentence. I guess it is only similar in that Randell Adams was convicted based on information from David Harris (who was the actual murderer) so it will be similar if it turns out Jay is the murderer. Randell Adams maintained his innocence and David Harris continued committing less serious crimes until he finally murdered another person.

anonymous	4	0	Hae is dead. Which is awful, and very sad, and the reason we're all here and such. But nothing that's said or done here can hurt her now. Her family, yes. Her, no. Stephanie is very much alive, and out there somewhere, doing her best - as far as we know - to steer clear of this entire spectacle. She was a borderline peripheral figure in a terrible tragedy, at a pretty formative time in her life - and it's obvious that she'd prefer not to revisit it. And now 20,000 people of varying degrees of technological savvy, with a taste for armchair investigating, are curious about her. That in so many, many ways, is a recipe for disaster. And that's why I think so many people are so protective of her privacy in general - because all it takes is one particularly motivated person to make us all look like crazy assholes with nothing better to do than harass people.	20141130T162401

dmbroad	3	0	"The beauty of the Nisha call, per Susan Simpson's ""Cell Records Comparison"" blog post, is that it pings near Woodlawn High-School area, including Best Buy. Which shows that the killer could not have taken Adnan to Track Practice after disposing of Hae's car at the I70 Park-and-Go. Will said Track Practice started at 4:00. But Inez who runs the concession stand located near the gym said it started around 3:30. The time difference allows for Track Team members to arrive at the gym to change clothes and warm up as runners do. Cell data shows Jay would have had to drive Hae's car -- with her body in the trunk -- *himself* to the I70 Park-and-Go. The next two calls after Nisha, 3:48 and 3:59, ping at cell tower nearest to there. Then Jay is off to Patrick's house at 4:12 (who lives in Forest Park and cell tower pings closest to there). Patrick must give Jay a ride back to his house to retrieve a shovel at 4:27 (ping nears Jay's house). And Adnan's call at 4:58 to be picked up at Track also pings at Jay's house (police also conclude this call is from Adnan for same reason). The 4:12 call to Jenn home may be asking her to meet him at his house so she can give him a ride back to Adnan's car. (Not that she knows what is going on at this time. In fact, Jay only told Jenn that was Adnan's car the night before her interview with police *after Hae's body had been found,* per her police statement. Though that must have been a slip on her part.) Susan Simpson's ""Comparison of Adnan's Cell Phone Records to The Witness Statements"" also shows how Jay had to have buried the body at Leakin Park *himself,* and relocated Hae's car to the second spot on Edmondson Avenue *himself.* The Nisha call comes in a string of calls to Jay's friends and associates, which makes it anomalous. A scientist in an experiment might throw it out for not conforming to the overall pattern. Speaking of patterns, you notice in Susan's ""Comparison"" that when Adnan is with his phone, *Jay does not use it to call his friends at all.* Calls 5:14 after track practice through 6:59 are Adnan's. The 6:59 call to Yaser pings at Adnan's house, so is when Jay drops Adnan at home to get the meal to take to his Father at the Mosque. Then at 7:00, Jay is back again in communication with Jenn for five more incoming and outgoing calls. Which makes sense because he once again has sole use of Adnan's cellphone and car. Jenn admits to police that the two incoming 7:09 and 7:16 call while at Leakin Park are from her responding to Jay's 7:00 page. He then calls Jenn twice to pick him up en route from Edmondson Road, where he has driven Hae's car to its second and final location. Actually at 8:05, the cell tower pings farther Westward of Edmondson Ave., so Jay appears to be walking on foot back toward Jenn's house direction. She tells police she picks him up at a Mall around 8:00. This is what she is talking about, although what mall is unknown as she lies as much as Jay does in her police statement. Adnan does not make any calls from 6:59 to 9:01, during these two critical events.

Dysbrainiac	2	0	Why complicate things? Hae needs to be at her cousin at 3:15. There is no sign of kidnapping, therefore she was most likely killed before 3:15 but after 2 or even 2:30. After 3:15 a lot of people are called. If the person calling brutally murdered someone less than an hour ago he is most likely in quite a state. Why is a miss dial to the first speed dial number so strange amoung these calls? Especially if the person calling has little previous experience with mobile phones, or brutal murders for that matters?	20141130T183712
wayback2	1	0	The Nisha call is at 3:32pm not 3:21. Probaly a bit to late for being the moment she was killed unless she was being held up against her will for quite some time before getting strangled.	20141130T035637
anonymous	1	0	Another theory: Adnan reunites with his phone after Jay kills Hae and calls her right before practice. This explains the incoming at 3:15pm (from Adnan at school) and the subsequent call to Jenn's house to see what Jay should do.

speculator11	1	0	that's an interesting thought....a struggle might not sound like much either, but I doubt someone would stay on the line for over 2 minutes (that's a really long time!) so far as I remember from the podcast Nisha doesn't remember hearing from Adnan that day so some variety of butt dial is likely, and a struggle at 3:21 would fit a lot of timelines and could certainly cause a butt dial!	20141130T030943

anonymous	15	0	"I really don't understand this…at all… SK and her producer drove to the Best Buy…twice, because they fucked up the first time.

What's thoroughly scoured? Talking to the landlord and pulling up the original blueprints to see if the Best Buy had phones. They tracked down Verizon & the known pay phone companies at the time to see if there was a pay phone there. Nothing in their research indicated there was a pay phone there. So, some redditor goes to Best Buy and snaps a photo of junction boxes where pay phones may have been. And we are lead to believe that a journalist and a producer who were researching whether or not pay phones were there would not have been smart enough to do this. Sorry, I simply don't buy it. There were no pay phones at the Best Buy."	20141130T122717

abeliangrape	3	0	I don't think it needs to be mentioned at all because it has to be bullshit. This guy has been working there since 2003. If he remembers a payphone, it must have been there even before he started working in 2003 because nobody was installing new pay phones after that point. But SK has pictures from 2001 that don't show any payphones. He has to be misremembering because the only other explanation is that SK doesn't have pictures of best buy and is deliberately lying to us. If the first option is true, then there's no need to mention anything. If the second is, then we have a problem that can't be patched with a simple mention like this because nothing SK says can ever hold any weight any more. p.s. Not to mention that there are no records of the phones in the blueprints, or in Verizon's or any other phone company's database. And there are tons of other reasons to have electrical junctions like that. Almost everything uses electricity.	20141130T160947
pj12341234	4	0	A hyper alert shoplifter would be looking out for staff, other customers and cameras, no payphones, so it's entirely possible she didn't notice them. I've been in 2 large supermarkets today, and didn't notice any phones, despite the fact that all large supermarkets have them( in the UK at least), so customers can call for a taxi to get their shopping home.	20141130T034320
anonymous	15	0	First of all, Serial owes this subreddit absolutely nothing. It's the same thing Serial owes the AV Club, Slate, and any other number of discussion sites to the show. Secondly, all the photograph shows is that there were junction boxes. There is nothing to attest to if these were used for anything. It is also just as likely that these cookie-cutter stores are all built the same way, and that it's easier to plan for installing pay phones than to want them later and try to put them in. So, just because there are junction boxes there doesn't mean that there were ever pay phones there. Also, in episode 5, SK recounts how they contacted Verizon, known payphone providers at the time, the landlord, they called up blueprints, rummaged through service agreements, talked to the public utilities department…and none of their research produced any evidence that a pay phone was there. If the SK and her team spent any considerable time at the store, which I imagine they did since they talked to managers and landlords and were looking up service agreements, I'm sure they know where the restroom are at the store. I'm also sure they entered and exited the store through the foyer. I'm sure they noticed the junction boxes, but since there is no evidence that phones were ever put in anywhere, why bring it up? From a storytelling perspective, it does nothing.	20141130T132156

godlessgam3r	4	0	The thing I always think about when this is hypothesized is does a young Jay, in 1999 think there's a chance that the police will ever even look at the cell phone records. I'm not very certain he would think that foreword or even know its something that can be done. But lets say he does, why contact Jenn so much that day, also implicating her. While this doesn't debunk anything I think it makes it unlikely that Jay used phone calls or records to frame Adnan (that is to say pre-emptivley before any police contact).	20141130T063231
grey24	1	0	"I was thinking Jay and someone else could have made the call -- with someone else quickly saying ""Hey talk to Jay"" and handing the phone over. It can be hard to distinguish male voices, especially on those old cell phones. It could have been done to frame Adnan, although that might be a stretch. It never seemed super believable that Adnan called Nisha then randomly had Jay talk to her for a few minutes. Who does that without a purpose? I suppose Jay could be talking to Nisha about some drug deal or something, but if not, why have Jay talk to her on such a short call?"	20141130T043223
ludoc	1	0	I also thought about that. 1. Maybe Jenn was just the absolute necessity to solve the two-car problem? Someone should pick him up and he could not avoid contacting her. 2. Maybe he tried to pretend that he's with Adnan and actually made a conversation with Nisha? Maybe Nisha somehow mixes it up with another call later. 3. Maybe he was too panicked to think straight?	20141130T231109
lkshmi108	1	0	"I completely agree. I think that Jay wanted to frame Adnan. I think that was why he did it. He wanted to establish that they were together.

godlessgam3r	1	0	If the murder was not premeditated, he panics after the murder, says hey I will call this contact on Adnan's phone to frame him, cause the police will likely look at the call records. Then he cant erase the calls to Jenn he has already made. Needs to make another for a hiccup he has run into. If its premeditated he would not have made all the calls to Jenn knowing about the call records. But this is all assuming he knew that the police could and would likely look at the call records, and he thought of this in a panic.	20141201T054943
grey24	1	0	I'm glad you agree! Doesn't seem like many others do, though. Or has this been brought up before and I didn't see it?	20141201T034204
lkshmi108	1	0	I think you're right. Landlines were traceable then so it would be in his awareness that cell phones would be too.	20141201T134220
lkshmi108	1	0	not sure either, but it makes complete sense and I thought it as soon as it was brought up. I had my first cell phone in 1999, the reception was not nearly as clear as it is now and it was a big joke that people would fake that they were getting bad reception to get out of a call.	20141201T121150

The_Chairman_Meow	48	0	I think that's exactly what he did after he killed Hae. That would explain the Nisha call. Oh, what was I doing that afternoon? I was hanging out with my buddy Jay. I even called this girl Nisha. Hey, as a matter of fact, Jay talked to her too. You can ask them! Jay dropped me off at track practice right after I talked to Nisha. When Jay confessed his involvement, the Nisha and Jay alibi blew up in his face. Then Asia offered an alibi, but he probably knew it was inaccurate so he didn't want to push on that load-bearing wall.	20141130T035458
8shadesofgray	19	0	He either did not have alibis in mind or he was INSANELY bad at it. Jay or not: - He makes sure plenty of people see him asking Hae for a ride, despite the fact that he could have asked her on the phone the previous evening. Then he seems to tell two different police officers two different stories about whether this did or did not happen, rather than using those 6 weeks to come up with a plausible reason that people are remembering what they did. - Even after it becomes clear that the State's case hinges on the minutes right after school lets out, he doesn't push his attorney to track down Asia, nor does he share her letters with anyone until he talks to Rabia the day of his conviction. - He shows up extremely late to class and the teacher makes a notation of it (per the Serial timeline). - He very easily could have shown up at track late, and regardless, he didn't do anything to cause anyone to remember he was there, nor could he seem to recall it clearly or emphatically when asked about his whereabouts by police. - If we're to accept Jay and Jenn's version of events, he shows up well after he's expected to be at the mosque that evening. - But he does make sure to stop by a total stranger's house and make a memorable scene and say some suspicious things on the phone. I feel pretty safe in saying, innocent or guilty, this is not a criminal mastermind at work.	20141130T080333
ravonin	10	0	Seems possible, because if that was the case, his entire day would pretty much have been accounted for: Sees Jay, goes to school, gets out of school, (some unaccountable time, possibly library), Jay picks him up, do stuff, make calls, smoke weed, gets dropped back off at track practice, get back with Jay, turns up at cathy's house, goes to the mall with Jay/mosque, goes home, makes more calls at the end of the evening. (sorry for any incorrect details) Yea, so if Jay helped him out with the alibi, he'd be almost totally covered. Then again, this says little to nothing about his guilt.	20141130T050728

No I mean, I had, I had no idea and the reaction that he gave me was like stop playing dumb.

barbaraalmeida	1	0	I believe Asia is telling the truth. The crime certainly didnt happen at 2:36, but somewhere between 3:30-4ish. krista? saw Hae at school after 2:40 and Asia saw Adnan in the library. So he could be at the library up until a few min after three. In Jay's transcripts, he says that Adnan tells him he was late for practice. Assuming J came clean and was telling the truth after all or partial truth, and Krista and Asia are also telling the truth, A could have killed between 3:30-4ish. He was a little late for practice. But I do think A took a very passive position to avoid more digging.	20141130T213820

HomeBrewThis	29	0	I agree with you in part, about trying to remember a narrative of the day. However, having multiple stories about where you saw a body is a big red flag. Add that on to the fact that the state showed Jay phone records and his story changed accordingly is a serious problem.	20141130T044613
anonymous	7	0	As someone who has not really been convinced either way yet, I have to say I enjoy reading takes from people with different perspectives here and elsewhere online - especially ones that have an eye for detail and are thorough. If the authors want to shade in between the facts with their own analysis, I'm fine with it. This is a case that doesn't have a whole lot of physical evidence, and so there is a lot of analysis to be had. Honestly, if someone put together a similar detailed analysis that added credence to the theory that Adnan did commit the murder, I would probably read it with just as much interest. I think the main thing to take away from these blog posts is that Jay has lied a lot, about a lot, sometimes at pretty critical times in the narrative, and that is pretty suspicious. It's not proof of anything, but he did admit involvement in the coverup of the murder so it begs the question whether or not he *could* have committed the murder and coverup (mostly?) by himself. The way I look at it is the author is simply trying to answer that question and take the angle of providing an alternate theory of the crime. Of course, there are still enough gaps in Adnan's timeline that make him pretty suspicious too. We just don't have enough information to make a definitive judgement either way, which is what makes plausible theories interesting to read.	20141130T135458
anonymous	14	0	> The testimony is confusing, possibly because they are recreating the events in their heads with no notes or a diary to help them. No, not really. It's confusing because it doesn't make sense. I read over and over about how it was just insane for Adnan Syed to be unable to remember his afternoon activities on Jan 13, because it was such an important day in his life, the day a cop called him to say that his ex gf was unaccounted for for 3 hours. Wouldn't every normal person right away start going over their day to make sure they knew where they had been and when on such an important day??? Ahem. But this nonsensical telling of what had to have been an unforgettable experience is completely understandable, because Jay had no notes to help him remember *where exactly he was when a dead girl was being put into a hole in the ground.* Hmmm. Sitting on a log having a smoke? Or waiting in a car up the road? It just escapes him, poor guy, because he didn't have any notes to help him remember exactly how it went. Geebus, people. This isn't about minimizing his involvement. This is about inventing a narrative that never happened.	20141130T074316

Susan's first document is presented to us as an impartial recounting of facts, but it quickly becomes apparent upon reading it that it is no such thing. It is a recounting of various testimonies that are untrustworthy for one reason or another, and then a drawing of conclusions from said testimonies. In fact I have to say that one of the most frustrating aspects of this subreddit is that Susan's document is taken by many as literally the objective truth about this case. I should add that I do appreciate that Susan has put a lot of work into this document, that it does contain many important facts about the case, and I have found it useful as a reference myself.	20141130T052619

Why didn't Jay go right to the cops? Or Jen? Or anyone else Jay spoke to? There's a lot of weirdness, but none of it exonerates Adnan or makes Jay 100% truthful.

EngineerinLA	6	0	"Backed up every word? Kinda like every post that everyone who writes here does. She reads the transcripts one way, and professional investigators (the one Serial had) says that this is how investigations go. Witnesses lie, suspects lie, cops lie. What was presented at trial is what the prosecutors were able to piece together from the detectives. Adnan's attorney had access to all of the recorded interviews from Jay, it's called discovery. Now perhaps Ms. Gutierrez didn't think that the prosecutors could make a coherent narrative happen, but they did. She didn't present a rebuttal except to attack Jay. We've gone over dozens of times about how memory is extremely malleable, and that links from certain events can cause people to misremember. Even eyewitnesses with no reason to lie can get what they saw wrong. I'm not saying Adnan is innocent, and I'm not saying Jay's testimony was ironclad enough to convict. But I wasn't a juror, and I'm not related to anyone in the case (I've never even been to Baltimore). But I can say that Serial hired an expert to review, and he said that there's more to Jay's story, but there was obviously enough to convict, given how poorly the defense was in court. This is something I'm willing to entertain (shitty strategy by the defense - possible inadequate defense).

So unless you are Ms. Simpson (and I would expect more from her, she's anything but short winded and does bother with punctuation and capitalization), why don't you come up with something else to contribute except ad hominem attacks!

That being said there are two critical points that are very problematic: 1: Adnan's guilt relies wholly on an unreliable narrator. Jay's testimony is the ONLY testimony against Adnan, and it is severely flawed, inconsistent, and he was coached by police. 2: The only connection to Hae's murder that has been independently verifies has been the location of the body, car, and method. All provided by Jay. So...you have ONE witness, who is a known liar, and was fed a timeline by the police. I don't know what Jay's motive could be.

He was flirty with his girlfriend or some such? I keep trying to place all of this into the context of the 19 year old Brain which is still developing. I can see teenagers ""planning"" a murder while being high (all the time, from the sounds of it) without ever using that part of your Brain which thinks through all the various consequences that arise from one's actions. Flash forward to Adnan actually carrying out the Murder and Jay is all of sudden presented with a real world situation that deep down he didn't anticipate ever happening. He follows through with his agreement with Adnan to help out, all the while feeling conflicted and confused. It wasn't till outside influence discovered the crime that he felt compelled to talk to the police. Because sure, now the whole situation is real.

EngineerinLA	6	0	Fair enough. My reads: 1: Adnan's guilt relies wholly on an unreliable narrator that the detectives at the time read as reliable enough; verified by a detective hired by Serial. He's also potentially someone who was blackmailed into being involved in a murder, during which the entire time he was probably stressed out and high. So unreliable memory, sounds about right to me. 2: Mr. S. provided the location of the body. Independently verifiable. Adnan's cell puts him in Leakin Park, when the body was purportedly being buried, instead of at the mosque where he says he was. Adnan can't explain where he was when Hae was killed or when she was buried. So we have one witness who's story was shaped by the cops (how else can someone even create a timeline 6 weeks later - Episode 1 anyone?), and a defendant who had opportunity and motive (insert obligatory ex lover motives that everyone else has posted dozens of times and the letters between Hae and Adnan about his mindset not being over Hae). We have a defendant that was possibly stalking his ex gf (he calls her obsessively after her date, possibly while going to Downtown Baltimore for some unexplained reason?) or at the very least keeping tabs on her. And we have Jay's stories. Do we have anything else from Adnan or anyone else? What about that serial killer everyone was so hot to trot about a week ago? Said it once, I'll say it again: I think Adnan deserves a new trial. One where more physical evidence is considered. I think the Innocence Project might provide this for Adnan. I don't think Jay's testimony was enough, but I also don't think his testimony is a pure fabrication.	20141130T060334

Unfortunately for Adnan, he (potentially) chose to lie, as a result we are left with second hand info from Jay. As for whether or not I think someone who committed a murder should be behind bars for a very long time, or potentially the rest of their lives? I think so. A 17 year old showing enough signs and steps of plotting a murder probably should be institutionalized. Maybe not for life, but for a longgg (three g's) time. It's funny.

ViewFromLL2	21	0	Hi there. I don't want to wade in on anything else, but I did want to clarify that I am absolutely not connected to any party involved in this case. I'm not even a Maryland attorney. LL2 is just a personal blog where I write about the things I like to research. I promise that if I were representing any party involved in the matter, in any way, I would not be posting about it on my blog. And also if I were being paid to write about it, anything I did write would be at least 75% less sarcastic in tone. But you are right about me being anything but short-winded, that is truth.	20141130T060805
anonymous	5	0	"That is simply not true. She is putting a *slant* on events. Let me give you just one simple example from this document (the first one). On Call 3, Susan says the following: > The fact that Jay calls ""Jenn Home"" shows, once again, that Jay is not at Jenns house, as both Jay and Jenn claim agreed ... but then she continues ... > the fact this call pings a tower five miles to the east of Jenn's house ... also shows that **Jay is not at Jenn's that afternoon** This **cannot** be deduced from the facts she presents. Once can conclude that Jay is almost certainly not at Jenn's at 12:41 and for a while after. But to say that Jay does not return to Jenn's later that afternoon is not a deduction. It is an assumption. My point is, it is an assumption presented as an objective fact. There are many occurrences like this right throughout the document. PS: I actually happen to be of the opinion that Jay was never at Jenn's place that afternoon, but that is irrelevant to the point I am making."	20141130T062545

anonymous	11	0	I could see that being the case. But I think that (especially once we accept that Jay's a liar and his story is largely nonsense), Adnan's innocence really does come into question. The biggest thing against him right now (as far as I can see) is that he can't pinpoint his location at the time of the burial. That + Jay's testimony (which we can't be certain of at this point) means that I really don't feel comfortable saying he's guilty. I really don't know though. sigh...	20141130T051337

FeelinGarfunkelly	8	0	At some point I have to wonder what does it matter where Jay saw the body in the trunk? Or if Adnan was at the mosque? Jay saw the body somewhere (and maybe was the killer). Adnan being at mosque only means he wasn't present for the burial, but it does not mean he didn't kill Hae.	20141130T055732
EngineerinLA	10	0	I'm not saying the inconsistencies in his stories (yes plural) aren't concerning. He's obviously trying to 1) minimize his role to avoid going to prison and 2) make sure that his story supports what the cops are telling him they know. In light of that, and the fact that literally everyone's memory is not photographic or reliable for recalling very specific details (Watch Brain Games on NatGeo!) leads me to believe that he will lie to minimize his role and support the cop's case. What this doesn't do is throw out the consistencies in Jay's story. Nitpicking the details doesn't make the whole thing irrelevant or blatantly false. In an ideal world, Jay gets some jail time because the cops did follow up behind his back to get some evidence he was more involved than he says he was. Then we get the real story out of Jay (because the cops have him up shit creek needing a paddle to get less than life as a willing accessory before the fact). This would be what I would have hope to have happen or could possibly happen (not going to hold my breath).	20141130T053827

anonymous	9	0	Interesting, I don't see the note as suspicious at all - I actually wrote a post about that a few days ago. And personally, I buy the idea that he was calling her the night before to give her his cell number. The shifting story about the ride is definitely suspicious. I might be able to let it go given that it was (I think?) his only/one of his only inconsistencies (a couple of inconsistencies can be considered relatively normal). So I could see that going either way. Same with the not paging Hae after her death. The only *definitive* issues for me are his lack of alibi for track and his lack of alibi for the mosque. Again, I could accept one of these (the reasons why he could have been at either unnoticed do make sense), but to accept both is stretching it a little. This isn't to say he's lying about one or both, just that he really, really needs an alibi for at least being at mosque.	20141130T052953

mixingmemory	5	0	I don't know that it does go both ways. Adnan had one inconsistency, about asking for a ride. Other than that, he has claimed not to remember pretty much anything. If you think he did it, he does remember and he's a liar. If you think he might be innocent, he's probably telling the truth. Jay remembers everything in great detail, he just completely changed his narrative, apart from Adnan committing murder and a burial taking place that night, at least 4 times. And with most of his changes, he admitted to lying about things before. Not misremembering, lying.	20141130T173549

anonymous	2	0	Also, it's plausible that Adnan wouldn't remember all the events of the day, if he is innocent. We *know* that Jay was involved, though, so he has much less of an excuse to be forgetful. Not knowing the details to a regular day is one thing (and if Adnan is innocent than it was an almost-normal day), but mixing up and admitting to lying about the details of a day when you were *definitely* involved in a murder is another.	20141130T190903

I think that, for now, it's better for people to look at the big issues and the broader patterns.

Edit: The kind Muslim folks of this subreddit have pointed out that it is not difficult to get a divorce, and I have edited my post to reflect that. I thank them for the tutelage in this subject.

Glitteranji	11	0	Getting divorced has no bearing whatsoever on how 'good' a muslim you are. There's nothing against divorce at all, life happens. It's no more odd or confusing than a civil divorce. Which I actually found more difficult. My civil divorce took three years and was a huge PITA. Yes, reconciliation is encouraged, and many family and friends will be really sad about it, but it happens all the time. But ultimately, it is in no way a reflection on how devout or faithful you are.	20141130T061718

C-JaneJohns	3	0	Sorry, the wording isn't meant to be offensive (though I can see how it could come off that way). What I meant was that when people are following the strict faith path, as Adnan has implied, they are bound to sets of rules like ṭalāq and khula. In prison would it not be difficult to follow such proceedings? My understanding (from friends and classes) is that these need to be followed pretty strictly for such things to happen. Let me again state that this isn't meant to be offensive, I would have the same reaction to someone in prison who proclaimed that they were now an upstanding Christian if it came out that they had married and divorced.	20141130T055456

C-JaneJohns	-1	0	> How would any of this make him a bad muslim? Being divorced doesn't make you a bad person. Whoa! Not what I said! What I am trying to say (though maybe not clearly) is that usually when prisoners dedicate themselves to their religion (or a religion) they take it very seriously. It seems odd that someone who has stated this multiple times, and has stated how serious his parents are about relationships, and how much he wants to please them, has a prison marriage and divorce. In the Muslim religion alone there are some strict sharia laws that needs to be followed that would be difficult to do in prison (pronouncements, waiting periods, counseling, etc.) Now you have a point that she may have done all of that and just left, but it would still be pretty odd. For instance was she herself Muslim, and if not, wouldn't his family have difficulty with that? I *never* stated being divorced made someone a bad person, good grief. Edits: I didn't make this clear enough I think and that has caused some misunderstandings. I am only talking about familial *reaction* to marriage, not that the marriage has any strict laws attached to it. My understanding of divorce is that there is a waiting period between each time the man pronounces the divorce to the woman in front of witnesses. That there is then counseling between each of these periods. Also that it is more difficult for women to initiate the divorce than a man.	20141130T062709

saradahlia	3	0	I am not offended at all, merely was trying to clarify. Whether you strictly follow your faith or not, divorce is exactly the same in Islam. In fact its quite a speedy process, all that needs to take place is 1. verbally saying the words 2. filing the proceedings in court. Can be done same day. Only waiting occurs for women, they cant get remarried except after 3 months on account that they can possibly be pregnant and if they were they may decide to go back to their partner.

It was done because Hae witnessed something she wasnt supposed to, drug related and Jay was forced by third party to assist (several holes in my story, i cant even reconcile) 2. Adnan did it, has repented in Jail, now wants to get out of jail because he feels that his trial was not done justly and wants to be acquitted based on that. this explains his mannerisms (once again several holes in my story) what do you think?	20141130T101641

umairsemail	3	0	Muslims and Islam are different. Whoever said that most Muslims follow their religion down to the letter? Do Christians? Adnan used to drink and do drugs which are forbidden in Islam, see my point? Muslims and people of all faiths do things that are contrary to the core of their religions, but they're still Muslims by name. Very, very few Muslims follow their religion down to the letter.	20141202T201549

I also learned about a podcast called ""Diffused Congruence: the American Muslim Experience"" because the hosts recently interviewed Rabia: http://diffusedcongruence.podbean.com/e/episode-14-serials-rabia-chaudry/ Now I've started listening to other episodes of this excellent podcast.

C-JaneJohns	1	0	> Only waiting occurs for women, they cant get remarried except after 3 months on account that they can possibly be pregnant and if they were they may decide to go back to their partner. See my understanding was that there was a waiting period for both the man and the woman according to when the man made the pronouncement. Also that he has to state that they are divorced three times, in an interval, for it to be valid. This is all from reading about Sharia law in a class though (and I am in the USA) so it is possible the document was wrong (though that would be very unfortunate considering it was in a college class).	20141130T161208
ElizabethFamous	1	0	They're not going to be able to get back together if he remarries within 3 months. Why doesn't the rule apply to both men and women?	20141206T232323
C-JaneJohns	0	0	Yes, sorry again, wording, wording, wording. :-) My point was (and please interject on this) wouldn't it be odd for him to marry outside the religion (unless the inmate in question's sister was a Muslim) considering how strict his parents were about relationships etc? Then following that, to then get a divorce by either Tulaq or li'an, both of which need contact with the spouse through a designated time period? It seems off. Like I said I don't think it is *impossible* but it makes the story that he went to jail and is now a strictly devout Muslim a little bumpier. Again, I would have same disbelief for someone's marriage/divorce who was using their new found dedication to Christianity as a reason why they were okay with being in jail. It would seem very, off. I hope that makes better sense.	20141130T064222

mary_wv8633	2	0	So funny - just the other day I was thinking about something along the lines of your #1. I was like I bet Hae and possibly Stephanie knew something or were inadvertently involved in something they shouldn't have and Stephanie agreed to keep quiet or something, while Hae did not. Then I decided I had obviously watched too many Lifetime Movies. But given that Jay described himself as a big time pot dealer and seemed to be connected to deeper criminal elements, and it almost seemed that he had pre-arranged the day to frame Adnan. Fruthermore all the various stories we've heard about Hae's death, seeing the body, etc. have come from sources connected to Jay and only Jay. Odd. And the cell phone pinging - all the oddities except for Nisha - which could have been part of the framing on Jay's part - also connected to Jay. I'm biased, I admit, I think Adnan is innocent, but I also think Jay is SO MUCH MORE F--KING involved and I cannot believe he wasn't deeper investigated. And secondly, a point stuck out to me that they don't actually know if Hae was killed on the 13th. Hmmmm...	20141206T033802
anonymous	3	0	Exactly. Let's clear this up. I know of instances of (Muslims) people getting married in prison on a phone party-connection with the bride/groom/imam. Re divorce, I think there are some rulings which would suggest the woman could not initiate the divorce if the man was in prison but Maliki school teaches it is lawful. Depends on many things and the Schools in question. Also I assume Adnan is Sunni but if he is Shi'i then it is a very different picture and other factors could enter in.	20141130T103610
SeaHoarse	2	0	(This is coming from talking to cousins in Syria) I had heard that there are different periods of time depending on whether the...um, woman is in her menstrual cycle or not (it had something to do with confirming if a woman was pregnant).

C-JaneJohns	1	0	"As I just stated below, I didn't make that clear enough, I wasn't talking about getting married having strict laws, just divorce. My only discussion of marriage is how his family would react to it, not whether he could do it or not. I already wrote this (I think to you) that my very close family friends had some trouble with both of their families because one was a Christian and the other a Muslim. Everyone came around eventually but they did have to ""make a stand"" if you will, to get all parties on board. On the divorce part though, is it not true that men have an easier time pronouncing divorce than women? That was my understanding. Also that he does have to announce the divorce three times, and that there should be a period of time between these pronouncements? Also during these periods counseling should happen? My interpretation comes from a document I read about Sharia law back in undergrad, if it is wrong then that is fine, but I wasn't just making random statements. :)"	20141130T162608

saradahlia	3	0	the waiting period is only for women. he only needs to state i once, if he states it 3 times they can never remarry eachother	20141130T162802
saradahlia	3	0	The rule only applies to woman to give time in case she is pregnant, thus the three months, if a pregnancy is determined it is only in her power to go back to the husband. If she is pregnant, he cant tell her to come back, it is at her discretion.	20141207T052835
Glitteranji	1	0	The waiting time for women is to make sure she's not pregnant before marrying someone else. Men don't have to worry about being pregnant. If there were a pregnancy, they may wish to try harder to reconcile. They also may decide not to reconcile, but at this point, it will fully be known who the father is and who is then financially responsible for the child. So you don't get divorced and remarried immediately, then find out you're pregnant, and unable to determine if you're pregnant by your ex or your current husband. Then you could run into problems trying to determine paternity and having it turn into some kind of Maury Povich episode.	20141207T185008

saradahlia	3	0	i dont think u were making random statements. i think being immersed in the religion simply gives me an advantage to understanding it. i applaud u getting this far in ur detailed understanding. it is not easier vs harder, a woman can legally file for a divorce, a man can say it and it becomes valid, yet he still has to file for the paper work etc but once he says it its valid. Meaning he cant have relations with said wife. He says it 3 times only if he is sure he never wants to remarry her again, if he says it then decides he wants to be with her again (even if the papers have been filed) he can go back on that decision, but if he says it 3 times, she needs to marry someone else, get divorced, then be able to marry the first husband no need for time between pronouncements, or counselling, this is optional as is in any religion	20141130T163709
Glitteranji	1	0	"I'm glad you seem really hear felt in understanding things. I think some of the difficulty you are having is because your reference point is a particular document of sharia law that has stated certain things regarding marriage and divorce. The problem with that is, sharia is not an exact thing, much the same as other legal systems. It's not a single, stagnant document that applies to all people, at all times, in all places, in all of history. There are things that are set down, but are then open to interpretation and application. Different regions and different communities will have different applications of how some laws will work. There are also different sects of Islam, as well as a variety of schools of thought within each sect. Therefore, each different group is going to have legal and religious experts who study different laws, and work together on how to interpret and apply them. BTW, this is why I find it so absurd when I hear haters talking about how ""foreign"" the concept of democracy is to Muslims and the ""Muslim world"", and about how they will never be able to accept democracy because...mullahs and stuff. At it's heart, Islam is extremely democratic. Major decisions are typically made by consultation between a number of scholars. Anyway, to continue... Different sects and schools of thought are going to apply certain laws differently. There is not one set of authoritative documents that proscribe ""sharia law"" and how to enact it. This is comparable to legal systems in the United States. For example, there is no ""American Law"" that states that murderers have to be executed. However, there are a number of states that have, in fact, decided to execute murderers. That is how that state decided to mete out punishment for someone who has broken a law. The same works in sharia -- there is not some law that states someone has to be executed for breaking a particular law, but in some places, they will decide that execution is the punishment, while in another region the offender will be imprisoned. The same will hold true for laws regarding marriage. Not every sect or group is going to have the same application of law. Also, in some cases, they are working alongside civil law. There are also different forms of marriage within different groups of Muslims (but really, that's a whole 'nother story). To expect that one particular document that made statements about how marriage and/or divorce works is just not going to affect the majority of Muslims in the same way. It would be *somewhat* analagous to expecting that because the laws for marriage in your state would hold true in other stats or other countries."	20141207T192857

I only noticed a couple of instances of blatant leading in Jay's interview -- one of which was played on the podcast (the part about discussing where to bury the body while they were in Patapsco). This is probably why Jim Trainum, the false confession expert, saw this as a ""better than average"" investigation. If the police were shaping Jay's testimony, it would have had to happen in the pre-interview, and this wouldn't explain Jenn's corroboration of events, since she didn't speak to police without her lawyer. Sure, she and Jay could have colluded on their accounts, but that would also have been pre-police interview, so again the police conspiracy angle seems weak."	20141130T155202
anonymous	1	0	Because the story he was telling (which we know is not the complete truth) did not match the evidence the police actually had. His inconsistencies and lies suggest that he had something to hide, and by allowing him to change his story multiple times by giving him information from the cell phone records, the police essentially fed him information to nail Adnon.	20141130T145004
readybrek	1	0	Perhaps the way it happened was different to the way the cops thought Adnan had done it, so Jay was not being honest all the time because he wanted to minimise his involvement and protect others and the cops are feeding him information (which can be done accidentally, it's not necessarily a deliberate process) because they want him to implicate Adnan and Jay's initial story isn't working for them.	20141130T101038

TrillianSwan	2	0	From her police statement: >Lehmann: Excuse me, as long as we're on dates here, how are you so sure with all these events that you're talking about took place on the 13th of January? How do you know it wasn't the 14th, the 11th, 12th? >Jenn: Well **the only reason I know that is because last night um when I was being questioned or whatever you want to call it, um ah the question asked was why had Adnar [sic] called my house on the 13th, um I remember the incident that Adnar had killed Hae and I remember that I had talked to Jay that day and Jay had been at my house**. Adnar has never called my house before, best to my recollection. Um not that I would remember, he never called my house and ah so the only time that he would have called the house would have been on the 13th. Like I believe I said I had those phone calls come to my house. [Earlier in the statement Jenn says she doesn't know on the day this happened that it's Adnan's car and phone. She doesn't know who calls Jay at her house, on cell or landline. She has talked to Jay in the meantime and has guessed or Jay might have told her that the call to her house (~3:30 or so) was Adnan, but she apparently doesn't know it for sure, because she doesn't include that in her statement on this day.] >Lehmann: So you're saying you're sure it's the 13th **because we told you you had those telephone calls on the 13th**? >Jenn: Right. >Lehmann: Not because it's the day after [Jay's] birthday, or >Jenn: Right.

anonymous	4	0	But this says nothing and of itself; it can be read both ways. I bet if any of us had to account for exact times on a given day, the first thing we would do is look at our phones/calendars/email in order to remember with more precision. If Jay is telling a story that is basically true, it makes sense that the cell records would help him remember. To me, this is not at all compelling evidence that Jay was fed his story to fit the police narrative -- besides, his times never do precisely match the call records; even at trial, he's about an hour off. If he was mostly fed his narrative by police, wouldn't it fit the log better?	20141130T173926
readybrek	2	0	It's very clear that *after* he saw the evidence he remembered things a lot better. I can't really imagine a more smoking gun like that. You would think Jay's evidence would fit the phone log perfectly but he really stuck to his guns that he was at Jenn's all afternoon when he couldn't have been according to the phone logs. Maybe the cops thought it was good enough and fitted the murder scenario and burial scenario well enough.	20141130T181531

8shadesofgray	7	0	For what it's worth, Jay's description of Hae's clothes were remarkably similar in his first and second interview - one of the few really strong consistencies in his narrative, actually. But no, I don't think we've heard a description of her clothing from anyone else at this point.	20141130T074527
ilovecherries	3	0	As with any missing person, I would imagine news reports would have included a somewhat detailed description of what she was wearing when last seen. My guess is Jay's vivid testimony of her clothing comes from hearing these reports over and over in days after Hae was reported missing. &nbsp; Note: I don't think that means he's lying about seeing her body, just that it explains why he had such detailed recollection of the clothes she was wearing.	20141130T150654

goodgord	5	0	Yeah, it's a bit far-out (and maybe a little Breaking Bad), but I kind of like this theory. It explains the motive - neither Adnan nor Jay really wanted Hae dead, yet they both ended up with a body to bury.

goliath_franco	6	0	"It's hard to imagine why Adnan would hide all of this, though. Murder versus a drug deal? Plus, he could have told the story in a way that left out the drugs, like ""I gave Hae some money to give to Jay because Jay loaned me some money the week before."""	20141130T064900
anonymous	4	0	Whether or not the majority of your theory works, I've always suspected that a possible reason Adnan lent Jay his Car/Cell without much thought was because they were both profiting from Jay using it to run orders.	20141130T085609

romelaw	5	0	I'm thinking that, whether Jay was the one that killed her or not, he would tell people that Hae was killed by some very serious gangster. He'd probably say that Hae was killed by his connect, and that person said that if anyone even began to speak of their involvement they'd kill their family. It would explain why everyone is still so freaked out to this day. It could explain why someone like Asia would be so willing to offer an alibi in the early days, but recanted later. It'd be hard to believe that the police WOULD protect someone's entire family just based on 2nd hand telling of some gangster having killed Hae. I could see Adnan have a strong sense of guilt over being the reason Hae was there at all. Additionally, it could be argued that he was just as culpable in her murder for having arranged for her to be there. It's something that's dicey enough for someone not well versed in the law, to keep their mouth shut thinking they'd implicate themselves in Hae's murder.	20141130T065815
Jerkovin	3	0	Exactly. It makes perfect sense that he would lend Jay his car to do his business, and Jay would, in turn, sort him out with pot and smoke with him. Seems like a mutual beneficial agreement, and far better for Adnan, a student, than having to pay money.	20141130T161900
romelaw	2	0	"Adnan barely even says Jay is out and out lying. I can totally see someone in his position being more worried about his family, than even getting out of prison. Not to mention, he's keenly away of how ""self servings"" statements make him appear.

anonymous	3	0	Jay lived at his grandma's house with hardened criminals. If the cell tower data is reliable at all, he was there around 12:30-12:45 on the day of the murder. We're talking more dangerous drugs and violent crimes. I'm willing to take Jay's stories about crazy shit happening at that house at face value. Who's to say he didn't bring someone with him to Jenn's and when he drove back up to the school after the 2:36 call?	20141130T084433
romelaw	3	0	There's lots of people that believe that Jay did it. He was just some small time dealer. Who knows the type of people he was dealing with. I've heard about people getting killed over a ton less than holding up a drug deal. If you're just dropping off something, I don't think you'd expect it to take unreasonably long. I don't know. I think this explanation makes a ton more sense then it being about jealousy and love. It's funny because NOBODY is really touting this as a crime of passion. I think it's because it really wasn't.	20141130T072440
goliath_franco	2	0	Why were there hardened criminals (several of them) living at Jay's Grandma's house?	20141130T085554
goliath_franco	3	0	It's actually not a horrible alternative theory, but then you've got to figure out why Jay starts framing Adnan immediately after Hae's murder. How does Jay know that Adnan doesn't have an alibi? Why would Jay tell Stephanie to keep away from Adnan? Why wouldn't Jay just keep his mouth shut about the whole thing? That would be a lot safer for everyone involved (especially because Mr. Söze could legitimately kill everyone who talks). Ultimately, though, the biggest problem is that there's no evidence in support of this theory.	20141130T074016

romelaw	1	0	I think that if you don't believe Adnan committed the murder, it's obvious that Jay was actually with Hae at some point. How else would Jay get in touch with Hae to facilitate that interaction? She was in school and didn't have a cell like Adnan.

romelaw	3	0	You're right. However, in my idea of it, he might or might not actually exist. I could totally see Hae having balked and Jay killing her out of necessity or frustration. However, Jay even using a Gangster Straw Man, would drive home the fear of talking. Adnan would likely rather take the hit for Hae's murder, being that he had a hand in it, than put his family in danger.	20141130T075905

anonymous	2	0	I'm curious about the rocks that were discussed also covering Hae's body. How large were the rocks? Were they native to that part of the park?

I know I'm not answering or really providing any more information to this topic, just asking more questions. But the very presence of the rocks on Hae's body don't really get touched on a lot on the podcast.	20141130T065421
prettikitti89	2	0	I speculate that Adnan and Jay hadn't planned on having to get rid of the body that quickly. It was only after the cops called did they realize people were already looking for Hae.

Dysbrainiac	12	0	your points are mostly speculation. Now ignoring what Jay says regarding Adnan these are the concrete things we have. What we have against Adnan is: 1 He's the ex boyfriend thus statistically a likely perpetrator (many easily construed motives). 2. A plausible explanation exist that puts him in Haes car after school 3. No clear alibi 4. A consistent testimony of the day but one that are full of holes. However, when it's specific it fits cell phone record. But it is only specific during times were events are not significant to Haes murder/burial. 5. A strange call to Niesha no one can fully explain. 6. Jays friend Jenn, ie the other suspects friend, say she saw Adnan with Jay after they allegedly buried the body. Jay claims this did not happen. What we have against Jay: 1. Jay knew where Haes car was. 2. Jay knew somehow forensic details about the instance Hae was killed ( broken windshield wiper on off stick). 3. A witness and a confession of him getting rid of evidence. 4. A confession that the tools used to bury Hae were his. 5. Around the time Hae was killed all calls to Adnans cell pinged the tower next to woodland high, and by confession, Jay was in possession of said phone. 6. The first call made after 3:15, ie after Hae most likely had been killed, was to Jenn. A person that would make sense for Jay to call because, by her own confession, she is a person who would help, and did help, Jay to get rid of evidence in a murder case. 7. All calls but one( to Niesha) until the call to voicemail, that occurred at a time that would fit with Adnan being picked up after track (according to the coach and other team members), are to Jays friends. 8. During the time of the burial all calls made are to Jenn, a friend of Jay, who confesses to helping him getting a way with a felony. And who makes social calls while burying a body? No calls to Niesha or other friend of Adnan. 9. Jay confesses to burying Hae. 10. The only other possible suspect, who Jay says it was, left no forensic trace on Hae and no forensic evidence was found at his house. Does really inconsistent testimonies, full of admitted lies, from one of the main suspect of this murder, who if it were him would gain a lot by pinning it on someone else really shift the balance here?

EngineerinLA	3	0	"Point 11 is interesting to me. Why did he ask for a ride if he had no where to go until after track practice? And even if Jay has his car he should get it back after practice. Why would Adnan play it cool about his relationship with Jay and then admit to hanging out with him a lot? I don't know about Adnan being manipulative. If I was trying to convince people of my innocence (if I was truly innocent), I think I'd be pretty damned convincing. So I say like others have, someone ""sounding"" like something isn't much to go on. Go on what they said they did, or what there's evidence of what they did. But be careful inferring your own feelings into how they sounded. That's armchair psychoanalysis not armchair sleuthing."	20141130T073547
anonymous	11	0	"If Adnan did it, what would your timeline for the murder be? > Adnan was a killer who couldnt control his urges any longer To imply that Adnan had urges to be a killer seems to imply some kind of psychopathy. To get into a debate about this would involve a lot of armchair psychology, but from my impression of violent tendencies, if Adnan were really a psychopath or something he probably would have shown signs as he grew up. There's no mention of him hurting small animals, being violent toward his siblings/family, being violent toward his classmates. If anything, Jay is the one with stories of violence in his past(he tried to stab his friend to prove a point? WTF?) The most disturbing thing we can point to before the murder is he is perhaps possessive of Hae- constantly dropping in on her. Given they were teenagers, you could just point to insecurity and good ol' teenage immaturity for this one. You could argue that any disturbing stories about Adnan were forgotten or ignored because most people don't look for signs of being a killer in their kid unless the behavior is particularly horrible, but there's just no proof. > There were testimonies from people in adnan's community that were ""off the record"" because they feared what their community would do to them Depends on what you mean by Adnan's community. Who is defending Adnan? The Muslim community did not defend Adnan because he was a teenage pot-smoker having premarital sex.

anonymous	3	0	I see 2 main problems with your theory: 1. It relies on the proud tradition of this sub of 'a killer would/wouldn't.' Unless you are a criminologist, your opinion on what a killer would or would not do is not useful. 2. >No person would lie about killing someone and seeing the body and being involved unless most of it was true. This is factually incorrect. There are hundreds, probably thousands, of stories of the police convincing/coercing people to confess to horrible things that they did not do. Jay's confession is nothing compared to some of these stories.	20141130T173931
maniacman6	9	0	1. The podcast actually would be more entertaining and serve more of a purpose if Adnan didn't do it - imagine the future downloads if Adnan is acquitted. 2. By all accounts the cops did a very thorough job of investigating 4 possible suspects and gathering appropriate evidence. Adnan could not have possibly planned for shady cops or a less than diligent lawyer. 4. Not sure where you are getting that Adnan was a killer who couldn't control his urges because wouldn't that have shown up in at least 1 prison fight/altercation in the 15 years since? 5. You cannot possibly say how every person would act in every situation. While I agree it is extremely unusual and not something I would do; this is the main problem I see with individuals. They project their own thoughts and acts onto other people when not everybody acts the same in a given situation. There are countless examples of people admitting to things they haven't done, feel free to google them and research them because there are A LOT. 8. see # 4 10. I believe this to be what happened but obviously it's just my opinion as well 11. if you think Adnan has manipulated you then wouldn't you believe he didn't do it?	20141130T062226

anonymous	1	0	Your theory is not impossible, but cops convince people to admit to serious crimes they did not commit all the time. Literally the time. So I do not agree with you about that point. People have been falsely convicted of murder all the time due to false confessions. It is why DNA exonerations have taken off. The amount of time Jay spent with the police makes his testimony and taped statements virtually meaningless to me for this reason.	20141130T200259
textrovert	1	0	"On #5, isn't that a point in the ""Jay is guilty"" column and not the other way around? Adnan has *never* claimed to be involved. You should rephrase this ""no one would claim to be *more* involved than they were. It only makes sense for someone to lie about being *less* involved than they were."" That applies to Jay as well as Adnan. Which means that Jay was *at least* as involved as he says. And unlike Adnan, his story of his *level* of involvement has varied quite drastically while Adnan's has stayed constant. It is not plausible that Jay is *less* involved than he says, but it is quite plausible that he is *more* involved. Overall it seems that you're willing to explain away all that implicates Jay, and over-read everything that implicates Adnan. Take away what both of them simply *say* happened. Neither of their accounts are reliable or credible. All we have then is that they were not seen together that day until 6pm, Asia says she saw Adnan in the library at 2:30 or so, Jay was the only one talking about Hae's murder to anyone and the only one Jenn saw with the shovel, and the only one who displayed inside knowledge of what happened to Hae to police or anyone else."	20141130T221611

captnyoss	1	0	And the other point to make around #5 is that Jay was clearly involved in some way.

Nutbrowndog	2	0	This is really good. It's very compelling and upticks me toward Jay being the one. I still have a lot of logistical problems with him being the lone killer or he and Jenn being the ones. The tricky things is why Jenn would come forward at all if Adnan wasn't around like she says he was with shovels and what not. Let's assume Jay is lying to her. Either she believes him against all reason or she knows he's guilty. If she's protecting Jay, either way, why come forward with Jay's story and not just leave her knowledge of it out? She was talking to Jay on Adnan's phone. She was at work, driving her parents around, making plans to meet up with friends including Jay. Done. By the same token, for Jay, why cop to anything? They have nothing in way of evidence against him--no forensics, nothing without the car and the story. It is beyond reason for him to admit to anything if he's the mastermind and killer. Riddle me that because it's what I can't get past.	20141130T192613

anonymous	3	0	Yeah, all evidence seems to point to the fact that at one point his lawyer definitely had a reputation for solid work, even if it was characterized by an over-the-top Nancy Grace-esque quality that we all find kind of off-putting these days. I don't think enough has been made about the fact that she was sick - very sick in fact - and I'm sure that played a role in her ability to effectively handle this case. At worst, I think a case could be made that she just wasn't in top form to handle a trial like this one, by that point in her career.	20141130T170843
EsperStormblade	5	0	"People keep saying ""he showed now signs of violence before."" How do we know? Do you think Adnan's family, his community, would come out and tell us if Adnan had a thing for killing cats or whatever as a kid? Do you think anyone who would know would show up and tell us he had a temper at home or anything like that? *Of course not.* We already know that his Dad was pretty liberal with the truth, testifying that Adnan was at mosque from 7:30-10:30--even though cell records show that Adnan was pretty much on the phone from 9pm until later that night. I'm sure he ""showed his face"" at mosque; but he certainly wasn't there until 10:30 praying. Now, perhaps that was just an oversight on his father's part. But isn't it possible there are other oversights? And even if some people know--who do you think will break ranks and tell you/us/SK? Look at what happened on this sub when someone tried to point to him being a little scarier than we've been led to believe. That person was accused of being a pedophile by Rabia and Saad. Whether it is true or not is kind of immaterial, since the person is free and posting on the internet. It was mentioned on that thread that this person's ""crimes"" were handled internally by the community. Do you think same said community would be posting far and wide about Adnan's violent or disturbing tendencies? *I think not...* So all we can say is that Adnan doesn't have a record of *official* violence. Neither did Jeffrey Dahmer. (We found out about his disturbing childhood stuff after the fact.) Neither did Ted Bundy. In 1999, Jay also had no record of violent infractions. (He does now as many on this sub have been eager to point out. But in 1999, he didn't. And who is to say what Adnan's record would look like if he'd eluded jail?) All I'm saying is, we don't really know about Adnan's ""history of violence"" because being only 17, the people who would know best are his family and close community members...and they ain't talkin'."	20141130T144508

Dysbrainiac	2	0	I find it construed. nice job though. Personally I believe that the 60x towers pinged on the 12:th are possibly macrocells. That is cell covering larger areas, up to 20 miles. Thats why they are numbered differently, knowing engineers the numbers off the cells have some sort of system to it. It could be geographic area, such as Baltimore City vs county though. Just worthless speculation though because neither of these calls will not crack the case and can be explained in to many ways. The route taken to best buy, if this even is a important location in the true story, is surely irrelevant to everything except the states case, including yours.	20141130T170128
izatty42	2	0	"he confessed to Jenn - we know for fact some part of it, that he ""helped"" Adnan. What if he did not trust Jenn to keep quiet?

His only shot is to ""confess"" that Adnan did it and he helped."	20141130T200420
Dysbrainiac	1	0	Simple, Jenn is scared of the police. Remember initially she does not say anything. However after some pondering she knows she is in trouble. Either way she will possibly get accused of helping either Adnan or Jay. She doesn't know what to do, asks Jay who has been thinking about this for a month. Police interest need to be deflected from Jenn so she doesn't make a deal with the police and spills the beans. Only chance now is to admitt everything apart from the murder. Remember Jenn is not Adnans friend and police will soon find out she's Jays friend and that he had the phone during the day. People might have seen him in Adnans car, corroborating Adnan? He called Phil and Patrick too! Forensics might pull something linking him to the burial scene or to Haes car went they find it? Who know if the shovels will turn up? They will soon start focusing on him, remember they have nothing on Adnan but an anonymous phone call. What would Jenns and/or his phone record have showed?	20141130T202705

Hopper80	3	0	Maybe we don't know anything about Adnan's 'history of violence' because he doesn't have one? As to Jay, we do know he tried to stab his friend because said friend hadn't been stabbed before. We don't really know anything. That is a big problem. I have seen a few speculations as to how that day played out - one of them being yours - that I have found persuasive. These theories were mutually exclusive. That is, Adnan could not both have killed Hae and had nothing to do with her murder. Because we don't really know anything. We have shifting testimonies from someone who admitted to lying, and we have minimal testimony from someone who says he can't remember much of anything - both these things strike some as suspicious and others as understandable. Similarly, we have various character moments that strike some as definitely unusual and others as perfectly normal. Some hear about the stabbing thing and think, 'what the fuck?'. Others respond that, yeah, it's pretty much normal teenage boy messing about stuff. Same with lending out one's car and phone - either really weird and suggestive of something, or quite understandable. The one solid piece of data we have is the call log from Adnan's phone for that day, the tower pings apparently being of debateable usefulness. We then have the witness statements outside of Adnan/Jay/Jenn, which are as credible as the individual speculator may find them, and we have the character moments that may be a particular unpleasant/dangerous characteristic, or may be a fairly normal part of non-worrisome person's psychological tableaux. This is why there's been able to be such a rich variety of theories as to what happened - there are an awful lot of stories that can be constructed to cover the few facts we have, with no particular reason to consider one more plausible than the other aside from our own pespectives. There is so little in the way of data against which to test the theories, to find them either accurate or wanting. Few here know Adnan or Jay, now or then. I doubt any of us has sat down and done a psychologically probing interview with them. They have a rough outline, onto which can be projected many a feasible psychological make-up. Sociopath or patsy. Fantasist 'criminal element' or murderer. Take your pick. The detectives were sure they had their man. They pursued him, with little interest in considering other possibilities, or in, say, pulling in more phone records so they could cross check who called who when that day, to pin down the stories from Jay and Jenn with the phone calls they say they made and recieved, see if they can find out who was calling in on Adnan's phone. Unfortunately, for those of us who look at the prosecution's case and see reasonable doubt, or just see why others do, and then want to try and work out what did happen that day, that means a one way ticket to Speculation City. *Edited to add a few things I skipped over when in the fervour of typing.	20141130T173446
Nutbrowndog	2	0	Someone from his community did come forward on this reddit and Rabia and others worked very hard to discredit this person. What this person had to say about Adnan was troubling. I already found it a stretch that he was an average teenager--but after this I found him to bit of a delinquent if it's true. There's no way to know what the motive was for the person who spoke out-if he was making it up for some reason but it's clear he knew Adnan.	20141130T191355

Nutbrowndog	1	0	But why tell Jenn at all if he's guilty? Why risk her knowing and telling the police? None of it makes sense. I can't imagine why the killer would talk and tell all of these people--and I don't buy he planned to set up Adnan beginning with Jenn.	20141130T203528
Nutbrowndog	1	0	It doesn't make sense for them--if they did this together or if Jay did it alone--to not get the story straight and NOT talk at all. They are close friends unlike Jay and Adnan. It only makes sense if they are telling the truth in that they were not the killer(s) but stuck having to come clean. Obviously it's only my opinion which doesn't make it true.	20141130T203802
thebusykhaleeji	3	0	I read somewhere that one of them left the force after because there was so much dirt on him. Either way my point isn't that Adnan is in jail because they're incompetent it's actually the opposite. I'm saying they probably got the right guy but IF adnan gets an appeal it'll be because they didn't try to get more damaging evidence but instead settled for just Jay's testimony (there were fibers, different alibis to check out, searching the house, etc.) and that's where Adnan is getting his appeal.	20141130T131127

Dysbrainiac	2	0	Actually I think it makes sense to talk either way for Jay. 1- He did it and needs to make sure Jenn doesn't make a deal (or maybe he's nice enough to try to limit her role so that she doesn't get charged as an accessory, because maybe she isn't, and she a friend and been really helpful) 2- Adnan did it, but then he helped so much that he must make a deal or he might end up in prison for years. It easy to think of an eager prosecutor might claim that if he helped so much he must have been an accessory to murder, and co-conspired the whole thing. You must remember that he can't predict that the police won't find/properly search for forensic evidence. The fact that they didn't must have shocked him as much then as it does all redditors today.	20141130T210157

For me, it now always comes back to the lack of data. Even something like how often Adnan phoned Hae in the weeks before her death would be helpful. Without data, you can't dismiss speculation, can't test theories, other than by one's own standards of plausibility and likelihood.	20141130T211224

Nutbrowndog	2	0	Agreed.	20141130T211520
Dysbrainiac	1	0	But Jay know that Adnan told the detective who called the day Hae disappeared that he had put himself potentially in Haes car. He also knows Adnan is their main suspect since they got his phone log, ie they had probable cause. Anyhow, I love serial and I love discussing and pondering over details, but one has to remember that pondering ever so much doesn't result in fact and evidence. Most things that happen that day we will never know. And we must remember that a common reason for someone to do something, especially teenagers, are that they are idiots, didn't think it through, misjudged things, and therefore in hindsight makes no sense whatsoever. Hae murder itself certainly one of those things. I would love to here from Phil and Patrick though. These guys could possible really incriminate Jay, or Adnan.	20141130T215855
Nutbrowndog	1	0	"Yes. All of that. If true, if Jay framed Adnan and Adnan had nothing to do with it, (and I'm currently of the mind that it's highly unlikely) then wow. Just, wow. Yes, Patrick. Yes Phil. And according to Jay (the boy who cries wolf) he told ""Cathy"" and Jeff the night of the 13th also. Such a talker that one."	20141130T220621
mrmiffster	9	0	The fact that Jay needed a pick up at all would suggest that Jay killed Hae.

truth-seekr	3	0	"> Does Jenn have the kind of pager that accepts text messages? Her pager was most definitely numeric and did not accept text messages. Nevertheless, conveying actual messages to those pagers was possible (and quite common) in two ways. **Pager code** Kids in the 90s used pager code (number-to-letter conversion) to convey text messages in a numeric representation. E.g.: 117337 87 117811 117 15 1171175 (""meet at mall in 15 mins"") **Pager voice message** When calling the pager system, one could leave a voice message. The pager owner would then be notified and be able to listen to the message by calling a free-dial number. Here is the interactive menu that was available when you called a Skytel pager that had the VM feature plan: > ""Welcome to the Skytel system"" > ""Enter the PIN number you wish"" > ""For a numeric message, press 1 then #"" > ""For a voice message, press 2 then #"" > ""Press # to end"""	20141130T175132

blancnoise	2	0	The message was confusing but she knows exactly where the park is that Jay wanted her to pick him up? what exactly was then confusing? If Adnan is innocent and Jay and Adnan had parted ways earlier that day, (after the 6:59pm call to Yaser), and Jay had kept Adnan's cell and/or car, and Adnan had asked Jay to return the car and cell to the mosque, this meeting point would also make sense. It gives Jay two hours to do whatever between Adnan's phone call to Yaser at 6:59pm and to Nisha at 9:01pm. If this was the case, it would seem sensible for Jay to have gotten rid of any evidence e.g. shovel, before returning car to Adnan or maybe Jen was there on time, evidence was transferred from one car to the other and they drove to the dumpsters after returning phone and/or car.	20141130T074921
8shadesofgray	1	0	That seems plausible. I had thought of the benefit of the dumpsters there. But doesn't every second of delay at another stop make Adnan later for bringing food to his father (if we're accepting that he did this on a nightly basis and that not doing so might raise visibility at the mosque of his absence)? Wouldn't it be easier to just go the dumpsters directly after visiting the mosque?	20141130T072139

8shadesofgray	7	0	"Yeah, that seems equally plausible to me ... But then I am admittedly leaning toward Adnan being innocent already :) I didn't even include the full context of Jenn talking about arranging to pick up Jay, it's sooooooo convoluted: ""I was in my bedroom ah getting dress because I knew I was going out later to just hang out at my friends [redacted] house and ah I got a page and usually when I get pages or things like that I go back to my room and use the phone just 'cause that's where I feel comfortable and um that's when I got the page that was a voice message from Jay saying to get him from the park and then when I ... and then like maybe actually maybe I knew to pick him up from the park earlier I had talked to him, but I'm not sure. He left a message on the machine telling me something about either to come and pick him up at the park or he was going to be later than what he thought, so don't go to the park yet. I think I got two messages maybe on my pager ..."" ... And on and on like that. Voice messages on a pager? What?"	20141130T081655

blancnoise	3	0	Don't think you can be this definite. What size was the car park of the mosque? how busy did it get in Ramadan when typically more people attend the mosque, which would mean more cars. Seems plausible to me that Jay would park the car a couple of blocks away.	20141130T083933
readybrek	2	0	Why would they meet at the mosque? Adnan needs to get food for his Dad - wouldn't it make more sense to meet at Adnan's house?	20141130T120702
8shadesofgray	0	0	Yeah, I kind of thought the same. Although it's plausible that Adnan told Jay to use the car but not bring it straight to the mosque, either because there'd be extra traffic there for Ramadan or because his father would be upset if he had friends there, etc. But if that was the case, wouldn't he remember loaning the car to Jay that evening and giving him such explicit instructions? I don't know. The whole Jay pick-up thing is so puzzling to me. Jenn's interview in general is puzzling to me, actually.	20141130T081940
8shadesofgray	2	0	Thanks for the link. Interesting theory. I think I'm becoming more and more fixated on the evening, though ... I feel like we give scant attention to where and what people are doing from 8:00 p.m. on, when any number of activities from the storyline could be taking place without scrutiny. And I'm just struck by how much this alleged planning and abrupt changes in planning relies pretty heavily on the idea of Jenn being able to receive text pages.	20141130T073646
8shadesofgray	4	0	"I try to go real easy on her, despite my suspicious mind. It must be an absolutely terrifying experience to be a 17-year-old interviewed by police in a murder investigation. Still, while she's clearly nervous throughout, she gets near non sequitur here. I think it does kind of matter - when she's in her room, going to her room, to retrieve a voice message on her pager, but there was already a voice message on her phone, or maybe two, and now she's got a text on her pager to pick him up at the park and another that he's not ready yet"" ... When it gets that insane, it feels very much to me like she's lying. And the only possible reason I can think that she's lying is that she knows that she needs to provide a plausible explanation for why she's being paged or calling Adnan's phone in that 7:00 timeframe - and she can't give them the honest answer. This section of her interview gives me a LOT of pause."	20141130T090412
8shadesofgray	1	0	It looks like a pretty sizable parking lot from Google Maps, but I imagine it does get quite busy fro Ramadan.	20141130T084601
blancnoise	1	0	I see what you're saying, but maybe it was typical of Adnan to lend his car to Jay? I don't know, did Jay have his own car? I know that someone interviewed on the podcast that was also in track with Adnan said it was pretty normal for Jay to pick up Adnan, so that makes me think that maybe Adnan lending him his car that evening wasn't that memorable?	20141130T084303
TrillianSwan	4	0	"I do agree with you about that. I too was trying to go easy on her (I rewrote those two simple sentences several times trying to find the least accusatory way of saying it) but there are times, like this section, when she seems extremely cagey. And it makes me doubt even the parts she's ""sure"" of (are those just the times she got her story straight?). IDK..."	20141130T101401
readybrek	1	0	No worries. Actually I'm glad I found you :-) You once said somewhere that we should ignore what people say and just look at the phone records because that is nearer the truth. If you do that then the phone records alone seem to show that Jay had the phone between 7pm and 9pm. Adnan makes no calls between these times but Jenn receives a few (3 I think) and there are two unknown incoming calls - one of them is Jenn who speaks to Adnan/an unknown older male. How would you explain that?	20141130T125015
8shadesofgray	2	0	I'm in general agreement. But I generally question the role of Jay and Jenn in this whole thing ... A good 80% of the time, I believe that Jay is working to avoid a charge stronger than accessory - either as a murderer or a co-conspirator. And from that lens, Jay and Jenn would have to go beyond minimizing role to outright fabrication about Adnan's whereabouts ... And theories like blancnoise's start to seem totally plausible.	20141130T083643
8shadesofgray	3	0	"Agreed. I can see how that might be the case.

I'll have to get into a deeper dialogue with you about it at some point, play Devil's Advocate from an Adnan-might-be-innocent lens :D Related to this thread, you mention the idea of Yaser ""covering"" for Adnan. I'm interested in that in the context of the drop-off of Jay and potentially freeing up Adnan's time a little more. By ""covering"", do you mean simply being the one to bring Adnan's father food or providing a reason for his absence or what? I'm trying to think of how Adnan could possibly be this late, or not show at all, and still not raise any visibility of what sounds like a considerable crowd there, where it seems someone might be inclined to note his absence."	20141130T075251

However, psychopath seems like too strong a term.	20141130T071341

CuriousOranje	1	0	I've been going over the claim by that it would be against all odds imaginable for SK to be dealing with a sociopath in her first dealing with a criminal case; the thing is, she MUST be dealing with a sociopath. Both of them harbour the knowledge of Adnan's guilt or innocence, but alas the crux is one has maintained their lie and the lack of remorse for the murder. Therefore one must be the 'charming psychopath/sociopath', right? After swaying back and forth I am now pretty convinced of Adnan's innocence. The multiple stories exclaimed by Jay along with the prosecution's timeline being nowhere near matching a combination of them let alone just one story being the main thing that convinced me. Also there was a breakdown analysis of the cell records that I read that was pretty damning for Jay. My main problem is Jay's motive of course. But back to the Jay must be a psychopath/sociopath thing. Diving in to a morning being an armchair google-iatrist, there sure are many more personality traits (at least that we have been exposed to) that point to Jay being the 'path rather than Adnan. As the nearest to expertise that I have other than being one-google-search-removed from a Dr's Paper is my GCSE in psychology, I am just going to reel off a few things I thought flagged 'pathy without delving in to them very much : Fondness of animals - appaz some pyschopaths do have a tendency to be very close to animals Compulsive lying - a real common trait, and like stated above, many friends said Jay lied a lot. Periphery socialising and parasitic behaviour - hanger on, drug dealing and borrowing cars/phones/money, appaz matches a trait Juvenile delinquency - drug dealing, and other 'criminal elements' that we're not aware of according to Jay And purely speculative now based on the idea that Jay has murdered Hae and framed Adnan. Charming and maniuplative - Of Jen to attempt to give him the alibi and also convincing her that it was Adnan still. Of the Police, to believe his story no matter how many times it changed. Of the Jury, for them to be convinced that he had no reason to lie. Lack of empathy - To frame Adnan, to get away with the murder. Like I say, I am by no means any expert, and I guess I am now quite biased so I may be looking for things that match up. But I stand by my thoughts despite, that Jay's behaviour was more 'pathy than Adnan's (IF Jay did it of course. OBVS if Adnan has done it, his 'pathy behaviour of lying without remorse in these interviews scratch out Jay's totally).	20141206T132425

IAFG	0	0	YUP. Not to dis whoever bothered to ask Judge Heard, or to complain about having it posted here, but this is seriously the least valuable data point introduced thus far.

I've been getting buried deep in all the threads here, the maps, phone ping animations, Rabia's uploaded transcripts and blog, Woodlawner's Twitter conversations, Facebook profiles of those involved, court records etc. With a seeming lack of definitive evidence the actual and very concise opinion of the presiding Judge, (expressed then in her summary of the case and her thoughts now in the deleted post) seem to cut through all the hazy pendulum like feels I've been trying to solidify one way or the other this last week. The fact that she was the trial judge, has heard the podcasts and has such a clear and definitive opinion, has swayed me most I think. SK has to interview her now surely? I for one would love to hear her take on the case in greater depth and her explanation for her take on Adnan which seems so strong and consistent. What was your sassy comment btw?	20141130T110551
anonymous	0	0	That's because they're entitled to their opinion. A bit like you're entitled to believe it's 'fairy tales' - it's only when the person becomes convinced their opinion is a fact and tries to impose it on others or establish it as a benchmark we have a problem.	20141130T175509
Stopeatingdogs	7	0	"A judge commenting in this manner is not only unprofessional. It undermines her impartiality and adds one further critical weakness in this increasingly obvious unfair trial. Furthermore her comments suggest that she has made her own mind up a long time ago and cannot be swayed, even by the revelation of new evidence. If she was so convinced that she is happy to declare it on Facebook 15 years later, I'd suggest she might have willingly or otherwise given an unfair advantage to the prosecution. I feel like mouthing the words ""Thank you for undermining the integrity of all American judges in front of an international audience"" but she won't be able to see me. Shame."	20141130T175111

fudgeData	3	0	You're right that the message doesn't appear in response to every search for every name, but I still thing it's massively unlikely that the reason that the message comes up is that the Adnan Syed of Serial fame has asked for links to be removed in response to searches for his name. Google has clearly implemented some kind of heuristic that causes the message to appear in response to certain searches, but I wouldn't assume that it always means that the person you were searching for had links removed. (For those who are interested, here is Google's transparency report on EU privacy removals: https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/ )	20141130T124944
fudgeData	4	0	FWIW, there is no new law. The EU Court of Justice simply ruled that existing privacy/data protection law applied to Google in this case, cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Spain_v_AEPD_and_Mario_Costeja_González	20141130T120347
anonymous	2	0	It doesn't have to be him though does it? If someone else put in a removal request and that person's name came up on some pages in a search for Adnan's then it might kick in?	20141130T130841
anonymous	2	0	Well if you search 'Steve Jones' you don't get it and if you search 'Adnan Syed' you do	20141130T120030
fudgeData	3	0	My understanding is that if Person X files a request concerning an article that also mentions persons Y and Z, and Google grant that request, then that article will no longer appear in response to subsequent searches for Person X's name, but that it might still appear in results to searches for persons Y and Z, or for other searches that might bring up that article, cf https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/faq/#are_you_removing Google has a policy of informing websites when they grant a request that affects them, so if a website had published an article about the Serial case and then Google had removed links to it in response to a privacy request, then that website would have been informed, cf https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/faq/#are_you_letting_webmasters - however, Google doesn't divulge who filed the request. Even if somebody called Adnan Syed (or something similar) has had a request granted, there's no reason to assume that it's the same Adnan Syed; consider that Adnan's family is Pakistani, and there are many British Asians of Pakistani origin.	20141130T132900

RustyTrombeauxn	5	0	"> But, given the insane impact serial is starting to have on a global/massive scale now, it'll trickle down to all news stations eventually, not just the more sophisticated ones I can't find the reference right now, but I had heard Serial had something like 5-6 million downloads to date (all episodes). That's a freaking huge number for a podcast, but relative to many other forms of media it's not that large. Consider that the nightly news gets something like 8 million *per night*, and there are plenty of things that would be mentioned on one nightly news broadcast that wouldn't be mentioned on others. Podcasts are building a base right now. It's going to be great, but right at this moment I don't see mainstream media really paying that much attention. I'm not sure Serial will trickle down to mainstream news stations because SK is reporting on something old and settled. Perhaps the ""news"" is the wonderful success of the podcast, not actually Adnan."	20141130T141925

Or on* her way to school in the morning. I also do not envision the killer using the CC the same day they murder her, or ever especially locally for a petty amount. If Hae is in a rush to pick up her cousin, but decides to give Adnan a drive somewhere's, would she also go in and grab something from the store at that point if she is running late? I am not sure she would.	20141130T171355

myserialthrowaway	4	0	It's not evidence of anything. Why do people continue to focus on these tiny details that cannot possibly lead us toward the truth? Obviously, if he's innocence, then he won't feel remorse over killing Hae. But if he's only pretending to be innocent, then he won't portray any remorse over killing Hae. Because that would be ridiculous. The only situation in which remorse would be expected would be if he were acknowledging his guilt, which isn't the situation. So in this situation, a lack of remorse indicates nothing. Not psychopathy, not innocence, nothing. It's a completely reasonable way for a man claiming innocence -- innocent or not -- to act.	20141130T225500
RawbHaze	3	0	"I see ""the crime"" as being three separate crimes committed in three separate stages: 1. Kidnapping of Hae. 2. Murder of Hae. 3. Burial of Hae. Before I go on, I should say that I'm looking at this from the ""court of public opinion"" view. We have not received nearly enough of the available information for me to attempt a strict ""court of law"" opinion. I mean, we still have episodes to go to begin with and even when the season is over we won't know everything. Our biggest, by far, source of info outside of Serial is extremely biased. I'm not knocking Rabia for that- she's Adnan's advocate so it's expected. It doesn't mean her info is shit, just that it needs to be considered with her bias in mind. Unfortunately there's not a ""Pro-Hae"" advocate out there offering their own info and rebuttals to Rabia's info. Even better would be a neutral party document dump with everything as-is. No opining, no creative editing, no withholding, etc. Anyway, given the information that we have as a whole, I can not come up with a realistic scenario in which both Jay and Adnan were involved in at least one of the three crimes. Any one of the three are heinous crimes. So if Adnan ""only"" did the kidnapping that lead to the murder of Hae or ""only"" buried Hae's body... he should be showing remorse, no? Or should I say, ""YOU would EXPECT to seeeeeee remorse... WOULD YOU NOT?!?"" So I consider this when listening to his calls with SK. She's stated that they've talked for 30+ hours so we obviously haven't heard anywhere near everything he has had to say. But thus far... he hasn't given any inclination that he gives a shit about Hae. Therefore, IMO, I don't see it unreasonable to think that Adnan A.) murdered Hae and B.) did so in a more ""cold blood"" manner than a ""passionate rage"" manner. Rabia is Adnan's advocate. An innocent Adnan (who had absolutely nothing to do with the kidnapping, murder and/or burial) would be Hae's advocate. Yet he's not."	20141130T232248

Of course not.	20141130T140420
therealburndog	3	0	"Ummmm...it's more common than it should be, but to insinuate that because Adnan's parents are from Pakistan he is more likely to have murdered a woman is ridiculous. For a start, the article you linked to is about ""honour killings"". ""Some Islamic fundamentalists think that only through the murder of an offending family member can honor be restored to the rest of the family. Honor killings predominantly affect women — 943 women were killed under such circumstances in 2011 and another 869 in 2013, though not all of them were stoned. Some were just gunned down in cold blood."" For this to be an honour killing, Hae's family would have murdered her in order to 'restore the family and its honour'. This is clearly not what happened. Also, the method of murder was not consistent with an honour killing. Finally, there's no evidence that Adnan's family was in any way fundamentalist or radical."	20141130T133953
ReaderThinker	2	0	"I don't know if it is common, but it happens like everywhere else in the world. And in Pakistan, some people also believe in honor killings (killing female family members or members of social group who have brought shame on the family or group). From what I recall reading, husbands have also ""honor killed"" their wives due to infidelity, etc. I have thought about the honor killing angle in this case. Especially since he had at least one friend, Tay-- ""who was into killings and that type of stuff"" according to Jay. This ""Tay--"" person also has a criminal record (I looked it up). Who knows, he might have been influenced by such a character who made him think that HML was disrespecting him and shaming him by moving on with Don. Just speculating. However, Jay never mentions Adnan ever saying anything to that effect. Jay also has Adnan saying that ""she broke his heart"" and not that she was shaming him per se or that he was upset that she had moved with another man. So this is probably a stretch unless Adnan had some crazy beliefs that not many people were aware of at the time."	20141130T203157

Unfortunately I'm a bit pressed for time today so haven't had chance to delve into them. I do suspect when looking at murder rates for women, the difference between the US and Pakistan will be greater than the overall figure, since a lot of US murders will be gang related male-on-male incidents. On the other hand, as others have mentioned, a lot of Pakistan female victims will have been murdered in ""honour killings"", by their families, so even if statistically Pakistani men are more likely to murder women, I'm not sure that's relevant in this case. FYI I got my figures from http://chartsbin.com/view/1454"	20141130T142536

pj12341234	1	0	"A couple more data points. From the Washington post article, around 1000 women a murdered in honour killings in Pakistan each year, which with a population of 182 million, means the rate is around 0.5 per 100,000. This is lower than the murder rate of ""one women by one man"" in the US overall, which varies from 0-0.5 per 100,000 in the northern states, to 1.5 to 2 per 100,000 in the southern states. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/09/men-killing-women-domesti_n_5927140.html So.. whilst the statistics aren't perfect, they seem to show that in fact American men are more likely to kill women they're than Pakistani men, disproving OP's conjecture. Having said that, with the murder rates all fluctuating around the 0.001% mark, the numbers are so small as to be useless in predicting whether an individual is more or less likely to be guilty."	20141130T151826

therealburndog	1	0	But even if Adnan did kill Hae...it was in no way an 'honour killing'. It's nothing to do with his religion or culture. If he killed her, it was an individual issue, not because he is Muslim or Pakistani. She wasn't killed in any of the ways that would 'restore honour', and if you read closely you will see that it is usually the family of the victim who kills her, NOT the spouse or ex-spouse. Spousal murder is sadly equally common in most countries.	20141130T141353
therealburndog	1	0	But it's about controlling women in THEIR FAMILY...not other people's families. So if you think somehow Young converted to Islam and decided to murder his sister, then you're in the right track as far as 'honour killings' go. Otherwise, your theory is whack, borderline racist and shows a lack of understanding of violence against women in your own culture. Women in America are MUCH more likely to be murdered by someone close to them...much more likely. If you want to blame culture for Adnan killing Hae, you don't need to look to Pakistan, just look out the window.	20141130T143022

Edit to add: I want to say that I am thrilled that the podcast has finally gone mainstream. But public radio (NPR, APM, PRX, PRI, etc.) have all been huge supporters of podcasts. Aside from Morning Edition and All Things Considered, I don't actually l listen to any of public radio's shows except via podcast. Considering what Serial has done for WBEZ, I'm sure she will have considerable leeway with the station. S2 will be interesting. Will it flourish, or will it suffer from the sophomore slump that happens so often when the second album (or season) fails to live up to our expectations.	20141130T141857

I also think that we should take two steps back about calling podcasting's Citizen Kane moment already.

If Sarah decides to step away from serialized true crime in Season 2, I have to imagine some copycats are going to want to capitalize on the gap. This podcast's meteoric success, the demand for other serialized long-form podcasts (like StartUp) and Serial's ripple effect on increasing downloads to other crime/mystery podcasts (like Criminal and Thinking Sideways) ... It all suggests potential market demand for continued focus on long-form true crime, even if Sarah's not interested in continuing down that path.	20141130T201420

everywhere_anyhow	2	0	I don't see why there'd be rivalry between them. Audiences can help drive one another. Clearly planet money has helped Blumberg tremendously, as TAL has helped SK. So if you play your cards right, I think it's the opposite of rivalry. Podcasts are starting to get millions of listeners though, and they're not THAT expensive to produce. Gimlet already has a believable plan to make money on this stuff. I wish them well. I don't in the slightest mind shelling out money for stuff I think is awesome. I've always disliked the pledge drives because you're typically supporting a station, not a show. I want to support the show.	20141130T192040

twoCube	6	0	I think you're looking waaaay too hard into this. Currently, Serial is a spinoff of TAL, with lots of production and preproduction help by Ira Glass. I think this means, Sarah proposed the idea to Ira, he said 'great, let's do it', and has funded it directly through TAL (everyone's salary and any other costs). They found Mail Chimp and WBEZ as sponsors to help offset some of these costs. Obviously Sarah doesn't want to leech off of Ira Glass and TAL. And Ira most likely can't afford to keep Serial on board, seeing as how it's most likely a huge expense. That's why they asked for donations during episode 9. And they also announced they've received enough to fund season 2. They must have budgeted salaries, production and post production costs into all of this. Any extra money they receive will either allow them to produce better content, or deliver more content in the future. I seriously doubt Sarah and the team are making this to become filthy rich. They're doing things they are passionate, while everyone gets paid.	20141130T153411
8shadesofgray	2	0	I totally agree ... Serial Season 2 will hopefully demonstrate that it can retain current listenership and draw new listeners.

A lot of top podcasts are public radio shows, which in a sense is cannibalizing the radio model because people are less likely to donate. Podcasting is really the renaissance of radio thanks to digital delivery. TAL moving away from PRI was a step in this transition, and Serial is a bigger one IMO.

He actually says something like, ""what was it about me that made people think I was capable of doing something like this?"" It struck me as a very genuine statement. He says that he could understand them believing that he did it if there was strong physical evidence, but there wasn't any."	20141201T005334
mudmanor	1	0	You are incorrect that he called her several times on Jan 13. Please see viewfromll2.com for a list of all the calls. He did call her the night before late and gave her his # as his phone was new. She wrote the # down in a school notebook. He did not call her after she went missing because he was with people who were calling her and he was not welcome to call her house. If she had a cell I am not aware of it.	20141130T190903

It also comes out when he is convincing SK to time the prosecutions route in Ep. 5. He says ""This crime could not have been committed according to this set of facts."" He is sort of comparing it to a Dateline, so maybe the wording isn't that strange, but it stood out to me, the way he says *according to this set of facts*."	20141130T181817
Lrnshreve	13	0	"Adnan's only defense is his claim that he didn't do it. Competing with this is a witness (Jay) who says he helped him bury Hae - and who was able to bring police to Hae's abandoned vehicle. This and the fact that Adnan stopped calling her phone when she couldn't be found to me points to him being the murderer. I found Jay's response to Koenig, where he wished Adnan would 'man' up and admit to the crime, totally plausible. I find myself totally agreeing with him. But then, if Adnan did confess, well then there'd be nothing to discuss - no ""Series"""	20141130T171001
ReaderThinker	4	0	Very strange that he wouldn't page her. I think it is very out of character for a person who claimed to care about her and was a recent ex-boyfriend, as well. She was missing almost a month before her body was found and Adnan never thought to page Hae himself? Yet, he is so concerned about Stephanie getting a gift. Something is off.	20141130T184402
sjeannep	4	0	If the police called me looking for someone, I would hunt the missing person down. If the police called me looking for Hae on January 13, 1999, I would drive over to Don's looking for her. I would page her a bunch of times. Then if I figured she might have taken off to her dad's, I would call her brother, get her dad's number and call him. I would not want the cops to call me again or come to my house or whatever. The sooner I track her down, the less likely the police bother me, especially if I am a pot smoker, pot buyer and hanging around with a pot seller. The only possible reason I wouldn't follow up on every avenue that I could think of for finding Hae is if I knew where she was, and I knew she wouldn't be replying to my page, found at Don's or her father's. Adnan states he never called or paged her after he got the call from the police. He basically states he just continued assuming she either took off somewhere with Don or went to her father's until her body was found, without looking into it.	20141130T195323

lalaverne	2	0	The mysterious red gloves! Could they have been on Hae, ergo no scratches on the killer and no DNA under the fingernails. Red appears to have been a school color and Hae was going to a school-related event.	20141201T032844
Nutbrowndog	3	0	He did place two calls on Jan. 13 to Hae: http://serialpodcast.org/maps/timelines-january-13-1999 He could have paged her and not called her house. He may have, except he says in the Podcast that he probably didn't. The reasoning as to why is subjectively sound or not depending on your opinion.	20141130T193902
matsie	8	0	I'm getting more convinced of his guilt as the show progresses, but I think in this instance, it's that Adnan has spent 15 years in prison, he has gone through two trials. If he is innocent, his innocence doesn't matter. That's already been established. What he needs to do is find the weaknesses in the case because that's the *only* thing that will get him free now. Something in the case that doesn't fit OR something to exonerate him. That's all he has because (given assumption for our argument) he is innocent and that didn't save him from going to prison.	20141130T182704
Hopper80	8	0	Well, if he's read through the transcript of the interview, that detail could become lodged in his head and now comes to mind when he talks about dna stuff. It may also have been something that was brought up at the trial, and so on.	20141130T183540

Nutbrowndog	3	0	Also, as far as I can extract from the known information, her pager records were not admitted as evidence and her pager wasn't found so there is no way to prove whether he paged her or not. We are left to extrapolate.	20141130T194029

Nutbrowndog	3	0	There isn't really a right way. Anything he says is going to be taken two ways, unfortunately.

anonymous	12	0	I can't handle the use of the word fingering in this post. Moving on- you'd really have to believe the police basically fed Jay his story- including knowing where her car was (which everyone seems to agree the police didn't know). Where would that detail come from if Jay wasn't involved? Is there any indication that the police were so desperate they would frame adnan for no apparent reason? I'm all for being skeptical of police work but I'm having trouble imagining that narrative. I would love to hear from someone who can give me a counter argument.	20141130T161252
mostpeoplearedjs	2	0	Jay has enough knowledge (car location, burial scene, clothing, manner of death) that he's involved in the burial. A third party would point to the scenario where Jay helps the third party but implicates Adnan to protect this third person. Jay would have criminal exposure in the event the above came to light and should initially remain silent in that scenario.	20141130T172737
Superben14	1	0	"The only plausible 3rd person story that I can think of is this: someone Jay feels responsible for (like a younger cousin or something) calls him and says ""I fucked up and killed a girl, help me"". It explains Jay being willing to help bury the body, it explains his desire to clean the fingerprints from the shovels, and it explains why he lied about the location of the murder (the story about not wanting to say it was at best buy because he was worried that there were cameras - which makes no sense - since the cameras would only help his story). But any 3rd party story just seems ridiculously far-fetched. Unless of course that person was a friend of Nisha, had a beef with Hae, and was close enough to both Jenn and Jay that they would want to help him."	20141130T162946
8shadesofgray	1	0	I lean toward Adnan's innocence, but there are also scenarios where a third person's DNA is found and Jay and Adnan are still involved parties, particularly if it was a third party that either or both of them associated with. Less likely but still possible.	20141130T200443
happydee	1	0	ohhh great question. I don't think the DNA will come back identifying a different killer. But great hypothetical!	20141130T203039
lavacake23	1	0	The DNA could come back belonging to someone else and it doesn't necessarily clear Adnan. She and Don could have had sex the night before and it could end up being from that. Perhaps, that's why the police didn't test the materials, because they thought it would end up belonging to Don, who, they thought, couldn't have done the murder because he had an airtight alibi.	20141130T203216
godlessgam3r	1	0	In my opinion Jay knows too much to not be involved to some degree. How does Jay know all of these things if he is not some way involved in the crime: -where the car was -Method of death -location of body -Clothes she was wearing -The activator that was knocked off in the car -Hae's possessions being disposed off -depth of the grave edit: Sorry, I realized I didn't really address what this would mean for Jay's involvement if Adnan is not involved in any way. Looking at the options you have provided, Jay couldn't have made up all of this correct information in order to frame Adnan IMO so I think we can toss 1 out. There is also way too much correct info for the cops to feed Jay, I don't feel they would be in desperation mode at this point of the investigation to feed Jay all of this. So I think we can toss out number 2. So that leaves 3 or 4. I do not think there is enough to say either way if he was the killer or if his involvement is what he says it was just with another person in stead of Adnan.	20141130T161220
ChariBari	1	0	Personally, I will probably come to the conclusion that Jay was not involved if it turns out a serial killer killed Hae unless there is some demonstrated connection between Jay and the killer. I find it more plausible that Jay's entire knowledge of the crime was a lie than that Jay colluded with a serial killer to murder this girl and managed to frame Adnan for it. I know many will disagree.	20141130T162048
8shadesofgray	1	0	"Let me preface by saying that I think it's increasingly unlikely that Jay was fed all the details he knew ... There are just so many of them! That being said, I do think it's possible, if not probable. We know Jenn had obtained non-public details about the case, per her interview. I can imagine a scenario where Jay has advanced knowledge of two or three non-public details in his pre-interview - enough for the cops to believe his story and to be more candid about other details of the crime. Even in this scenario, though, they can't feed details they don't know. Which brings us back to foreknowledge about the location of the car. Is it reasonable to believe that the police actually did know the car's whereabouts and let Jay ""discover"" the location for them? I think it's highly unlikely and still points to Jay being involved."	20141130T200118

soamx	1	0	I waffle back and forth between Adnan being guilty & innocent. For me If he's innocent, he's telling the truth- he went to class that day, he went to track, he went to mosque, he hung out with Jay. he doesn't know anything of Hae's murder and Jay carried these acts out and pinned the blame on him because police started catching a scent of his trail. If he's guilty, Jay was an accessory to the murder. At the bare minimum He knew it was coming, he agreed to be Adnan's alibi and help him bury the body. There's no way to explain away all the lies and inconsistencies that Jay has in his multiple stories unless he was trying to hide significant crimes on his part. Some days I feel Adnan is guilty and some days I feel he's innocent. Every day I feel Jay is guilty.	20141201T151533
EvilSockMonkey	2	0	I don't follow your logic here. Why would Jay having done time, make it less likely that Rabbia and the Syed family believe that Adnan did it? It seems likely that they still would have contacted SK and all of the other facts would remain the same.	20141201T141721
EvilSockMonkey	0	0	I'm sorry, I must be especially dense this morning, but Jay was charged and pled guilty to being an accessory after the fact. He was given a suspended sentence of 5 years and two years probation. His testimony did not help him to avoid being charged, it was in fact a confession to a crime.	20141201T144109
EvilSockMonkey	1	0	Could you perhaps be confusing accessory with accomplice. Jay was charged with and plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact, so I really don't understand you Edit statement. Jay did not avoid being charged with being an accomplice.	20141201T172950
EvilSockMonkey	1	0	Any attorneys on this thread, please correct me if I am wrong. Accessory is aiding and abetting before, or after the crime itself (among other things). An accomplice would be one who aids in the commission of the crime itself. My point is that Jay was charged with and plead guilty to being an Accessory after the fact. He knew that the crime was committed, did not alert the authorities and aided in disposal of the body and the car. Is your point that he could have been charged with accessory before the fact, possibly as an accomplice and that he escaped those charges as a result of the testimony he gave?	20141201T180805

ludoc	18	0	"1) It has been repeatedly argued that it occurred many times (specifically to Jay) 2) yes but it does not prove anything. 3) Nisha's recollection about the porn shop makes it plausible that Nisha remembered another call. There are theories of butt dial or Jay's intentional call http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2nt9s7/a_potential_theory_for_the_nisha_call/ Maybe they are less likely but it is not impossible. 4) the phone was probably there (with some margin of error in cell tower data), but no evidence that he was there. Actually all calls during that period were to Jenn, who is Jay's friend, not Adnan's. See http://viewfromll2.com/2014/11/23/serial-a-comparison-of-adnans-cell-phone-records-and-the-witness-statements-provided-by-adnan-jay-jenn-and-cathy/ for an alternative explanation. 5) the call the night before had clear purpose — letting her his new cell number. It seems like most people thought that it was nothing serious and I think it's not impossible that he didn't call. (also remember that it's either to home landline or her pager. not sure about the pager logs) 6) And the note was written *before* they get back together. Also it was a note passed during a class. Again I think it cannot be a critical evidence. It was ""I am going to kill"" btw. 7) I think 'following the ""respectable"" attorney's advice' is a reasonable way to go about it for a panicked teenager. > ""8) the lack of any physical evidence in Hae's car tied to Jay.""

It didn't take much convincing to present our minority's reasonable doubt arguments in the jury room and turn it 11-1. The one lady who was unconvinced simply went along with everyone else to get back to her job. I'm kind of shocked that this jury gave a quick verdict after so much time at trial.

pennyparade	2	0	Yes, it's the most likely scenario. I approached this case looking for a way to exonerate Adnan; I think that has been SK's approach as well.

Phoenixrising007	1	0	3) Has anyone considered it possible that Jay made the call to Nisha on purpose (or possibly on accident)? If nisha's record is to be believed as happening on Jan 13, she says that adnan handed it to Jay......maybe she's assuming adnan handed it to Jay because it's adnan's cell and she'd assume adnan is with his cell. I mean if Jay is guilt, that means he's going to an awful lot of work to frame adnan. What better way to obscure the fact that all the leakin park calls were to Jen than throw in a call to nisha. I know this could work both ways but still.	20141130T192913
magellan125	1	0	Agreed - whoever killed Hae had to somehow get invited into her car at her point of origin, the high school. A carjacking would have gotten some public notice and left physical evidence. She had told numerous people she was going from point A to B, but someone convinced her to slightly derail her plans by begging for a ride. It was someone she knew well and was willing to give a ride to... All roads lead back to Adan.	20141205T030009

I disagree with everything you've said, but #6 has stuck out to me, because many people have brought this up and it's not a matter of opinion: Unhealthy and abusive relationships are marked by these on and off again statuses. It's been documented that it takes women more tries to leave an abusive relationship than a healthy relationship. So, the fact that they got back together (while it doesn't prove an unhealthy relationship) certainly doesn't disprove the content of the letter.	20141130T171700

Adnan, if innocent, would have had no way of knowing this was an important detail in the case and wouldn't have attached any significance to it. 6 weeks is a long time and it is understandable that you would misremember a small detail after that much time has passed.

anonymous	5	0	A violent act could potentially leave evidence. The Hair found didn't match Jay. I don't think the blood stain did either, and non of the finger prints in the car matched him. Does it prove he wasn't he wasn't in the car? No. However it is the location where most of the physical evidence would be located. it has no link to Jay. This provide credence to his testimony that he was never in the car. If Jay wasn't in the car, then who was?	20141130T182359
Nutbrowndog	3	0	I agree with your scenario and lack of evidence isn't proof. The problem for some of us it the preponderance of the facts listed above. Yes any one of them can have a hole punched in it but taken as a whole they paint a very concerning narrative coupled with the fact that the accused can't remember and there's even more than that that's troubling about Adnan. Is it enough to convict? I'm not sure. The Asia letters should have come in. Had they there most likely would have been reasonable doubt. But maybe not. Maybe if the prosecutor knew they'd be evidence they would have had to adjust their time line. Their theory didn't make a lot of sense. But when everyone is lying the prosecution and police, in trying to gain justice for the murder victim, have to make decisions on what they can reasonably believe happened.	20141130T180635
pennyparade	0	0	Can you explain this further? Are you suggesting Jay was not involved? That his confession was coerced and false? If you believe Jay was involved, the fact that no physical evidence places Jay in Hae's car suggests he Jay had help committing this crime, right?	20141130T175911

What I am saying is that the fact that they got back together after Hae wrote Adnan that note does not *negate* the content of the note - the content being that Hae felt Adnan was having difficulty accepting the break-up; content which was used to illustrate that Adnan had an unhealthy relationship towards Hae: that he was 'hung-up' on her. I'm not speaking to the validity of the original evidence, just saying that the fact that they got back together does not negate the original argument the prosecution made, because if he truly were an obsessed ex-boyfriend unable to move on, that could increase the likelihood that they would date again, not decrease it.	20141130T194801

I think it's unlikely but it's possible Jay did that. Same goes for shoddy forensics. I haven't heard anything about the forensics being shoddy (lacking in quantity, yes) but it's possible too. But a lack of physical evidence in Hae's car linking to Jay *does* have significance then, if only to introduce the above theories of Jay cleaning the scene or the forensics being shoddy. And the other scenario, the one I was getting at, is that the lack of physical evidence linking Jay to the car can also be read as a significant bolstering of the theory that he had an accomplice.	20141130T191454

However, I find it extremely convincing that the first glance for the Innocence Project showed so many gigantic holes. My view of innocence and guilt would only be shaped by their conclusions, not by an entertaining podcast.

dixjours	170	0	I'll say something here that many lawyers are often hesitant to. I rely on the anonymity of reddit to say it. State court judges are often not, shall we say, the best and the brightest among us in the legal profession. I live in a state which actually has a very fine state court judiciary, and even then we grimace when we get stuck with a case in state court, as opposed to federal court. The minority of state court judges who are superb jurists are often plucked away to become appellate judges, or federal judges. I have no comment on Judge Heard specifically. I'm sure she is a hard-working and fine trial judge. But I do caution against putting any weight whatsoever on her opinion here, because (1) every trial judge in America believes that he or she ruled correctly in any given trial, and (2) she has no special insight into the evidence against Syed that we are unaware of, contrary to the impression she apparently leaves with some redditors. And one final point, in her defense actually. The most critical issue in this case, in my view, is Gutierrez's failure to investigate the Asia Mclane letters. This is an issue on which Judge Heard had zero information during the trial. I find it strange that she would make such an annoyingly opinionated comment given that she's supposedly listened to the podcast now. But the Gutierrez-Mclane issue has nothing whatsoever to do with this judge, because its true facts were not fully uncovered until the podcast aired.	20141130T172531

The states case against the person on trial was pretty weak and the city police really messed up the evidence. It was an interesting yet stressful thing to be on that jury.

We have heard from the judge now and several jury members and we know they only met for two hours. The prosecution presented a strong case.

shapshapboetie	29	0	I hear you. The judge in this case was appointed around the time of the murder. Literally, it was less than a week before Hae's body was found. She ran for election (uncontested) in March 2000, which was after the re-trial but before the sentencing. She is up for re-election in 2015. [Her background](http://judgepedia.org/Wanda_Keyes_Heard) is such that she did not have a lot of recent trial experience IMO, as she had some admin/ exec roles too. And some were in a US territory (same as federal laws), not in Maryland. And this closely-watched case was one of her first trials. Appointed judge. Later to be an elected judge. Without much experience. High profile case. First degree murder case. I'm guessing your state doesn't have elected judges? There are [several states that do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retention_election#Usage): including Maryland & Pennsylvania but mostly southern and western states, including California. Turnout in judicial elections is shit. The voters know about as much as the Syed jury. And the judges are sometimes appointed to placate donors, interests groups, or other political factions.	20141130T175026

Jellysleuth	-1	0	"If Baltimore has a haunted courtroom, that presents an intriguing whodunit. Judge Heard suspects it's the spirit of Roger B. Taney, the 19th-century U.S. Supreme Court chief justice whose name is inscribed on the dome. (Taney never presided in that courtroom, having died decades before the courthouse was completed in 1900. But he lived across the street, in a now-demolished house on East Lexington, said U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James F. Schneider, who is the Mitchell Courthouse historian and who takes no position on ghosts.) Taney wrote the pro-slavery Dred Scott decision. That gives the departed justice motive if not obvious means or opportunity. **""He might have a little bit of a problem with me presiding,"" said Heard, noting that her ancestors were slaves.** from : http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-03-23/news/0803230021_1_taney-ghosts-courtroom ------------------------------------------------------------------ I always thought a Judge was supposed to be impartial, no matter their background."	20141130T180056

joppy77	5	0	I might not have seen all of the judge's comments about Adnan, but my memory of the gist of it was that he used his intelligence to fool and manipulate the people around him, carry out the murder, and hide his guilt. To me, there is nothing about that that is inconsistent with being 17. A lot of teenagers are intelligent and keen manipulators, especially if they're high-functioning sociopaths. I'm not saying Adnan is a sociopath (since we can't know that anymore than we can know if he murdered Hae)... I'm just presenting an example of how a teen could fit that description. It's not the norm, but then neither is murder. I knew someone in high school who had almost everyone absolutely fooled with a likable, smart, accomplished persona he presented to the world, and a remorseless, disturbing personality underneath... he carried out a variety of malignant acts and manipulations and relied on the false persona to remain unsuspected, even from most of his close friends. Adnan's demeanor actually reminds me of this guy in a lot of ways, which is why I've been inescapably biased against Adnan since I first heard him, even though I assumed the podcast would hinge on the realization that he actually wasn't guilty. Anyway, if the judge said further things about Adnan that went beyond what I said above, then obviously I need to go find it. edit: fixed words	20141130T231550

C-JaneJohns	10	0	">Because what we know so far is kind of more like underwhelming. The frightening part about that is when in Ep. 8 the retired detective (is he a private investigator now, or just someone who goes back through files?) states that it has more evidence than *most* cases usually do. There are moments when I feel shaken by our legal system (reading To Kill a Mockingbord was probably my first moment) and this was definitely one of those moments. For the top part of your question, I think SK would, at the very least, disclose something about sealed/confidential proceedings. There isn't anything too mysterious about confidential records in a case like this, especially considering""C/Kathy"", Aisha, Jay, all of Hae Lee's family, and others have expressed concerns about their exposure to a criminal/the public. So this statement by the judge seems both overly sure of herself and condescending to me."	20141130T172650

UrnotRyan	0	0	I only remember hearing from one juror on the podcast... Am I mistaken or did another juror come forward somewhere else? Also, I found it interesting that the juror on the podcast based her opinion in part on 1) not hearing testimony from Adnan (despite the standard instruction not to hold that against a defendant) and 2) the assumption that the star witness had nothing to gain because he would be facing jail time as well (which we know to be false). This was just one juror, but I'd be curious to hear your opinion. Was this reflective of the prosecution misleading the jury, bad presentation by the defense, a misunderstanding by this particular individual, or indicative of a fault in the judicial process?	20141201T062427

The result of that is that once they are on the bench they don't know the law or rules of evidence that apply in family cases. What is worse, they often are not willing to learn the law that applies, even though they are doing things like deciding the direction of children's lives or the fate of domestic violence victims. I hear from friends that it is often the same way with many criminal judges.	20141130T191702

YoungFlyMista	1	0	No. It's casting serious doubts on her recollection of the day years after the fact. But even still what she remembers about the day is legit even if her wording is inaccurate. She said that she remembers the day because of the snow. When she got more specific about what she remembered about the snow specifically, she remembered that she was snowed in at her boyfriend's place. So what she remembers about the snow is being forced to stay with her boyfriend who she was mad at for being late. The meeting with Adnan preceded that. She never said at what time it was snowing. But if she was snowed in at her boyfriends which happened after she saw Adnan at the library then that falls right in line with the weather report that said the ice storm happened later. Ice storm = snow storm. That's an easy mistake almost a decade later. Regardless. Her recollection of the day after a decade later has nothing to do with those letters. The day would have been much fresher in her mind weeks after. Asia's letters and her recollection of the day are legit and the reason why this case has been solved since episode 1. Adnan didn't do it. He was at the library. Asia is his alibi. Free Adnan.	20141201T024940

anonymous	2	0	it really could go either way. I don't know what they have uncovered. It could be Jay and Jens secret romance to another eyewitness??? I'm not sure what, but I think half of this subreddit will be shocked! It will be interesting:)	20141130T194843
C-JaneJohns	8	0	Yeah I've wondered about this myself. SK does a fantastic job doing what are essentially evidence summaries for a defense. However if the jury was paying attention (like they should), the judge was paying attention (like she/he should), and the prosecutor was smart enough to summarize complicated evidence to his/her favor, then it could really go the state's way. How you present evidence is *everything* in court (or a Podcast!) and can really persuade people one way or another. Edit: I should state that I think SK is a little enamored of Adnan, but far more enamored of his case. So I firmly believe that she is presenting evidence in a pretty unbias way, but the cell phone data might be an exception.	20141130T173429
anonymous	3	0	eh I think that's unfair. Koenig tl;dr'd the cell phone testimony for us, but she did present it as compelling evidence. THe podcast even elevated Dana to the position of expert when she said that the cell phone was in the park when Jay said the body was being buried.	20141130T224614

totallytopanga	2	0	I have learned so much from this! I had never thought about how little resources are available for preparing for these things. Also, I am kind of embarassed I never just assumed this but - how cops don't just present all the evident they find without bias to both sets of attorneys to look at and go with whatever they need to go with. I just always assumed the cops job was primarily to find evidence (in a fair and unbias way), not primarily to find evidence for the prosecution. I am realizing that if you are ever charged with a crime you did not commit it would be impossible to prove it unless you are very lucky or have alot of money.	20141204T181711

amalechimp	11	0	That's a good point. I think a lot of people want to be cautious about believing Adnan is guilty because they think this could be a case of someone lying and someone else being locked up purely based on that. They're thinking it could happen to anyone and they'd like to be given the benefit of the doubt if it was them. But no one seems too bothered about Jay being falsely accused and dealing with the consequences of that. I suppose that's because at least he's not in prison, and also because we know for a fact that he lied and that he at the very least helped to bury a body and cover up a murder and people can't put themselves in his shoes. No one thinks they could ever be in Jay's situation so they aren't as bothered about what happens to him.	20141130T180621
sososerial	4	0	I am still undecided as to whether or not Adnan is guilty, but I will say this; Jay perhaps should've thought about his life being potentially ruined when he agreed to be a murder accomplice. I won't feel sorry for Jay one single moment, because (according to his story) he had an opportunity to prevent the death of Hae Min Lee and he chose not to.	20141130T201915
anonymous	2	0	"I'm following because the only way I can arrive at a verdict is by making untestable assumptions about what is plausible and what isn't plausible.

fuchsialt	2	0	I agree that all of the Jay finger pointing is pretty scary but to say this is all because of something Adnan did...well, Jay has no one else to blame for getting involved in a murder than himself. According to his own story, he had opportunity to do something. If it all went down like he says, than of course I can see how fear could have gotten the better of him but I still can't accept that as an excuse for the things he did and kept secret until being called upon by police 6 weeks later. This story is worth studying for a multitude of reasons other than simply questioning who's really guilty. We all know that this a story being told from one person's perspective of limited investigation. I think the listener has to be responsible in weighing the information given while being aware of that and I appreciate that there are people/orgs willing to create things without over editing or censoring themselves to oblivion out of fear of what the public reaction might be. This is a fine line to walk, sure, but Jay's own actions and decisions are what made him a vulnerable target for scrutiny, not Adnan or SK. I would hope listeners (on an individual or larger media scale) would hold themselves accountable if they make any negative declarations or actions upon anyone involved in the show. When SK tells us she thinks Jay may be lying and Adnan might be innocent, that doesn't give anyone free license to publicly harass Jay and any person committing these actions should be alone held responsible for any damages caused.	20141130T203351

There were quite a few judges who got shuffled around then with lifelong civil judges switching to criminal or vice versa.

partymuffell	0	0	I'm neither an appellate judge nor a lawyer but it's my understanding that appeals are not retrials, so the appellate judge does not need to look at all of the evidence against the appellant in order to make his/her decision. They only need to look at the specific evidence that is relevant to the appeal. If so, it's not clear to me that reading the appellate briefs (and, in fact, only those from Adnan's side) is sufficient to form a clear and definitive opinion on what went on during trial and in particular on the strength of the case against the appellant. Maybe I'm missing something? Also, it seems to me that to determine whether Gutierrez failed to represent Adnan appropriately, we would need to look not only at the trial's transcript but also we would need to know what she knew about the case, much of which, it is my understanding, is covered by attorney-client privilege and, as such, is practically unknowable, especially considering Gutierrez passed away.	20141201T055331

If you have read the various evidence docs, the appelate docs, and analyzed the maps and cell tower data, and reflected on why Adnan did what he did for certain that day, and what he didn't do subsequently, you will come to see it as the jury did. Just because Jay is more guilty than he let on doesn't make Adnan innocent.	20141201T013057

He tells us of how it doesn’t have any beak to defend itself like a bird, no claws like a lion, nor teeth like an alligator. But it does have what could be called an ink bag, and to protect itself when it is attacked it lets out a dark fluid from this bag, thus making all of the surrounding water dark and murky, enabling the octopus to escape into the darkness. “Now I ask you folks, is there any similarity between that description of the ink bag of the octopus and the defense in this case? Has the defense shown you any real, valid, legitimate defense reasonably based on the evidence, or has it sought to employ the ink bag of the octopus, and by making everything dark around Mr. Syed, tried to let him escape into the darkness. “I intend to clear up the water which defense counsel have sought to muddy, so that you folks can clearly see the evidence, the facts, the issues in this case, so that you can behold the form of the retreating octopus and bring this defendant back to face justice.” Now, that’s a compelling analogy that can be modified slightly to fit a situation where the other side has set out to confuse and confound.

The detectives in this case were cautious and methodical. They weren’t rushing to grab suspects or to dismiss them either. The evidence collection was well documented. I didn’t expect to hear that even though its basically a one witness case, the cell records mostly don’t match Jay’s statements, there’s no physical evidence linking Adnan to the murder. Despite all that, to an experienced detective like Trainum, this looks like a pretty sound investigation. **Jim Trainum** I would said that this is better than average.	20141130T175329

And apart from Jay, this is cruel to do to Hae's family. Now, I am of the opinion that Adnan did it. I truly believe a murderer is behind bars. So, that colors my opinion, obviously. ETA: Just wanted to add, too, that a whole lot of people are up-in-arms over the police work done. How it was shoody, possibly conspiratorial. Basically, folks think the police were unfair to Adnan. Yet, people won't accept that many, many, MANY police officers DO have a bias against black men, which is why a lot of black men don't freely go to the police about anything (like Jay). Again, I am not saying he's a saint.....but, there's also a significant amount of double standard wafting through these forums.	20141130T205242

I can remember, in technocolor, the day my mom died -- 9 years ago. I can remember, again, vividly, the day one of my friends died -- nearly 20 years ago. The initial set-up SK did with the ""remember, everybody's memory sucks"" was disingenuous and set an unbalanced tone from the jump. And think about it: for a lot of people on this subreddit, ""oh, memories are skint"" is only applied to excuse Adnan of things -- never Jay. Every ""can't remember"" or ""change of story"" of Jay's is treated like it's the major lie that should blow the case wide open. Adnan changed his story, too, throughout the course of all this, if I remember correctly. I know it sounds like I am defending Jay, I'm not. I just think the double standards have gotten out of hand when evaluating the two guys. There is just as much ""evidence"" against Adnan as there is Jay, but people think Jay should be thrown in jail, and Adnan released. In any event, bottom line: I'm extremely uncomfortable with how this whole serial podcast has played out and the carelessness with which SK and crew have crafted certain perceptions."	20141130T233611

We are receiving this story from the perspective of SK, of course, but she has been investigating this for about a year now. Granted, an investigation into a crime from 15 years ago has inherent limitations, but this is vastly more time than a defense lawyer, detective, or judge is able to dedicate to any single case.

EvilSockMonkey	5	0	I agree that there had been a snow earlier in the month. In this part of the northeast, it's fairly common to refer to any winter weather that restricts folks movement as being snowed in- whether caused by actual snow, freezing rain or an ice storm. From southern Pennsylvaina, through Maryland and into Northern Virginia, it is not uncommon for schools to close in anticipation of forecast weather events. Snowed-in can mean nothing more than a travel advisory. I have no problem at all with Asia's letters in that context. They were calling for a winter storm, the school was closed, therefore she was snowed in.	20141130T232323
readybrek	1	0	What's really weird though is that I'm sure I read something from Aisha that kind of confirms Asia's idea of the weather being really bad.

I'd like to see such a meteorologist try. And once I'm done shredding that metereologist to shreds, I'd like to see the prosecutor try to beat up on Asia McLain for being a liar, when she appears to be a perfectly credible and disinterested witness whose facts are supported by her then-boyfriend. But of course, we didn't have the chance to pursue any of those angles or fight any of those battles in court, because Gutierrez failed to even call McLain on the telephone.	20141130T215908

C-JaneJohns	2	0	I think that several points you have raised are right (especially about bias confirmation, which is practically confirmed in episode 8), but I am currently feeling that Adnan did it. What I think is really wrong with the case, and someone just posted something about this yesterday, is Jay's timeline. This might be because he was high at the time. I have friends who can both perfectly recount what they were doing while high, and others who could tell you what they did but have *no* idea when it happened or where. However Jay's timeline is a mess, and that makes this case seem very unstable against Adnan. Like I said above I think SK is not letting whatever her feelings are cloud her reports on this information. However the cell phone records are one of the bigger things that she does kind of condense for better story telling (and probably rightly so) but while doing so it makes them seem (maybe) a little less concrete than they actually are.	20141130T193651
amalechimp	5	0	I think it's partly because we're hearing conversations with Adnan and he comes across as a fairly reasonable person. The same thing probably went in Jay's favour during the trial. I do think people are putting too much importance on the fact that Jay's story changed. I'd expect someone to misremember the order things happened in and mis-estimate the times. Wouldn't a totally made up story be a bit more consistent? The big problem is the changing claims about where things happened. I don't know what the explanation of that would be. It doesn't make me completely dismiss his overall story, though.	20141130T191128
confuego14	2	0	I get you on the significant day\memory point, I remember everything about the day my mom died too (24 years ago) But it's not as significant for Adnan (if innocent) the day his ex didn't pick up her cousin.	20141201T043739
UrnotRyan	2	0	I'm actually going to take you up on your second question and I hope you find it helpful: It is not a double standard to believe memory lapses in the case of Adnan but to have major issues with Jays recollections, due to the same reasoning you state. To Adnan, this was a completely normal, typical day. He didn't hear anything about Hae until late in the evening (even he was way high). Even then, it was asking about the whereabouts of his friend. No one was informing him she was dead. Even her other friends thought she must have taken off to California or something. Nothing like the traumatic events you are comparing it to from your own experience. On the other hand, the events Jay describes are exactly the shocking, traumatic events you would expect to create the vivid, stuck in your head memories. This also brings up another issue: Jay doesn't just say he can't remember details. He completely changes critical aspects of his story. I believe after his first taped interview he even drove with the cops to point out the exact location he claimed Adnan showed him body! The next time he tells his story this changes to an entirely different locale, of course. Adnan, on the other hand, is forced to account for his time with generalities and probabilities because it was an unremarkable day. You seem to be blessed with a very acute memory, but I'm sure you know that many people are not. Empathizing with someone having difficulty remembering the minutiae of a random Wednesday 6 weeks prior and faulting another party for being wildly inconsistent about very big details of the day he was an accessory to murder and helped bury a body are two completely different things.	20141201T055251

I should add that I do not necessarily deny that a good lawyer might have got Adnan acquitted.However, that doesn't make him innocent.

[again read Gutierrez-style] To my mind, this behaviour is consistent with Asia having no relevant knowledge of the facts, wanting to help her friend to the point of possibly lying, and then moving on in life and not wanting to have anything to do with any of this (let along wanting to perjure herself on the stand).	20141201T055746

Consider the cell tower map and calls made http://i.imgur.com/izCczOe.jpg -- A points North, B to some place South, C to West/NW. Remember, this is 1999, in a Baltimore suburb. It's _not_ Manhattan (where there is lots of cell traffic, tall buildings, obstructions). Cell phones normally connect to the nearest tower to reduce power. Today, with everyone with a cell phone, load balancing is more of an issue than it was then. 2. Syed bought the cell phone a day or two before Jan 13, 1999. It was activated on Jan 12. 3. Syed leaves his phone and car with Jay, a guy who takes the detectives to Hae's car. He calls Jay the night before, the morning of the 13th, hangs out with Jay at Cathy's in the early evening, has a blunt or more with him, etc. Jay, however, is not someone he is ""kicking it with per se"" 4. Syed asks Hae for a ride, saying his car is in the shop, even though he has given it to Jay. Two people heard him, and he admitted as much to Officer Adcock on the 13th. Later, he denies asking for a ride with a different police officer. 5. Syed doesn't say his phone was not with him after he is seen with Jay at Cathy's. However, his phone pings Leakin Park tower at 7pm-8pm. Then, it pings the tower that is consistent with where Hae's car was found. Jay admits to burying Hae with Syed during this time. Jay is calling/paging Jenn from Syed's cell phone, but Syed says he is in the mosque at that time, and the phone is with him (Syed). 6. Syed never looks for Hae after she goes missing. There is no evidence that he called Don either. Just the day prior, he was calling Hae three times at midnight+ 7. After Jay pins it on Syed, Syed never says Jay is lying. The only explanation is if he points a finger at Jay, he would have 3 pointing back at himself. 8. Syed writes something about wanting to kill Hae on a note that Hae had written him. Look forward to your response. I'm evaluating all of the above using Bugliosi's rope analogy that goes like this: “I think that counsels’ problem is that they misconceive what circumstantial evidence is all about. Circumstantial evidence is not, as they claim, like a chain. You could have a chain spanning the Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia to Bordeaux, France, consisting of millions of links, and with one weak link that chain is broken. “Circumstantial evidence to the contrary, is like a rope. And each fact is a strand of that rope. And as the prosecution piles one fact upon another we add strands and we add strength to that rope. If one strand breaks – and I’m not conceding for one moment that any strand has broken in this case – but if one strand does break, the rope is not broken. The strength of the rope is barely diminished. Why? Because there are so many other strands of almost steel-like strength that the rope is still more than strong enough to bind these two defendants to justice. That’s what circumstantial evidence is all about.” EDIT: fixed reddit's formatting and some minor typos."	20141201T042057

latoya77	1	0	See, I don't buy that. It did turn out to be a significant day. Because when he was fingered as a suspect, six weeks isn't that long that he couldn't piece together any memory or credible alibi.

latoya77	1	0	"Still, not buying it. Let's, for example, take the ""pay phone"" issue. People are going apoplectic that Jay said there was a pay phone at best buy outside. ""The fact that there wasn't a cell phone at best buy proves Jay is the lone killer!"" (basically, paraphrasing). Even SK went out of her way to make a big deal of that. Well, turns out there were pay phones at best buy, they just happened to be inside not outside. Now, if this were an Adnan ""mistake"", it would be chalked up to ""oh, bad memory. maybe they were inside instead of out. no biggie."" And it would be discounted. But with Jay, the prevailing attitude amongst pro-Adnan"" folks is, ""the fact that the phone was inside instead of out is the crux of the case and implicates Jay as the only murderer."" And I don't buy that the whole case hinges on the pay phone being outside. No way. Adnan simply could have used the pay phones inside of best buy and then walked outside. He could have been standing near an electricity box or some other structure that resembled a pay phone, but the pay phone actually used was inside.

You really believe he never said that to his lawyers or friends as shit went down? And he also says it pretty clearly when he says ""I thought maybe he was trying to collect the reward money"" or otherwise just got caught up when the cops started asking questions. He just doesn't say it directly enough to satisfy you when the recorder is running with SK.

anonymous	4	0	I feel uncomfortable playing this card but I think it's relevant here. I am a cognitive neuroscientist and my background is primarily in studying emotional memory in humans -- that is, memories that are better remembered because they were strongly emotional. I would consider myself an expert on this topic. Based on my experience in/knowledge of memory, Adnan's memory seems entirely consistent with an innocent person's. He clearly remembers things that are specifically tied to that day -- it was Stephanie's birthday, so he remembers giving her a gift, what gift he gave her, when he gave it to her, what her reaction was, etc. But other things that weren't specifically tied to January 13 were foggier. If nothing of significance happened to him between school letting out and track practice beginning, then it seems entirely plausible that he would have no specific memory of that time -- in fact, that is the MOST plausible story, to me, coming from an innocent person. Regarding Jay's story, he didn't report memory *loss* -- he reported wildly changing memories. I have given a similar example before, so please forgive me for repeating myself. There is a big difference between memory loss, and changing stories. Eg: **Memory loss:** I can't remember what I did last Wednesday after work. I probably would have picked up my daughter from daycare and then come home and started dinner, but I don't remember what I made, when I got home, etc. (This, to me, represents a normal pattern of memory.) **Changing stories:** Last Wednesday, I came home from work and made tortellini. Last Wednesday, I left work a little early and my husband made dinner. Last Wednesday, I had to stay late at work so my husband picked up our daughter, and together we made steak and salad. (This, to me, does not in any way reflect a normal pattern of memory.) Finally, I will add that if you genuinely can remember all your activities from October 10 without any kind of cues (e.g., looking at texts from that day, or at a diary you keep, or similar) then your memory is truly unusual, and you may have something called [Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia).	20141201T042518

The only evidence we have to believe Gutierrez didn't contact Asia (thereby allegedly violating Adnan's 6th Amendment rights) is Asia's word and even you must admit that Asia lied (on your version of events she lied when she told the prosecutor that she was pressured into signing that affidavit). So, why is it such a stretch to believe that, as the appellate judge implies, she lied initially in her letters and she lied subsequently about not being contacted by Gutierrez to cover her previous lie?

(Even if her story about the PI were true, why would she have to call the prosecutor and say she was pressured to sign the affidavit?) Anyway, this is a moot question---if Asia had taken the stand, any half decent prosecutor would have ripped her testimony to shreds.	20141201T140853

latoya77	1	0	"But, Adnan changed his story, too. Moreover, Adnan seems to be ""slipping"" in ""casual"" conversations with SK -- like with the phonebooth thing. But when these slips happen, people just poo-poo them. ""Oh, it doesn't mean anything..."" But with Jay, totally different story. Perhaps I am not being clear enough with my point, but basically, what I am saying is that people give Adnan a whole lot of leeway to forget and re-remember differently, but don't extend the same ""benefit of the doubt"" to Jay. Moreover, the things are deemed ""not good enough"" to convict Adnan, seem perfectly acceptable (to some) to convict Jay."	20141201T050322

dixjours	2	0	What independent evidence do you have that Puff the Magic Dragon wasn't real? There's zero evidence that Gutierrez contacted her and Asia has repeatedly said she did not. That means there's actually proof of a negative fact in this instance, which is an extraordinarily rare thing. And also a point that makes me question my own wisdom in letting inane reddit questions like this bog me down and waste my time.	20141202T114740
dixjours	1	0	"This is what you said: ""Do you have access to the trial transcripts? If so, where did you get them from? If not, how can you know how the case against Adnan was presented in court? Do you really think you can pass judgment on what happened during a six-week long trial on the basis of a few hours worth of podcast and some snooping around on the internet?"" You question whether a lawyer can assess a case without reading all six weeks of a trial transcript. And you're wrong."	20141202T114410
dixjours	1	0	I doubt you're a prosecutor so I'm not sure you really know what a prosecutor would do. Asia's statements are part of a fairly simple and plausible narrative that she has clearly explained on the podcast, which is why I won't bother repeating it here. Ironically, no, Jay did not repeat the same things over and over again. Jay lied, he admitted to lying, and even his official recorded statement to the police had to be very carefully coached and massaged by the cops, and *even then* it was full of inconsistencies. Apparently, inconsistencies only matter to you when convenient.	20141201T143930

The witnesses might have made a leap to ""in the shop"" in their own minds or when discussing if with each other later. Since that's a common reason, if not the most common reason, to ask for a ride, one of them may well have just assumed that is what he said and then repeated it (either before or after Adnan was arrested)."	20141202T125200

Anyway, this is just a waste of time. You are not addressing my points at all. Also, you seem to think that anyone other than you is an idiot (judges, other lawyers). Maybe you should give other people's intelligence a bit more credit?"	20141202T132022
partymuffell	-1	0	I'm not a prosecutor, but it's a matter of common sense what a prosecutor should ask Asia in cross to persuade the jury that she might not be a reliable witness (the jury is not made up of prosecutors either, after all!) Since Asia wrote to Adnan in prison, I assume the prosecution had access to copies of her letters and anyway it's easy to cast doubt on the fact that Asia remembers the correct day and was sure she saw Adnan at the correct time (remember she was at the library before school let out and she was irritated at her boyfriend being late, which is the sort of thing that make you tend to overestimate time). Anyway, even if you are right and Asia wasn't pressured into signing that affidavit, then that means that Asia lied as well when she called the prosecutor and told him she was pressured. Asia's story is not straightforward at all, actually, but I see you have already made up your mind and I have already made up mine, so there is no point in continuing this discussion, but, since Gutierrez can no longer defend herself from the summary accusations of a fellow lawyer, I thought I'd say something in her defence. I don't think there is any incontrovertible evidence that she didn't do the best she could with the cards she was dealt with (i.e. a guilty defendant who refuses to admit his guilt (at least publicly)) and the appellate judge thought the same too. I'm sorry to see you are so willing to throw her under the bus just because Rabia and SK are willing to cast shadow on her despite the fact that she can no longer defend her conduct in this case and we don't really know what she knew about the case that we might not know.	20141201T155947

And **Gutierrez could've reasonably concluded that Asia was offering to lie in order to help Adnan.** But I guess you think that even the appellate judge came up with ""a ridiculous stretch of logic to disbelieve Asia"", right?

If these are the arguments in the appeal, I don't think Adnan has much of a shot. There *was* an eyewitness tying Adnan to the crime: Jay. You can argue that he's not a credible witness, but to claim that there is no eyewitness? It sounds to me like they're grasping at straws. The Gutierrez thing *might* go somewhere, but it's already been ruled on in a prior appeal. Is there something new in this one? So far, it doesn't sound Adnan's chances are very good.	20141130T201813

We're only reading a story about the appeal, rather than the appeal itself, so maybe Summer is mentioned, too, but I wouldn't count on that. I would guess that Asia's version of events *is* relevant because Gutierrez knew about Asia (not necessarily Summer, though), so Adnan can argue he had insufficient representation: His lawyer didn't pursue an alibi witness that she knew about at the time of the trial. Beside the fact that this issue was tackled in a previous appeal, Asia has recanted her statement. So ... there's even more reason to think that the Asia angle isn't going to payoff.	20141130T215246

And yet this appeal says he repeatedly asked about a plea deal? How can we not reevaluate him based on this?

All we know for sure is that Jay was involved in some capacity, he couldn't know about Hae's car otherwise.	20141130T221620

coolmotivestillmrder	2	0	I work really hard, but don't get to devote quite the time to a case a private attorney does. However, private attorneys must spend a great deal of time managing their business (obtaining clients, billing clients, managing staff, dealing with overhead, etc...) that I don't have to spend. Additionally, misdemeanors are not especially complicated and don't require a great deal of time unless they are going to trial. I do take cases to trial and spend weekends preparing for those. Misdemeanors can be fairly formulaic and don't require the investigation and negotiating effort a felony does. Occasionally they do, and I put in the time when that happens. The range of sentencing for a misdemeanor is so small, that there is essentially no difference between a private attorney's deal and a public attorney's deal for the same client. The prosecutors and police officers in our county have told me that. TL;DR Yes, my caseload is insane, but it is doable because I am in court for the majority of my workday (and only at my desk for brief periods of time to follow up on and/or prepare for cases). I would love to spend hours on each case, but that's usually not necessary. That would definitely be inappropriate for a felony docket, though.	20141206T012350

TrillianSwan	2	0	"I think Adnan said his questions about this came about because the other people in jail with him kept asking what his plea deal was and he was like, ""huh?"" I should post this farther up, perhaps, but also remember that at this point, they can only fight on technicalities, not evidence. So not trying to get a plea deal on the lawyer's part is a mistake, and they can only use her mistakes. It doesn't even matter if he would have refused it if she'd tried-- not trying is still an error, and they can only get it thrown out on errors now, and that's one, so why not use it? (I think the exception to the you-can-only-fight-errors rule is like the DNA evidence that the Innocence Project can turn up now on a given case, and that's only because science has advanced enough. I believe the thinking on that is, ""it couldn't be or wasn't routinely tested back then, but now it can so it's ok to use"".)"	20141201T080439
whatishappeninglol	1	0	I can completely understand why Adnan would ask what the prosecution were offering in terms of a plea deal, if the case was STRONG enough, or there was enough evidence in order to convict him. However, from listening to the podcasts, It SEEMS as though there was never a time when he was worried about being found guilty. So, in these circumstances, I do find it strange he would ask about a potential plea deal.	20141201T121245
anonymous	1	0	"because his extremely experienced attorney is part of my office, I trust his judgment in believing his client, and because he has an alibi that I find completely credible. Also the evidence against him was extremely weak. Do we ever ""KNOW"" anything for certain? No, and I've said as much in other comments. But this kid was innocent of these crimes, and he will serve a lot more time than his plea deal could have given him. The point doesn't change though- he rejected this deal bc he knew he was innocent and therefore thought our justice system would exonerate him. It makes me sad that it failed him."	20141201T040823

They said that, yes, if you are absolutely in love with the idea of snow that it probably wasn't the 14th. But they also mentioned that it would have been impossible for her to mistake the 9th and the 14th. She just misspoke. The ice storm cancelled school in the morning. That is what she remembers and that is what happened on the 14th. Do you honestly think Adnan's lawyer knows less than you about this?	20141201T204240

anonymous	13	0	Don't read into this too much. People CONSTANTLY plead guilty to things they did not do to get out of jail sooner. As an atty, one of the things about my job I hate most is advising an innocent person to take the plea bc for whatever reason I know they are going to get the book thrown at them at trial. Not saying that is Adnan's situation (as I believe his case was triable and winnable) but just want to make the point that you can't read into him wanting to plead as him being guilty.	20141130T194500

partymuffell	3	0	Yeah, I agree on both points. I'm just surprised that neither charge has been mentioned in the podcast so far. It goes to show how little we know of what happened during the trial, IMO.	20141201T051136

That attorney was the same person who defended Adnan, her last major trial, in fact. Rabia told me she thought the attorney botched the case-- not just botched it, actually, but threw the case on purpose so she could get more money for the appeal. The lawyer had died a few years later. She'd been sick.	20141130T201156

It’s not that she was napping during testimony or high on cocaine — she was a good hardworking attorney who made tactical errors in addition to a few out-and-out screw-ups,” says Koenig. “She was a really well-respected attorney! She had a great reputation, and it was earned. There are parts of the trial where you’re just like, ‘Man, she is just like a pit bull on this thing!’ She’s pushing and pushing and pushing. She’s objecting where she should and getting things on the record. She’s working hard.” Source: http://time.com/3541264/serial-this-american-life-sarah-koenig/	20141130T211248

Just because you have an SES doesn't mean every infraction will get you the original sentence. Your probation will be suspended until the new charge is adjudicated but then they'll often continue probation. In my experience it often takes 3 suspensions before you'll see a revocation, unless the new charges are as serious as the original. Most of the time it is the original sentence or maybe some additional drug testing or anger management added in.	20141130T205244

mostpeoplearedjs	24	0	1. The first case mistried only a few days in. A juror heard the judge call Adnan's attorney a liar. According to Rabia Adnan's side thought it was going well. 2. There have been some pretty good discussions on this issue.

anonymous	14	0	I do only criminal work. There are a number of reasons I can think of, many of them are the basic criticisms that SK has about him. Here are a few off the top of my head that MAY have come into play: - Can't fill in critical details that the jury will want to hear. Testifying will only make that clearer. - Can't alibi himself. Jury will be BEGGING for this. - sounds confused and forgetful, which the jury may read as lying - A scared kid who cannot speak with conviction in front of a crowd (things change in 15 years...) - Concern about jury prejudice against Muslims - His voice now is very tough and adult. If he came off at all scary back then, that alone may be enough reason- his presentation of himself. - HE DIDN'T WANT TO (don't forget, it is ultimately his choice) My personal belief? Because of his lack of memory of key details and lack of alibi, the cross would do way more harm than the direct would do good. That being said, the right attorney taking enough time to properly prep him could have made Adnan ready to testify I think.	20141130T195205
anonymous	12	0	An attorney posted a reply to this question in an earlier thread that made a lot of sense to me. They said that Adnan's lack of specific memories for critical times (but not others) on the 13th would prove a field day for a prosecutor. That the prosecutor would spend several days if necessary grilling Adnan on his exact whereabouts on the 13th highlighting the discrepancies between the times he does recall and those he does not. Their thought was that could be extremely damning for Adnan.	20141130T183807
TominatorXX	12	0	As an attorney (civil) I thought that an innocent defendant should ALWAYS testify. Some very experienced criminal attorneys have convinced me here that that is not correct. Even an innocent defendant may have good reasons to avoid taking the stand. Your speculation that he must be guilty or the attorney had reasons to believe he was has been repeatedly discussed. I think it's wrong for all sorts of reasons. You're basically wrapping double naked speculation -- he didn't take the stand, if he was innocent he would take the stand, ergo, attorney must have thought him guilty. It's just wrong and silly. Who knows why Guitierez did what she did.	20141130T190800
izatty42	10	0	We are hearing a 34 year old Syed, not a 17 year old Sayed. None of us have heard the 17 year old Syed, and maybe he was just not any good as a witness- weak, and not remembering anything, easily swayed off his narrative. Then of course there is the cross about drugs, sex, lying to parents.	20141130T194946
Archipelagi	9	0	"For any witness you call, whether the defendant or anyone else, you need to be sure that calling that witness will benefit your case more than it hurts it. As a general rule, this means that the only time you want to call a defendant to testify on their behalf is when they know a specific part of the story that cannot be introduced through anyone else. Otherwise, all you have done is let the prosecutor bat your defendant around like a mouse on cross-examination, allowed them an opportunity to score a few cheap points (and there are always cheap points to score), and failed to win any points to make up for it. And what evidence could Adnan have introduced here that would've help his defense? Starting from a position where you assume his innocence, is there any reason to think he would have been better off testifying? All Adnan's testimony would be on direct is that ""it was a normal school day, here's what I did on normal school days, I went to track, I went to a friend-of-a-friend's house and got high, I went to the mosque, and then I went home."" But all of this evidence was introduced by other witnesses, since we already have testimony about Adnan being at track at 3:30ish, and that he was probably there because someone would have remember if he was not. We have Cathy's testimony about him going to her house. We have his father's testimony saying he went to mosque. So there was literally nothing else for Adnan to add. And in return for gaining so little, it would have given the prosecutor a chance to have a field day on cross - innocent or guilty, they would have ripped his testimony to shreds."	20141130T192854
lukaeber	5	0	"I'm not a criminal defense attorney, although I did clerk for a federal judge with an active criminal docket. I think there are a variety of reasons why an attorney would not want their innocent client to testify, many of which have been discussed here in the past. One that I can think of that hasn't been discussed very often (to my knowledge) is that having your client testimony tends to shift the burden of proof (practically) away from the prosecutor and to your client. The question goes away from ""Did the prosecution put on evidence to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt"" to ""Was the defendant's story convincing."" Where the prosecutions case is weak, as it seemed to be in this case, I don't think I would want to put my client on the stand to make the case about his credibility rather than the prosecution's case. This is especially true where the prosecution's case is based on a single witness that has serious credibility problems, as was the case in Adnan's trial. Innocent defendants are rarely pure as the driven snow. They can, and often are, impeachable ... even if they had nothing to do with the crime at all. And if they truly had nothing to do with the crime, they are likely going to have a difficult time answering questions about the crime that they have no personal knowledge of. That might make them come off as deceptive, when in reality they are just ignorant. Unless my client had an air-tight alibi, I think I would generally lean against putting him or her on the stand. Cases with air-tight alibis don't go to trial though."	20141130T210642
anonymous	5	0	A close friend of mine and serial listener has been a lawyer for 30 years. When he heard adnan hadn't testified he said it basically cleared up any remaining question he had about whether he was guilty. He said he had seen lots of innocent people not testify but it was always because of ther criminal past. He said adnan would be the perfect person to testify as he had no record and great extra curriculars and seems to be well spoken. He said the only reason for someone like that to not testify would be if he told his lawyer he did it or his lawyer was convinced he did it.	20141130T232538
balogny	6	0	Non-USA lawyer here: I firmly believe that in most jury trials you should call your client. Despite the warnings of the judge the jury wants to hear the accused testify. That said in Canada the defense can chose not to have a key trial and elect judge alone (except murder cases where you need the Crown's consent).	20141130T182814
anonymous	9	0	I am not a lawyer, but from what I've heard on the podcast, the time where Adnan sounds most guilty are the times when he is talking. It's not that what he says sounds particularly suspicious or violent or sociopathic. It's just that he hedges. His alibi was track practice- no one can confirm that. He also claims that his alibi was the library where Asia might have seen him. Well, you can't have two alibis for the same time, which one was it? You don't remember where you were after school on the day your ex-girlfriend was murdered? How convenient. When SK asks why he didn't call Hae, Adnan gets flustered again and comes up with several different answers. He DID call her. Oh, wait, no he didn't. He was in contact with her friends at school. SK is pretty sympathetic toward Adnan and her questions aren't that hard, yet there are times where they make Adnan look bad. Wouldn't it be way worse for a prosecution? I realize that SK is asking him these questions 15 years after the fact, but it was not possible to confirm Adnan's alibi 6 weeks after Hae was murdered or the years following when he was on trial. Wouldn't the prosecution have been able to paint Adnan is super guilty based on the questions they ask him? Yes, memory is very crappy but this *was* a trial by jury, and if this sounds bad to me it would probably sound bad to people like me who sit on a jury.	20141130T183644

davidahn	2	0	"I'm sorry I missed earlier discussions, but they're too old to reply to. So... This is a catch-22: don't put the defendant on and risk looking like you're hiding something, or put the defendant on and risk him doing poorly on cross examination, or worse, ""looking"" guilty to the jury. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a physician. And there's a truism in medicine: if you want to get into a residency (training) program, don't do a rotation there as a student. Why? Your grades and resume probably looks better than your looks or personality. IOW, we all look better on paper because emotions don't get in the way. But once we show up, SOMEBODY is going to hate your face, hairstyle, clothing choices, personality, or one off-hand remark that personally offends him/her, and that person will quickly poison others against you.

captnyoss	3	0	I was lucky enough to do jury duty while I was a law student and my feeling from the two cases I did (one defendent didn't testify, one did - both were found guilty) is that irrespective of judge's orders about not taking regard of someone choosing not to testify, it's really hard to do. The quest for 'reasonable doubt' is really hard and I think having an alternate theory makes a huge difference. Academically it may not be a necessary requirement for the defence but in terms of convincing jurors it's very powerful. If Adnan had taken the stand he would need to be properly prepped which isn't the case when he calls up SK from jail, so I'd hope his testimony would be stronger.	20141130T205608
andrewcortex	4	0	This is a very very good point. It's already been pointed out (the initial police interview at his house with his father nearby) that had a difficult time being candid when his parents are listening. Sticking him on the stand would have been no doubt much harder.	20141130T221929

honestmango	2	0	"I'm not saying you're wrong, but as a trial attorney (civil), I've taken my fair share of cases to the jury, and I think I disagree with your premise about ""failing to win any points to make up for [the shots the defendant takes]."" First of all, taking the stand in and of itself was apparently important to jurors in this case. They were deeply troubled by Adnan's lack of testimony. We all know they are not supposed to consider that, but as a practical matter, they do. Secondly, I think Adnan WOULD score some points. Frankly, he has when given enough rope to hang himself. I think a more practical reason for him not testifying is that it opens a whole huge can of unknowns for a defense attorney. No case is ever as simple as people who haven't tried cases to jury think it is. If Adnan were to start testifying about events that hadn't been checked out or run down by his attorney, that puts his attorney in a really bad position. Practically speaking, with respect to a criminal defense attorney, I don't think anybody could legitimately argue that it was ineffective assistance of counsel to NOT let your client take the stand - but if you elect to do so and it backfires, you're an idiot. But again, I don't try cases based solely on how the appellate record is going to look, and that's a much bigger consideration for a criminal defense attorney. I try cases to win them, and if I have a believable client who tells a believable story in a way that makes the jury not want to kill him, that client is likely going on the stand. Then again, if he'd taken the stand, he likely could have removed all doubt about his guilt and we'd have nothing to talk about because he'd have been convicted in CONVINCING fashion, lol. You make solid points, and I appreciate them."	20141130T194700
ravonin	1	0	I love this argument and I think was part of the reason Adnan was not put on the stand (since he had no story and could not defend himself at all). I'd also like to add that in light of this, we should take that jury member's word with a grain of salt (on the disappointment of Adnan not testifying). If he had done it and not convinced the jury, that member would have done a 180 on her position about Adnan taking the stand.	20141201T004511
davidahn	3	0	"I can think of one reason, already outlined here by another poster: Adnan didn't remember what he did that day. If he can't HELP his case, then he can only HURT his case, either by being attacked on character issues or by having 1-2 jurors simply not like him and think he ""looks guilty."" I realize jurors make this logical error all the time, but they shouldn't: if he's innocent, he would testify, therefore he must be guilty. 25% of convicted felons exonerated by DNA have CONFESSED to the crime during interrogation, and when they recant, jurors say ""I would never confess if I weren't guilty, therefore he must be guilty."" Another huge problem I see is that not even the defense attorneys agree on the issue of whether or not to put the defendant on the stand; how is the jury supposed to make sense of what it means? I know they should ignore it, but they're only human. They're bound to infer SOMETHING either way, usually incorrectly (there are a myriad of reasons one may choose not to testify, also listed by previous posts). Jurors are called upon to examine the evidence ONLY, but we are humanly unable to do so: we filter evidence through personal biases, race or gender generalizations, judgments about whether the defendant looks or does not look guilty, lawyers' and witnesses' likability or societal acceptability, etc. We need a better system of justice than our flawed system. Maybe a panel of criminologists who don't see the defendant (no appearance bias) or even name, only the admissible evidence presented by two lawyers in writing (again to remove personality bias)? Anyone else with ideas?"	20141201T053508
honestmango	2	0	Yeah, but be careful with that. I've been practicing for close to 20 years, and if somebody had asked me the question yesterday, I'd have probably answered the same way.

djb25	2	0	Your friend either 1) isn't a criminal defense attorney or 2) is a terrible criminal defense attorney. There are countless reasons for a defendant to not testify. If the defendant has no useful information, there's no reason to risk putting him on the stand.	20141130T234058

honestmango	11	0	"It's interesting to me how people have very different reactions to the same information. I won't dissect what you're saying, other than I was under the impression that being in the library is something that would have happened before track practice, and it's super important if the prosecution argued she was killed prior to 2:36. Track practice didn't start until like 4:00, so in a way, I guess it's irrelevant whether he was at track practice or not. But my main reason for responding to your post is basically my belief that the premise of the show almost solidifies Adnan's guilt in my mind. If you did the exercise about trying to remember what you did on a random day 6 weeks ago, you had one of 2 results. You either could or you couldn't, and with my family, it was largely dependent upon a calendar entry. In my case, it was a weird day, and once I identified that it was a weird day, I was able to fill in a lot of gaps. Not all of them, though. I know I got new tires on a vehicle after lunch, I know that I left work early to travel to my kid's tennis match, and I know that I brought him back home for a choir concert that night. But anything before lunch, there's nothing there for me to remember. However, when the cops called me about my missing father in 1995, to this day I remember what I was doing and what I had done that day. The part about the day not sticking out in Adnan's mind is the biggest ""no way"" I have, and there are several. At this point, I think Adnan is the most likely suspect, and I can't say that his trial was conducted in such a way as to require that the conviction be overturned, but I also don't think he should have been convicted. There is reasonable doubt in this case...but I think a lot of the reasonable doubt in my mind is the result of Adnan talking to a reporter. Right or wrong, I'd have let him testify."	20141130T190212
GoodMolemanToYou	5	0	The library and track practice are not conflicting alibis.	20141130T185349
davidahn	6	0	His lack of specific memories to me is clear evidence of INNOCENCE, not guilt. You know who has a very clear, minute-by-minute accounting of their movements at the time of a crime? The perpetrator creating an alibi. You know who has NO REASON to remember what they were doing at the time of a crime, unless something memorable also happened? Someone who DIDN'T do the crime. Unfortunately, this is not the kind of physical evidence that helps Adnan, or any innocent person, because a guilty party could fake having no memory, though most perpetrators would rather have an affirmative defense in the form of a fake alibi. As the lady from the Innocence Project said, this happens all the time with innocent people: they have no idea what they were doing at the time of the crime.	20141130T195604

Archipelagi	7	0	Obviously it's a judgment call on whether any given witness is going to advance the ball for you or not. (Otherwise, litigators would all be out of jobs....) But I (and a lot of other attorneys) would never in a million years have put Adnan on the stand, so I do think the idea that his failure to testify being a sign of his guilt is completely bunk. It's not that I'd be concerned about his testimony as to specific events. If the defendant's not a total dipshit, they can stick to a basic story at trial. But it's everything the prosecutor would get to ask: Isn't it true that you were upset about Hae breaking up with you? Isn't it true that you kept trying to get back together with her when she broke up with you the first time? Isn't it true that you didn't want her to break up with you the second time she dumped you? Isn't it true that you wished she hadn't broken up with you? Isn't it true that you and Hae used to have sex in the Best Buy Parking lot? Isn't it true you lied to your parents about your drug use? Isn't it true you lied to them about having a girlfriend? You often left school to go do drugs, didn't you? You knew that Hae had gotten a new boyfriend almost immediately after breaking up with you, didn't you? And didn't that make you upset? You weren't bothered at all by the fact that your serious girlfriend who just broke up with you was now dating someone else? and on and on and on. And there are a couple big differences in criminal cases that make the calculation of whether to testify different. Like you mentioned, there's the appellate record to consider. And in a civil case, the other side can always call your witness for *their* case, if they think he or she is going to be a hilarious mess that will help them. So you might as well call the witness yourself and introduce them with a much more favorable direct. Also, in a civil case, their is no constitutional mandate that the a witness's failure to testify is not itself evidence of anything.	20141130T201538

If he was a teen while you were an adult 15 yrs ago, there's an extra layer of attention to detail, perspective, and maturity you had that he didn't.	20141130T191138
davidahn	1	0	"Thanks for validating my point and my profession, @honestmango. I love MedMal lawyers on MY side, but there goes my personal bias. :) Here are my impressions from 2 years of psychology in med school and decades of human observation: negative impressions spread like wildfire; positive impressions spread more slowly. Negative impressions bias you toward guilt; positive impressions are not evidence of innocence, so will often not be used in the defendant's favor. So call me pessimistic, but I don't see what's in it for the defendant to get on the stand. After watching too many cases of innocent people convicted simply because they were next of kin and no violent offender turned themselves in, I have lost a lot of faith in the ""system."" There are a few bad apples who will lock anyone up to close the case, pad their numbers, or win re-elections, but the vast majority of the wrongful convictions are perpetrated by good human beings with all too human biases based on probabilities, which leads to confirmation bias filtering (bend the evidence to fit the theory, ignore evidence that doesn't or can't be bent to fit).

The_Chairman_Meow	8	0	You need a warrant to pull phone records, and you need probable cause for a warrant. Being an ex-boyfriend isn't probable cause. The cops got an anonymous call pointing them to Adnan, and it was that phone call that gave them their probable cause.	20141130T190314

I presume they spoke to/checked out Don straight away, as well as looking into the family, and they may have spent some time doing general checking around her friends and found nothing of note.

Sheeps	1	0	No, not at all. This thread of comments in no way addresses the OP's question of why the detectives didn't call Adnan in for questioning prior to his arrest. My guess is that they wanted to wait to question any suspects until they could confront them with hard evidence or witness statements. As soon as they got that, through Jay's confession of involvement and implication of Adnan, they did bring Adnan in. If they had brought Adnan in as a shot in the dark before they had any information he could have covered his tracks or otherwise made things more difficult for the detectives (for example, by convincing Jay not to talk or by creating an alibi by convincing someone to cover for him).	20141201T010857

The_Chairman_Meow	7	0	"It's kind of complicated, so stay with me here. At the very beginning of this sub Rabia's younger brother Saad participated in a AMA, which is a reddit-specific type of crowd sourced interview. (AMA means Ask Me Anything.) *Adnan's* younger brother Yusef also posted a few things in that thread. Yusef mentioned a sketchy guy who's a member of their mosque named Bilal. Yusef claimed that Bilal was a pedophile who was little regarded in the commuity. Yusef also claimed that it was Bilal who actually gave Adnan the cell phone. He believed that it was Bilal who made the anonymous call to the cops for revenge against Adnan for Adnan rebuffing Bilal's sexual advances. He also insinuated that Bilal was the real killer. How that makes any sense is beyond me. So no one really paid much attention to this until a few days later, when someone claiming to know Adnan personally posted a thread known as the psychopath thread. The poster made a lot of accusations against Adnan, including that Adnan used to steal money not only from the mosque, but from the coat pockets of the congregants while they were praying. At least one different person showed up and backed up the OP's statements. So this thread was a **massive** clusterfuck, and Rabia showed up, made some weird threats, promised to have all of Adnan's friends come on and refute everything. But then Yusef showed up. And outright accused the OP of being Bilal. Yusef called the OP a child molester, and lots of horrible things. Yusef then sort of freaked out by what he himself was accusing this OP of, deleted his comments and deleted his account. If you search ""Saad AMA"" and ""Adnan is a psychopath"" you'll find these threads. You can't find Yusef's original comments, but another Redditor helpfully screenshot them before they were deleted. He or she posted the images in that thread."	20141130T212146
Sheeps	1	0	I'm not saying that I support this view, I'm just saying that it's not an unreasonable conclusion to draw. Even if one viewed Adnan as having no involvement in the crime whatsoever, one could still be a little disappointed in his lack of memory of that date. Given that Hae was Adnan's ex-girlfriend that he remained close with, it's not unreasonable to expect him to put more emphasis on her being missing than the average student at Woodlawn. Adnan also received a call from the police and from Hae's brother, (presumably) unlike most other students.	20141201T015453

anonymous	3	0	To give some context for the teal deer types: Shawn Armbrust heads the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project. Ken Burns (Yep, Civil War and Baseball guy) made a documentary on the Central Park Five's false convictions and how it happened; he was receiving an award for making the film. Jim Trainum is the detective who has been fighting against flawed interrogation techniques and who was in TAL's *Confessions* episode and was hired to consult on *Serial*. Saul Kassin is a Distinguished Prof Psych at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and one of the major academics behind false confession psychology. All four have deep and wide knowledge of the systemic failure points that lead to manipulated confessions, and how confessions -- false or not -- are highly problematic for both defense and prosecution. (A prosecutor with a false confession is making a flawed case.) The panel is long -- almost 2 hours -- but interesting and IMHO worth the time. Trainum is much less guarded and careful when speaking of generalities than when addressing a specific case, and his criticism of interrogation techniques is pointed. He is highly critical of the concept of taking a theory into interrogation. Armbrust is currently working on a DC case with similarities to the Syed conviction, and discusses the problems -- including the fact that despite exculpatory DNA evidence, the state has fully committed to their (once considered shaky) theory. Kassin speaks of the motivations for giving a false confession, the factors that lead to them, and the internal culture of law enforcement and judiciary that perpetuate this systemic failure, as well as tested alternatives from other countries that have abandoned our flawed techniques.	20141130T185233

prettikitti89	5	0	And why wouldn't Adnan confirm the existence of such a phone to SK? She's so desperate to find it, you'd think her phone friend would help her out. If he went there to smoke pot so often without a cell phone, he would probably be able to say there was a pay phone around. I agree. The slip up is weird and telling.	20141130T191430
pj12341234	2	0	From other's posts, it appears there where phones in the Best Buy lobby. Adnan may have know they where there, particularly if he regularly stopped there for a smoke etc. It's Jay who claimed there was a phone booth in the parking lot, not Adnan, so Adnan referring to phones in the lobby doesn't imply guilt on his part.	20141130T235325
glammer17	1	0	"Yes, definitely discussed. There is also a lengthy discussion if you search Best Buy Lobby - Called there IS a Phone at Best Buy. Anyway, I personally feel he is just restating whatever it was Jay claimed - but with the correct information (maybe he doesn't realize that every third word out of Jay's mouth is more than likely incorrect). To me this is possibly more damning to Jay because it's just another example of faulty information, made up story, and Adnan potentially being unaware of all of it and assuming that if Jay says Best Buy pay phones - surely he means the ones that actually existed - in the lobby. I believe Jay noted that he drove up and saw Adnan by the pay phone before the infamous trunk pop happened.. If you claim to have seen someone - I am pretty sure you remember whether or not they were inside or outside, but I guess it's possible to confuse it. On the other hand, if the trunk pop happened - and it's cold/winter - why would Adnan be sitting by the phones when he could be sitting in a car? AND - why would he call Jay to come get him at that time when he still had a car to dispose of, since the point was to ""pick him up""? Did they just leave it at Best Buy? I guess I don't remember that part? That said - if it's just a mistake that Jay said phones outside and he meant inside...didn't Jay also claim that Adnan called and said something along the lines of ""that bitch is dead, come get me.""? That would mean Adnan said that from the lobby of a popular store.. in the middle of the day. Not to mention that Best Buy is known for having employees standing near their front doors as well... Just seems a little fishy to me, then again - I guess all of this whole thing does! ;)"	20141130T193126

Nutbrowndog	2	0	Ugh this only goes to your point about 'why not sit in the car?'. If we are to create a scenario where there is a body in the car one has every reason to not sit in that car.	20141130T194545
cbr1965	2	0	Of course it isn't that significant because most of his details don't make any sense anyway.	20141130T214440
Nutbrowndog	2	0	I felt the same way until I read his entire police transcript (long). Maybe it's just me but I read emotion, fear and panic into it.	20141130T202927

pj12341234	1	0	True, but he also has every reason not to wait around a murder scene waiting for Jay, when he could easily have driven the car somewhere else himself and asked Jay to pick him up wherever he ended up.	20141130T235657
anonymous	2	0	fair enough. he should have every reason to feel every one of those emotions, guilty or not.	20141201T011119
Superben14	7	0	At the time of the murder I was 12 years old. There is no evidence that I had previous contact with the deceased. Where are you going with this line of questioning?	20141130T185555
