4,bppitcher,20230228T023617,1,We Were Three,"Sorry but as soon as Nancy Updike decided to interject that she 'didn't know how people who live in a country with a functioning healthcare system' I started to lose interest. So, if you embrace that line of thinking ( and that all healthcare should be free) you will at least feel right at home. Episode 1 is somewhat interesting if you like hearing about people who can't think for themselves but then Episode 2 quickly degenerates into a story about truly unlikeable (and perhaps not believable) Rachel. Ten minutes into the second episode I had enough and shut it off. Don't waste your time.","Sorry but as soon as Nancy Updike decided to interject that she ‘didn’t know how people who live in a country with a functioning healthcare system’ I started to lose interest.

6,The_Real_Honest_Reviewer,20230222T040224,1,"Gross, Unveiled Racism With No Journalism In Sight","If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, ""Nice White Parents"" is not for you. If you want a hate piece targeting white people, then enjoy this misleading propaganda. This podcast spews a slanted viewpoint that white parents are everything, and the only things, wrong with NYC schools. Whether they enroll their kids, fail to enroll them, run the PTA or merely participate — it is all criticized as the narrator tries to prove her prejudiced point of view. This self-proclaimed ""reporter"" admits in episode 5 that she ignored evidence of white parents working on yet another integration plan because she decided, without any investigation, that their effort was inadequate and uninformed. All the while she criticizes every move white parents make, she refuses to criticize the POC who wrongly accuse the white PTA parents of stealing money. She neither acknowledged the fact that the non white students clearly don't want the white students present nor criticized their blatant racism. And while belittling the participating white PTA parents (sole reason: their participation numbers are higher than nonwhite participants), she gives a free pass to the non-white parents who chose not to participate. She never asked why aren't the minority parents more involved. Instead, she apportions all the fault of the NY school inequality to white parents — and only white parents — while inadequately trying to prove that everything white parents do is wrong. I listened because Sarah Koenig's name is attached. I am embarrassed that she put her name on such poorly reported project. I expected more from Sarah. Her credibility has taken a hit by this lackluster race-baiting piece. The narrator here only researched, or only included, facts and opinions that support her desired story-outcome. She did not diligently follow facts; she selectively sought ones that aligned with the woke, white-shaming picture she sought to paint. This is only half a story and it was told with the sole purpose of making an anti-white propaganda statement. This was a shameful and gross misuse of this formerly-reputable platform. I'd give negative stars if possible.","If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, “Nice White Parents” is not for you.

I relistened to season 1 recently and concluded that yea, he totally did it and the podcast gives Adnan the benefit of EVERY doubt pointing to racism and xenophobia as the reasons why our justice system could possibly find him guilty. I certainly don't know what really happened, but I know Adnan is a liar or at least he's a half liar with an awful spotty memory. Season 2 was ok, but boring. Bergdahl was painted a bit too rosey in my opinion. I couldn't get past episode one with season 3 out of sheer boredom and disinterest in swallowing anymore propaganda, so I can't fairly comment. Based on the comments I'm reading, don't waste your time unless you can believe the hogwash information coming from media concerning Covid the last couple of years. I'm not even a dyed in the wool Republican, but trash like what this podcast and others adjacent like it (NYT, NPR, etc) are dishing out is pushing me more and more towards conservatism.","Season 1 of Serial was the first podcast I ever listened to and opened the door to the podcasting world.

Disappointed to be getting just another stale variation of the same story from Serial in which the same tired themes are discussed, and I don't care about the subjects/characters. Adnan Syed's, Bo Bergdahl's story, and even (because let's be honest, it was a Serial podcast) John McLemore were unique people with unique stories, that I cared about - and yes, all three had a political angle, but it wasn't the sole focus, it was a backdrop. Nice white parents? The Cleveland court system? The one about North Carolina? This new one? I wasn't invested and found them utterly forgettable. Characters, intrigue, and a focus that is not entirely about social justice issues - that's what I want. Focusing on institutions at the expense of plot is not a recipe for success.","Yet another podcast about local power and identity politics from Serial? Sarah Koenig and company are a one trick pony.

To be clear, I don't disagree with the agenda to bring a light to, condemn, and reverse islamophobic impacts of the letter.

First, the narrator (and really she talks a lot, rather than letting her subjects tell a story) has a voice meant for print. Really - as if she were raised in Wisconsin and then moved to Brooklyn at age 22. Just brutal. Second, despite her own protests about bias - this was a silly. She is quick to dismiss actual voter problems as minor (both at the nursing home and another violation two years later), finding all kinds of nuance among sides she supports, and then paints with a broad brush against ""Republicans"" or ""White people."" The gross elements of her being a truth teller by going into a community of color and being the righteous sympathetic judge is really too gross to be taken seriously. It is as if she just discovered that communities of color have diversity/heterogeneity/nuance. This was a massive waste of time, painful to hear, and simply appalling to listen to.","Loved Serial Season 1. Two and three were weak; this is awful.

I am tired of Young people who don’t know what they’re talking about dividing this country with their WOKE ideology. Honestly, if I were a black person in America I would be insulted that this generation think I too stupid to wipe my own butt. I come from mixed race. My great grandfather was an African Slave. TRUST me when I say, none of us were or are stupid and anyone thinking that you can’t rise above the color of your skin in modern America is not well educated. So no thank you Sarah, I’m taking a pass on this on and hitting the ole unfollow button."

(Season 1 Review),"Listened to this when it first came out and loved it, completely agreed with her points and believed that adnad was innocent. Recently I got back into it (season 1) and started to pick apart the flaws in his story. I did some research and the state DID have a decent case against adnad. One of the most confusing things about him, and what really makes me side with jay, is that HE CANNOT REMEMBER ANYTHING. He doesn't even try making anything up, he just says ""I don't know"" or ""I probably did this."" I understand not remembering specific details, but at least when jay told his side of the story (and yes I understand that jays story has some holes in it and he can seem to be unreliable at some points) he gives a story! I understand why adnad was convicted. Also Sarah is VERY biased throughout the first season. Not going to lie though I have re-listened to this podcast many times. She is a very good journalist, but I think that she didn't take the right stance on this case. She should have gone into without a bias and explained both sides of the story before giving her opinion (that's what I would have liked to hear). She makes herself seem so unbiased in the beginning, but it's obvious by the second episode whose side she's on. Another thing that really annoyed me was that she downplays how ""obsessed"" adnad was with hae- and how controlling he could be. She completely brushes it off! Even when literally reading evidence of it! Anyways if you have gotten this far, I recommend you listen to the first season and form your own opinion. Do some research or, if you're a nerd like me, look up the trial transcripts. But PLEASE, whatever you do, don't form your opinion solely on this podcast because trust me with one google search you can find many flaws with what some of the things Sarah is saying. But overall it's not a bad listen, again she is a great journalist.","Listened to this when it first came out and loved it, completely agreed with her points and believed that adnad was innocent. Recently I got back into it (season 1) and started to pick apart the flaws in his story. I did some research and the state DID have a decent case against adnad. One of the most confusing things about him, and what really makes me side with jay, is that HE CANNOT REMEMBER ANYTHING. He doesn’t even try making anything up, he just says “I don’t know” or “I probably did this.” I understand not remembering specific details, but at least when jay told his side of the story (and yes I understand that jays story has some holes in it and he can seem to be unreliable at some points) he gives a story! I understand why adnad was convicted. Also Sarah is VERY biased throughout the first season. Not going to lie though I have re-listened to this podcast many times. She is a very good journalist, but I think that she didn’t take the right stance on this case. She should have gone into without a bias and explained both sides of the story before giving her opinion (that’s what I would have liked to hear). She makes herself seem so unbiased in the beginning, but it’s obvious by the second episode whose side she’s on.

It was just a retelling of the story that's already been told which was in the limelight of the news. Season three was boring completely.

I'm on sure as to why this podcast ventured away from how they took to season one.

This is a high quality and slick production that's fun to listen to, but the episodes are clearly and unabashedly trying to pit listeners against those whom the creators of Serial have already decided are the big ""baddies"" without letting listeners decide for themselves. For example, before we even hear a law enforcement person speak in episode 3, Koenig says, ""He lamely responded..."" and then includes a quote from this person. Why don't you let us decide whether his response was ""lame?"" We very well might do that on our own if you give us a chance, but force feeding us your views is both patronizing and annoying. I see from reading other reviews that I'm not the only person who feels this way. There's not much nuance here so far, and I hope things get better. I loved the first two seasons, and I want to keep loving Serial! Just give us honest and objective reporting. Let us draw the conclusions.

People aren’t interviewed to gain insight, instead they’re queried in the hopes of the perfect sound clip to brandish as supporting evidence of a one-dimensional , oversimplified argument. No one, including the audience, is expected to actually think about the subject matter or the message of podcast. After the fifth episode I moved on to better shows."

1770,kajhejenfhutn,20181009T062110,1,Police Life,"I am not sure this will get read, but I want to address the issues regarding police officers and their approach to criminal activity. The reporters in this series seem to think that by questioning citizens who continuously have run ins with law enforcement or questioning police officers who do their jobs to enforce the law that they now know what should be done in these difference cases. Being a police officer is much greater than one case here or there. It is a lifetime of service to a community that usually is met with hostility, disrespect, and hatred. It is one of the hardest careers that any one human being can take on. A picture and narrative has been painted that if any use of force is used that it automatically is unfair and incomprehensible. How in the world can and would an officer use force? My suggestion is to go on a ride along with officers in major metropolitan areas and see for yourself what goes on in the streets. See for yourself how officers are talked to and treated. People wonder why force is an issue, but don't stop to wonder why? Officers, the majority of them, do not want to have to use force to get the job done, but when people don't listen and refuse to respond to commands given lawfully by a person who holds the authority to do so, it will end in a forceful action taken by a police officer. It likely will not be pretty and someone is bound to get hurt or possible bleed. It is very rare that we see true excessive force that is charged in cases against officers, because there is usually a command that was not obeyed. While I enjoy listening to your podcasts, I cringe when I hear a constant disdain for law enforcement and the women and men who put on a uniform day in and day out, leave their families and serve and protect people they will never know nor will they ever get thanked for doing so. There are always opportunities for growth in law enforcement as there is in any profession. There is also a lot of room for growth on holding people accountable for their actions and lack there of. We, as a community, need to stop fighting against the people who are trying to bring order to our communities and start supporting the effort in holding criminals accountable for their actions. If there are people who are constantly in contact with law enforcement, there is a problem and I can guarantee you it's not the fault of the police officers. My challenge to you all as reporters and the creators of multiple podcast's, do more research on what it takes to do the job as a police officer. What skills, reactionary disciple and patience it takes to deal with so many challenging individuals and communities. I feel that your reporting is extremely one sided and the communication that you do share is from some guy that didn't explain policing well at all. Maybe he did and you just skewed the podcast to make him sound like he didn't care about the community? I am not sure? Whatever the case is, be fair in your podcasts and show people that you can in fact try to see both sides. Be a solution to what you think is a problem instead of add more fuel to an existing fire.","I am not sure this will get read, but I want to address the issues regarding police officers and their approach to criminal activity.

This is true as well of This American Life but I have never felt it overwhelmed the story telling. Same with Serial until I get to this Season 3. Ms. Koenig does her listeners and her a great disservice because everything reported is told through her severely biased lens so unlike past seasons of Serial where there is room for listeners to make up their minds, here Ms. Koenig not only tells you the story but also tells you what you ought to think about that story. The words she chooses; the way she sets things up strikes the tone that led 60 million deplorables to vote the current clown into the White House, the pseudo-intellectual, superior attitude of you 'if you don't share my point of view, you're ignorant and racist' shines through in every one of the three episodes.

Season one had an interesting story and a cast of charachters that were developed over time because no had ever heard of them. I feel like the producers were so pleased with themselves that they felt like they had to attack a headline everyone knew and that was their downfall. Instead of repeating a successful approach they felt like they had to jump to the top level when that's not what made Season One work. It's too bad but perhaps they can turn it around for season three. A little dose of humility from the abject failure of Season Two may help keep them grounded. It was awful.

3077,Nick McNulty,20160317T173018,1,Confirmation Bias In S2,"The true conflict of season 2 is between Sarah Koenig's pre-existing notion of the Bowe Bergdahl story and what she found actually occurred. It is clear that Koenig already had her mind made up that Sgt. Bergdahl was a valiant, conscientious objector who went AWOL in order to bring attention to army misconduct. Yet as the story progresses, all of her assumptions prove to be false. She attempts to blame the battalion for being mismanaged, the army recruitment process for allowing Bowe to serve, the GOP for blowing this issue out of proportion, his fellow soldiers for not being accepting, and America's short-sightedness for allowing this conflict to escalate. And by the end of every episode, there is a desperation to Koenig's voice as she realizes that none of her arguments hold any water. What she hoped would be a cut and dry story that reaffirmed her own opinions has proven to be the exact opposite; each episode shows that Bergdahl was a deserter with a bizarre moral code who returned home due to a politically-motivated trade. Perhaps the two-week gap between installments gives Koenig more time to try and discover more evidence that backs up her original POV, because every episode feels like more of a Hail Mary pass to justify Bergdahl's actions and the State Dept's decision to negotiate with the Taliban.","The true conflict of season 2 is between Sarah Koenig’s pre-existing notion of the Bowe Bergdahl story and what she found actually occurred.

This season has devolved from the investigation format into an analysis on military and political procedure, two things which grow tedious when featured for more than a single episode. Bergdahl is also a completely non-polarizing figure. There is no justification for the actions he took, and a lack of mystery to his actions. Whether he went AWOL because of a justifiable reason or not was answered early in the season, thereby turning the season into a biopic (biopod?) which is far less interesting. Next season, please return to the original format of a polarizing case. The only thing polarizing in Bergdahl's case is whether or not he lied about why he left his post. We already know that he did it. It would be like if Adnan admitted to the murder, and the season was about his justification for doing it. There is no recourse for innocence, which was one of the main reasons season 1 had such a stranglehold on listener interest.","First of all, great puns by me.

3209,Kendraleexxx,20160219T135550,1,Poor Sarah,"I listened to Season 1 several times due to the terrific reporting and conflicting evidence and frankly the charm, intelligence and charisma of Adnan Syed. Season 2, about Bowe Bergdahl, fails for many reasons. First, he does make a convincing case for himself and it's just hard to keep listening when you feel that he was so reckless walking off his post. Second, Mark Boal was a terrible choice for an interviewer. He is flip, often drops the f-bomb instead of deploying a real word with meaning and robs the series of Sarah's skills as an interviewer. Third, Sarah seems much less professional in this series (i.e., her ""whateves"", her inability to release it on time and stick to the weekly release, then dropping two episodes in a row,, her reporting on the Syed hearing from a closet, etc.) I have given the podcast 8 episodes before reviewing to be fair. It is so disappointing. It seems such a strange choice of subject matter as the army is not known for nuance. There is nothing compelling here.","I listened to Season 1 several times due to the terrific reporting and conflicting evidence and frankly the charm, intelligence and charisma of Adnan Syed.

Bergdahl appears to be so stupid, I'm not sure I can listen to the season. I was in the military and understand fully the frustration of feeling you are being directed by incompetent leaders. There are ways to address incompetence. Bergdahl doesn't come across as smart enough to be a whistle blower. He comes across as uninteresting, naive, and stupid. Thus far, I don't care about him or what happens to him. I will give the 2nd episode a shot to see if it picks up at all. If so I'll hang in there; however, I am skeptical given what we learned in the first episode. I can't speak to his pending Courts Martial, but if episode 1 is any indicator, he is indeed guilty of gross stupidity.","I was a big fan of the Season 1 and was looking forward to the 2nd season.

For one, I get a general sense from every interview that pulling this 15 year old case from the grave was done in a less-than-tactful manner. There's something a bit pompous in the way that the producers approach the subject, as if they already have an axe to grind. The listener should also consider that these are real lives at stake here. The victim's family is pulled through what I am sure is an unending nightmare for them; the producers even have the gall to attempt approaching the family toward the end of the season. Compound this with the fact that the details of this case are just so ticky tacky and wishy washy that it's downright hard to care. Every single interview is a case of he-said she-said, and almost nothing here lines up. It could be that 15 years is a long time to ask of anyone to remember a few days' time, or the fact that half the people involved in this story seem to have been high as a kite while this whole tragedy was unfolding, or it could be the even more likely fact that no one really knows anything about this case and everyone is speculating on speculation. The producers feed into this speculation and even lead their interviewees down wild goose chases. Which begs the question: so what? What are we to garner from this 10+ hour ramshackle of a story? Are we to feel bad? For who? And about what? Toward the end, the series hints a bit toward the dysfunction of the legal system, which I think could have been a compelling ending, but the producers opted not to take sides on this matter. In all, I listened through to see where we would end up. But ultimately I wish I had gotten off at the first stop.","There's a lot not to like about Season 1 of Serial.

The production team did an excellent job of captivating the audience and turned this nonstory into a must listen podcast. If you are interested in creating a good podcast, pay attention to the technical expertise of these professionals. As for the actual story... don't waste your time hoping for actual content or substance. I'm sure the production team spent a lot of time on this, but I have to say the actual story is pretty cut and dry. Basically, guy A kills his ex-girlfriend and guy B helps him cover it up and then tells on him. Cue curtains. But here's what interests me... you always get the feeling Sarah wants to take her questioning to the next level, maybe badger Adnan a little or straight call him out. I can tell she wants to sit this pathological liar down in the interrogation room, underneath the blistering heat of an incandescent lamp and make him sweat- maybe make him strap on some tight shoes and then go old school upside his smug little smile with a telephone book. I wish she would have too. Ultimately, she just wants him to tell the truth and cop to everything because deep down, her instincts won't let go of the fact that he's guilty. But you can also tell her brain tricks her into giving him the benefit of the doubt- maybe because he's a minority. Maybe beacuse a 'white savior complex' compels her toward an errant quest of chasing shadows. But no matter how hard you might will it, Sarah, you can't rescue the hollow carapace of this pathetic perjurer- he doesn't even once say he misses her or show the slightest grief over her death, weren't they friends?! Sad really, because there are so many other cases of similiar verve in which the antagonist is actually innocent. Besides, if this were simply a case of the cops pinning a crime on the minority, they would have convicted the black friend- that train is never late! Finally, Adnan's zen-like resolution to his lot in life is not the discovered state of peace romantically connoted in similiarly fashioned tales of an innocent convicted of a crime he didn't commit; it is the tacit conclusion of a confidence man who got what he deserved. Upshot: MailChimp got their money's worth from every advertising cent spent on this podcast. I just hope Sarah eventually pitbull's in on a real story, one sturdy enough to warrant the Pulitzer she's capable of.","I have to hand it to Sarah and the crew, their expert skills of presenting a first class podcast cannot be understated.

We could have learned that info in like 10 minutes- not 45. Every episode I've heard should be 1/2 as long as it is.

I just quit in the middle of the one where she is interviewing an attorney and says ""I feel"" like 30 times in 4 minutes. (I'm probably exaggerating slightly:) There is way to much narration and not enough real listening. It's like listening to a friend tell you about a tv show plot or something- Please just show me...

Which can be interesting in small doses if there is insightful commentary or it is colorful in itself. Here it is all splayed out with little momentum behind it. The podcast combines the earnest storytelling charm of TAL with the morbid puzzle-solving of all our grandmas' favorites like Matlock and Murder She Wrote. What makes it seem unique is that's it's a new form for podcasts and it's not about elderly people. Once you get over that, the mystery and intrigue quickly dissipate. As a side note, Serial underlines the iPod's perplexing inability to order podcast episodes from oldest to newest. Listening to them in serial fashion, one must return to the menu between each episode to scroll up.","There’s lots of details about the lives of ordinary teenagers just like on Ira’s show.

I was on board in the beginning, now I'm just annoyed. If you don't want me to think Adnan is the killer, please give me at least one other viable suspect with possible motives. You'd think that after five episodes, this might have been mentioned, at least in passing. Maybe this is partly why every time I hear Adnan speak, my gut tells me he's guilty. Unlike the host, I don't find him very likable or interesting. He has the cadence of a liar. More importantly though, the handling of the story isn't nuanced or compelling. The repetitive examination of the same minutiae, episode after episode, is not deepening the tension / mystery, it's flattening it. I do like the premise of the show, and hope they might take some cues from other serialized forms of entertainment, but so far you have not left this listener wanting more.","At this point, the only thing this show has going for it is a really good theme song.
