Syd.14	20230308T035121	5	Season Three Episode One	If you are looking for a story that goes into the justice system but also has a interesting story this is the podcast. Sarah Koenig makes sure the listeners understands the story step by step. During the podcast they use old lips that Sarah goes back and forth explainingn why people are doing this. This was great listening to and totally recommended for others.	If you are looking for a story that goes into the justice system but also has a interesting story this is the podcast.

CharF28	20230308T011412	5	Great Episode	I think this is a great episode of Serial. I love how they always go in-depth into what they are talking about and how so much information also has people in the story so you don't get bored of the same person. Usually, I like to listen to podcasts on youtube so I can watch them talk but this podcast just keeps drawing me back in and always keeps me thinking so I don't need to see the actual people speaking. I really think people should watch this. It goes in-depth and you also learn the backstory and the now. You also get to learn things that we can do to better the justice system in America and you learn things that relate to your episode.	I think this is a great episode of Serial.

bppitcher	20230228T023617	1	We Were Three	Sorry but as soon as Nancy Updike decided to interject that she 'didn't know how people who live in a country with a functioning healthcare system' I started to lose interest. So, if you embrace that line of thinking ( and that all healthcare should be free) you will at least feel right at home. Episode 1 is somewhat interesting if you like hearing about people who can't think for themselves but then Episode 2 quickly degenerates into a story about truly unlikeable (and perhaps not believable) Rachel. Ten minutes into the second episode I had enough and shut it off. Don't waste your time.

The_Real_Honest_Reviewer	20230222T040224	1	Gross, Unveiled Racism With No Journalism In Sight	"If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, ""Nice White Parents"" is not for you. If you want a hate piece targeting white people, then enjoy this misleading propaganda. This podcast spews a slanted viewpoint that white parents are everything, and the only things, wrong with NYC schools. Whether they enroll their kids, fail to enroll them, run the PTA or merely participate — it is all criticized as the narrator tries to prove her prejudiced point of view. This self-proclaimed ""reporter"" admits in episode 5 that she ignored evidence of white parents working on yet another integration plan because she decided, without any investigation, that their effort was inadequate and uninformed. All the while she criticizes every move white parents make, she refuses to criticize the POC who wrongly accuse the white PTA parents of stealing money. She neither acknowledged the fact that the non white students clearly don't want the white students present nor criticized their blatant racism. And while belittling the participating white PTA parents (sole reason: their participation numbers are higher than nonwhite participants), she gives a free pass to the non-white parents who chose not to participate. She never asked why aren't the minority parents more involved. Instead, she apportions all the fault of the NY school inequality to white parents — and only white parents — while inadequately trying to prove that everything white parents do is wrong. I listened because Sarah Koenig's name is attached. I am embarrassed that she put her name on such poorly reported project. I expected more from Sarah. Her credibility has taken a hit by this lackluster race-baiting piece. The narrator here only researched, or only included, facts and opinions that support her desired story-outcome. She did not diligently follow facts; she selectively sought ones that aligned with the woke, white-shaming picture she sought to paint. This is only half a story and it was told with the sole purpose of making an anti-white propaganda statement. This was a shameful and gross misuse of this formerly-reputable platform. I'd give negative stars if possible."	If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, “Nice White Parents” is not for you.

msh441	20230205T195636	3	Infatuation And Prioritization	Great podcast series. Very well produced. I think season 1 and Adnan's case / exhortation in particular is a couple well spoken women (Koenig and McLean) becoming infatuated with a charismatic killer. A single witness in a library (McLean), some collected evidence that was deeming to be unrelated, and different interpretations of cell phone tower data is enough to ignore several eyewitness who were present when Jay and Adnan spoke about the crime, call recipients, and physical evidence that matches testimony. The explanation presented is 'witnesses forget', and dependence on tower data, from towers that have changed over the years. Specifically how they prioritize and hand off calls. Koenig should've spoken with Hae's friends and family more. The 'possessive stalker' behavior exhibited by Adnan was brushed over in episode 1, and never again comes up!?! Because Koenig is infatuated with him. A fact she acknowledges in multiple episodes. Adnan ultimately benefitted from stoked racial tensions of the day, and is a free man today.	Great podcast series.

Stereotypical, bleeding heart view, all complaining with no practical solutions to problems, just whining. The white establishment is inherently evil. Makes you wonder why the entire world wants to come and live in our white supremacist country? The journalism is good, thanks to Ira I'm sure.

Blashphmemer	20230122T012815	1	Has Aged Poorly. Disappointed	Season 1 of Serial was the first podcast I ever listened to and opened the door to the podcasting world. A stoned liberal at the time with little to no critical thinking skills, I wholeheartedly bought the notion that perhaps Adnan was innocent. I relistened to season 1 recently and concluded that yea, he totally did it and the podcast gives Adnan the benefit of EVERY doubt pointing to racism and xenophobia as the reasons why our justice system could possibly find him guilty. I certainly don't know what really happened, but I know Adnan is a liar or at least he's a half liar with an awful spotty memory. Season 2 was ok, but boring. Bergdahl was painted a bit too rosey in my opinion. I couldn't get past episode one with season 3 out of sheer boredom and disinterest in swallowing anymore propaganda, so I can't fairly comment. Based on the comments I'm reading, don't waste your time unless you can believe the hogwash information coming from media concerning Covid the last couple of years. I'm not even a dyed in the wool Republican, but trash like what this podcast and others adjacent like it (NYT, NPR, etc) are dishing out is pushing me more and more towards conservatism.

Beck1988	20230108T172412	5	Great Storytelling And Topics	Overall a great podcast that keeps you intrigued and hooked with their storytelling. Love how descriptive they are with their wording. Also love how in-depth they get in their investigations to find out more information (i.e. Sarah Koenig speaking to Afghanis in Season 2. What other reporters do that?) P.S. Don't listen to commenters giving poor reviews because they don't agree with the politics of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.

Sarag0621	20221229T180050	3	Should I Continue To Follow Serial	Like so many others I was intrigued with the first Season of Serial - I think I listened through the full Season 1 at least 3 times. Season 2 was definitely not as good - not really true crime investigation but I made it through. The next Season took a sharp turn political/social turn and while it was timely definitely had an agenda. I didn't listen to We were 3 and probably will not. I'm about 2/3 through The Trojan Horse Affair and although I am finding it interesting it's frustrating how Hazam is so focused on proving his ideas. He talks about how he graduated with a degree in investigative journalism but he clearly was not taught to be objective, to find the truth of the story aside from what he thinks personally, he seemed unable to separate himself from the story as though it was about him directly and that leads him to being defensive and quite immature. Of course I see how this government report seems to have exaggerated facts and took things out of context I think their approach was wrong but I think Hazam made the story less believable because he was so personally invested in it. That seems to be the way of journalism today especially in the NYT so I find it unremarkable that they are sponsoring this podcast.

I was really disappointed when I tried out this season and immediately discovered it was about fringe COVID vax conspiracists. Highlighting COVID kooks is just such poor taste right now. After everything we've gone through we ought to be going out of our way to be gracious to people for being crazy during that period. Lord knows the self appointed vax police were just as cringeworthy. I'll give you guys one more shot to pick a great topic but after that I'm out. S-Town was fantastic btw.

Nothing is going to be perfectly suited to your exact specifications, and no storyteller is going to change themselves for you. If the podcast isn’t for you, try mentioning some quirks that will help others decide to watch or not. Your over sensitivity to ideas that aren’t limited to your tiny box are unimportant."
Pulsefinder2020	20221109T102502	1	We Were Three	Rachel clearly has issues and Serial gave her an outlet to air her family's dirty laundry. I don't know these people, and I was given no reason to care. The podcast was not as advertised and quickly went off the rails. The interviewer had zero control over the direction of this podcast.

I absolutely cannot believe people are still swayed by this propaganda. I can't even tell if the writers intentionally aim for fantasy or if their ever-so-smooth brains believe the hot garbage they're spewing. It's just nauseating.

Of course she thinks he's innocent. A prosecutor, judge, and jury found this monster guilty. Don't you think they probably know more than all of us do about the case?

What was originally a true crime podcast has turned into leftist propaganda aimed at trashing the police. She claims to be so amazing for getting the opinion of someone who calls himself a conservative and then she doesn't even air what he said and calls him a racist more than once. Journalism is about providing the facts and letting the audience make up their own opinions, not providing your own opinions and telling the audience what to think. How disappointing.

And since he felt he did not have health insurance or money to be treated, he's at the lung condition gone too long. I agree that Resdemevir had a high rate of killing him. And yes look it up, the hospitals did get a bonus for patients that were put on a respirator or ventilator. Too much bad information here.

Go to Season 3 episode 6 for multiple frustrating examples of what I’m referring to. Not the only episode or season where this happens, but one of the more obvious ones.

The fact they allowed this to pass all checks and balances is disappointing."

Kadence404	20221012T043850	1	Sarah Koenig Lacks Journalistic Ethics	The fact serial never updated any aspect of season 1 until Adnand's release is gross. So much of what was critical to the narrative presented in season 1 has since been debunked (see cellphone records) and there were major holes in what was covered. It's one thing if you never go back and add disclaimers or updates to the original show. But to release an update episode covering adnand's release without addressing any of the original shortcomings or failures is aggravating. Serial had nothing to do with his release, it actually did him no favors. Sarah presents herself as a journalist, but I think it's obvious in hindsight that the original season was presented with intentional ambiguity to engage listeners. Plus season 2 was BORING and season 3 was even worse. I give serial no credit for season 4, that was an NYT project done by actual journalists and I listened to it in its own feed because I refuse to give this feed my listens. Sarah, you are the worst. Please don't make any more podcasts.	"The fact serial never updated any aspect of season 1 until Adnand’s release is gross.

Teacher<3	20220929T024137	4	Season 3	Any chance of a season 3 update? There was a lot of speculating in it about rehabilitation versus future reoffending, and about an unfair justice system's impact on people's futures. Seems appropriate to do a follow-up on the main stories from that season at some point... now that it's the future :) Or later after Joshua's been out for a bit!

Listener-unbiased	20220930T164402	5	I Love Serial	Other than the fact that as an American, I find the British accent difficult to understand due to the fact that they can speak very fast... the 4th season of Serial was raw and transparent a story really more about journalists and personal opinions, vision and overall goals of journalists and how one can distance themselves from emotions and life experiences when telling a story in a fair and unbiased way. The story itself and the dogged reporting and research is fantastic.

Myrickrackobsession	20220924T014315	5	Amazing!	Thoroughly researched, well written, and spoken so well by Sarah Koenig. I was hooked by the subject matter and throughout the episodes, I wasn't sure if he did it or not. She doesn't glamorize the crime in any way, but instead is respectful of both families. I have listened to other true crime podcasts that are very popular, but they are not as well-written nor told by someone as professional. Koenig's voice is very easy to listen to and I much appreciated her humor, only when humor was warranted. Based on my positive experience with Serial, I have become totally smitten with podcasts, but it sets a high standard.	Thoroughly researched, well written, and spoken so well by Sarah Koenig.

I hope that there is finally a clear direction of who killed this young lady. Seems like Jay and the man who apparently found the body need to much harder look.

Thanks to this podcast and those it inspired to work tirelessly, the conviction of Mr Syed was overturned on Sept 19, 2022. This is the true work of journalism, to shine light on injustice. 

Thank you Serial (team)"

The manipulative, lying, psychopath who started this entire tragedy...JAY WILDS is a BLATANT liar. HOWEVER, he DID tell the TRUTH about how HE MIGHT HAVE killed Hae Min Lee and everyone has totally ignored it! The PROOF has been there all along. The detectives, prosecutors, public defenders, and the entire judicial system was FAILED Mr. Syed in so many ways and it's absolutely despicable! This case should have NEVER gone to trial!

Go figure that of all outrageous stories they could have reported on they had to go with the one about racism. I don't for the life of me understand why media (which is the left's talking puppet on tv and radio) is so OBSESSED with racism. It truly has become a Snipe or witch hunt with them only this hunt has financial profits instead of laughing kids and tree decorations. This is a TERRIBLE PODCAST that lacks all entertainment value!

Bingbongdingdong	20220908T163237	2	Starts Strong, Takes A Bad Turn	The first two seasons are amazing. The deep dive of the first season, the nuanced new take on a story that had been heavily but shallowly covered by media in the second. Then the third season came around. It opens with an anecdote about a woman blaring music on a speaker in a courthouse elevator. The lawyers and courthouse workers in the elevator were judgmental. Why would anyone be judgmental of someone with a complete lack of social awareness being obnoxious? The narrator gives us the reason: racism. This is the depth of critical thinking for the next two seasons. Why does the criminal justice system favor people with money and influence? Racism. Why do wealthy people take an interest and get involved in their children's education? Racism. It's tiring. The first two seasons were great because they looked at the stories from different angles. Bergdahl was demonized by the press as a uniquely cowardly traitor, the reality was more complex involving hundreds of awol troops, untreated mental illness, and a military desperate enough for numbers it would look the other way. Adnan was a convicted murderer, case closed, but there was ambiguity and uncertainty in the evidence. Season 3 and 4: No complexity or nuance is worth exploring apparently. Serial's solved the case, it's racism and the racists who are racistly racisming everywhere.	"The first two seasons are amazing.

I enjoyed the season on Bowe Bergdahl somewhat. The one on the justice system was also super compelling and gratifying. Trojan Horse was enlightening from a cultural perspective. I kept hanging with it to experience the smoking gun that never came. But, as an American, it was eye opening to learn about the issues Muslims face in the UK, as I am sure they do in the U.S. in ways similar and dissimilar.

Unfortunately, the latest Trojan Horse Affair season (and even the 2 prior seasons), is far from that. Instead, we have to listen to a Muslim journalist who is clearly biased towards his point of view (he even kind of admits it in the show, so I guess that makes it ok?). He jumps to a conclusion before working on the podcast, and then spends the whole podcast searching for witnesses that fit his agenda, while merely brushing aside facts he comes across that are a pretty big deal for the other side, such as the extreme cases of sexism that were present in a public school. He spins everything as ""well, the school is predominantly Muslim, so that makes it OK"" or ""yeah, so a teacher taught students that wifes cannot deny husbands sex, and that same teacher also got jail time for having an affair with a student, but that's not extremism and the real issue is blah blah blah. I wish Serial would go back to neutral journalism, because the stuff they are coming out with now makes me want to vomit."

Second, where other podcasts — lazily and in droves — fall back on the podcast format as an excuse to shirk research, this podcast thrives on the format, creating more stories, fascination, accountability. Third, I say cautiously that The Trojan Horse Affair may be my favorite of the series...integrating Brian and Hamza's friendship into the thematic whole - just awesome.

Marilyn1M	20220423T010144	5	Bravo	"As someone who practiced journalism and walked away from it in despair at what it's become, I found the Trojan Horse Affair revivifying and heartbreaking at once. Your work shows brilliantly and honestly both how important investigative journalism remains to the functioning of democracy and how impotent it has become in the face of deeply embedded racism and corruption. I particularly loved how transparently you dealt with the issue of ""objectivity"" — a loaded and culturally relative term which should have been interrogated and abandoned in the US journalistic sphere long ago. Brian's pique at the apparent violation of objectivity on the part of Hamza was profoundly revealing. I'm so glad you included that in the series. I also loved how there is no gotcha at the end. That opaque and inconclusive conclusion is exactly the right note to hit when reporting on systemic racism."

WeatherGirlWendy	20220412T034620	5	Familiar	Just finished this series. Through the entire wild ride, I couldn't help but think that the accusations being leveled against the Muslim school staff of plotting to infiltrate and then hold students captive to their world view actually mirrored what is, in fact, the stated goal of conservative, evangelical Christians in parts of our country. The obfuscation and political whitewashing of that movement is equally maddening to me.	Just finished this series.

As PAOs, we have both worked with journalists from every media outlet in the 3-letter alphabet, as well as pretty much every top print outlet there is. And we both served in the Centcom PA office. To say we were both impressed with the depth, breadth and fairness of your series is truly an understatement. I know it's on older series, but wow. You did an amazing job telling this story.

Ifkemdj2838	20220325T123803	1	So Disappointed In Serial	Yet another podcast about local power and identity politics from Serial? Sarah Koenig and company are a one trick pony. Disappointed to be getting just another stale variation of the same story from Serial in which the same tired themes are discussed, and I don't care about the subjects/characters. Adnan Syed's, Bo Bergdahl's story, and even (because let's be honest, it was a Serial podcast) John McLemore were unique people with unique stories, that I cared about - and yes, all three had a political angle, but it wasn't the sole focus, it was a backdrop. Nice white parents? The Cleveland court system? The one about North Carolina? This new one? I wasn't invested and found them utterly forgettable. Characters, intrigue, and a focus that is not entirely about social justice issues - that's what I want. Focusing on institutions at the expense of plot is not a recipe for success.

This is a persuasive piece with a clear agenda, not valid investigative journalism. To be clear, I don't disagree with the agenda to bring a light to, condemn, and reverse islamophobic impacts of the letter. But the clear bias and lack of empathy given to concerns of sexism and abuse of girls weakens their stance significantly. This could have been a complex, thoughtful discussion of a complicated issue. It wasn't. The Guardian's Sonia Sodha wrote a piece that summarizes my thoughts exactly. I hope Serial does better in the future.

It feels like the entire story is being reported and pushed in a way that will affirm the pet theories and beliefs of the ""investigative reporters."" Huge disappointment, because the story is an interesting one that deserved more and deeper attention, and the concept of telling that story around the letter is a great idea.

First, the narrator (and really she talks a lot, rather than letting her subjects tell a story) has a voice meant for print. Really - as if she were raised in Wisconsin and then moved to Brooklyn at age 22. Just brutal. Second, despite her own protests about bias - this was a silly. She is quick to dismiss actual voter problems as minor (both at the nursing home and another violation two years later), finding all kinds of nuance among sides she supports, and then paints with a broad brush against ""Republicans"" or ""White people."" The gross elements of her being a truth teller by going into a community of color and being the righteous sympathetic judge is really too gross to be taken seriously. It is as if she just discovered that communities of color have diversity/heterogeneity/nuance. This was a massive waste of time, painful to hear, and simply appalling to listen to."

It feels like y'all fell into the guilty ""woke"" white people pressure of trying to cover relevant news S3 onward, but it's profoundly boring and I can't stand to listen ever since. There are so many other podcasts doing this work and in a way that isn't this tedious to listen to. S1 + S2 were so incredible because it felt like a film that got perfectly treated into podcast form in a way that was still incredibly relevant today's news and culture. Both of those first two seasons say way more about the country we've become than the desperate fake woke white person journalism happening in S3+. I appreciate your work, I just wish you all would return to form and to what made Serial so incredible in the first place, long form is where you shine. Please consider how trite it is to add to the noise the way these last few years of content do. It feels like content by people for white people to feel better during a civil rights crisis, whereas S1 and S2 feel accessible to everyone and have a huge impact that simultaneously provide startling commentary on the current culture. Sorry this is so long, it's been bothering me that every time I check for more Serial, it's just this same bloated fake-woke, current-climate journalism that we're already inundated with everywhere. It's very sanitized when you come to think of it! And Serial started out so much bigger than that!"	The first 2 seasons of Serial are some of the most memorable podcasting I can think of.

AmeeTaylor	20210911T040911	4	Serial Podcast Stories Are Added Value Information	I have loved Serial Podcast for a long time. I just listened to the five episodes of Nice White Parents (NWP). NWP held Serial podcast standards of added value information. I was ignorant on the subject of diversity in the US public school system. I had no information on the dynamics of white parents and minorities, and a system that favors one over the other. The podcast was easy to listen to and follow. The story of the Brooklyn public school system was very interesting. I gave four stars instead of five stars simply because some of the information was just difficult to stomach as black American who unknowingly grew up in a similar situation. Minus the NWP that tried and wanted to make a difference. Thanks Serial podcast for telling the important and worthy stories.	I have loved Serial Podcast for a long time.

jamesdbayer	20210917T155522	2	The Story Telling Style Is Great, But The Content Is Very Slanted	An underperforming school sees a group of white parents come together and all join the school at the same time. This happened because one of the parents was able to identify the program that was lacking, spoke to the principal about how to bring that program to the school, convinced the other parents that the missing program would be there, then provided all of the funding for that program. It really is that simple. What makes this an issue? The parents were white, nothing more. The existing PTA was stuck in their rut and wanted to maintain control. It was all about the control of money. The existing PTA couldn't see that they could work with the new parents and bring positive change. They literally had new resources available that they had never had before, but they wanted total control. Instead of trying to help the existing PTA recognize the new tools they have and bring unity, this author decided to create a podcast about how horrible white people are in general. It's the normal tripe that all white people are oppressors and all minorities are the victims. We are seeing it in the comment too. If you don't praise this podcast you are a racist, or some other word meaning the same thing. In the end it is about control and money.

That he was very demonstrative I his responses to them...which made me think, doth thou protest too much?

I'm not accusing him of anything, but his behavior sure makes you wonder.... Additionally, I believe Adnan should get another trial for the I effective counsel.

I expected to love it - I'm the target audience for this pod - white, liberal consistent contributer to NPR - but this is beyond the pale.

THIS IS ILLEGAL!	20210628T062124	5	Season 2 Is Excellent Reporting And Storytelling.	What happens when we continue to ignore that mental healthcare and education regarding mental health should be a bigger priority in this country? Bergdhal's experience and outcome are the result. This story is laid out beautifully with facts and first hand accounts told in cohesive, fair and compelling way that ties in such vivid descriptions you feel like you were there. Bravo.

I also think that there was racial issues that led to the police having tunnel vision . In the end they got the right guy, but brain development and reasoning are not fully formed at 17. I think he was a teen trying to cope with a breakup, possibly sociopathic tendencies and made an impulsive decision . I think a rehabilitation sentence was more suitable for this crime because of his age (after a 15 year sentence)	Although I think he’s guilty, because of his age, I don’t think he should have gotten life in prison.

Moreover, it's an extremely racist podcast that constantly talks about race and how bad white people are. Not impressed.

Liberal Politicians are always going against their rules they put on everyone else. So many are hypocrites, so I think being liberal is the biggest driver for their decisions, much more than color. Also, this just shows the FAILURE of liberal policies in liberal cities. Perhaps, focusing on that would have actually educated people. Instead, blaming people for being white is an easier scapegoat... that record is just getting a tad old. Dems have dont NOTHING for Blacks, look at inner cities, they have total control, yet, high crime, low education, no jobs.... easier to blame Republicans, but Republicans have NO local power. Under Trump, jobs were available... so who actually helped blacks?!? The media lies for the Dems, but slavery is what the inner cities have become under the Dems.

I started the first episode a couple of times and had the impression that this was going to be WOKE nonsense so I stopped and said I would go back later. When I opened the podcast this morning The reviews caught my eyes. I normally don't read the reviews because all of us enjoy something different. But once I read the reviews I was certain that I wasn't going to listen because I knew listening to this would only make me feel angry inside. I am tired of Young people who don't know what they're talking about dividing this country with their WOKE ideology. Honestly, if I were a black person in America I would be insulted that this generation think I too stupid to wipe my own butt. I come from mixed race. My great grandfather was an African Slave. TRUST me when I say, none of us were or are stupid and anyone thinking that you can't rise above the color of your skin in modern America is not well educated.

I had no context going in, other than my knowledge of the variety of topics covered in previous seasons. I didn't even have a vague idea of what this new season would be about. So, I wasn't really sure what to expect. And so, I don't think it is an overstatement for me to describe my decision to hit play on Ep. 1 as anything other than serendipitous. I really enjoyed listening to TIA ... like way way more than I was expecting to. I mean, it's focus is a small PAC, in a moderately small county in North Carolina. And while the drama does touch on national political events, most of the meat of the story is found in its present of local political fights and drama. Given that intensely local focus, and how distant that local scene is from my own experience (I live in a small rural MN county), I was surprised at how drawn I was to continue listening to this season. Well done Serial. Excellent script. Excellent narration. Excellent journalism.	"I went into TIA cold.  Didn’t listen to the preview. Didn’t read any reviews.

I don't think you covered how much police blatantly lie in their reports, often easily disprovable, but people still end up accepting the deal because of the situation they are in. Glad I rediscovered this show and thank you!	"Great podcast and you hit the criminal justice system right in its solar plexus.

rjb3324	20210430T123024	3	Another Unbiased Serial Podcast	These podcasts are very well done but they always have an agenda. Identity politics are what's tearing this country apart. The left will take down a woman, a person of color, or anyone in their way. It's sad. They're so blinded by ideology I don't know if they even realize they're doing it. Just listen how they talk about this guy Mark. A black man. They look at him like he's bad because he's objective and looking out for all people. Dr. King spoke about the content of people's character not the color of their skin. The left should remember that. Serial is doing a disservice to the country and all people but I'm not surprised they're linked to the NYT. Objectivity is something we need not propaganda. You're part of the problem!

The point of that season was to show how well-intentioned, moneyed, almost 100% white parents w/lots of clout and social capital can often misdirect public/charter school funds in a way that does not serve the multiracial, socioeconomically diverse student body. Fascinating overview of NYC public school system, and the history of the letter-writing campaign was very telling. This show is not saying ""integration is bad,"" or ""white people are bad."" It's saying, money and whiteness warps. Privilege and class background matter a lot in who gets a true ""education."" That said, I could've done without all the editorializing from the narrator/reporter. Bringing in a personal viewpoint muddies the societal trends the story examines. Four stars for me."

This show is not saying “integration is bad,” or “white people are bad.” It’s saying, money and whiteness warps. Privilege and class background matter a lot in who gets a true “education.” That said, I could’ve done without all the editorializing from the narrator/reporter. Bringing in a personal viewpoint muddies the societal trends the story examines. Four stars for me.

When the white male attorney took over, he loaded the charges immediately. His race and sex not highlighted in any way. Very inconsistent to the point that it is noticeable.

I don't agree with all of the view points expressed in the piece. I and my children are products of a city and rural public school system that was 50/50 in racial diversity. There were multiple examples of success across the board for all people. I'm not naive to think they came at the same experiences but the same level of public education was offered to all.

All the g00d nicknames taken	20201029T151451	3	Nice White Parents Review	Pros: The style of discussion is engaging and it is well researched. Tracing the history of one school district certainly allows one to see trends in behavior over time. This is a great in-depth examination. As someone who lives in a more rural area, learning about a city school system is fascinating since it is so different than how schools in my area are organized. Cons: Too often, the author tries to over-generalize, arguing that the problems of the NYC school system are problems everywhere with little proof. However, sometimes she does state the NYC is unique in being the most segregated school system in America (Ep 5), therefore occasionally demonstrating that some of these problems are unique to this type of school system. She leaves some threads unexplored; why is there a correlation between liberalism and segregation in schools? She mentions this, but only in passing. Like all podcasts, this one is biased towards the author's beliefs (everything is fault of nice white parents), but it does give a great window into the elite liberal view of public schools. Overall: The podcast was good for what it is - an examination of problems in one school system. It's overall applicability to the nation as a whole is limited, despite the author's best attempts to make it so. Fascinating entertainment, and worth discussing, but not profound - unless you're someone who is shocked that wealthy, liberal parents might try to stack the deck in favor of themselves.

I think though, that as an educated yet poor white male, I have a different takeaway from this research that makes me resent it in some ways. What I noticed is that there are different cultures that all have different beliefs for what was important, but I believe that many of the issues raised here were due to financial inequalities and not racial biases. Nobody in power listens to poor people because it seems as if they don't have power to give. That goes for all of us poor white families who live in these same neighborhoods that you talk about here. When a thousand rich families move to an area it sways everyone's access that isn't because of color but because of money. Am I wrong for seeing this in my own circumstances and relating it to this podcast?	So I really love these podcasts.

Anni Nish	20201001T151133	4	Timely Story And Well Written	This story is very timely and well written. I attended Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, VA in the late 80's when it was newly formed. Back then, it was fully diverse and well rounded. Recently it was noted that the incoming class for 2020 had virtually no blacks or Hispanics, so they too are considering moving to a lottery instead of test based where folks with more money can rig the system. In that case too, there is uproar but this time it's mostly from those Asians that have been grooming their children since pre-school to get in, getting them tutors, memorizing old tests, working with folks who know the key words/phrases to use in their applications. I'm an Asian myself, but I honestly believe, if you can't get in based on what you know without extra work, you shouldn't be there. It shouldn't just be because you have the resources to get in.

She tells the stories in such a way that it takes you on a roller coaster ride that in one moment has you in complete frustration and the next moment cheerleading. Thanks for the eye opening accounts and the brutal honesty of the system from all sides, it certainly needs much help.

JulliG	20200928T003119	5	Seasons 1-3 Were Great	I really love Sarah Koenig and the first several seasons. It was a bad choice to add the Nice White Parents podcast to the lineup. I found the information to be interesting but I didn't find it to be fairly assessed. For example, it seems to demonize the parents who wrote in support of integration but didn't send their kids to that school. There was no justification of the school not opening for 5 years after the letters were written or that these parents all seemed to be interested in giving their child the best education available while wanting to support integration. The last episode also talked a great deal about how nothing changes unless white parents raise the issue. While that may be true it may also be said that nothing changes unless the majority of people are concerned. As a white person I have no problem with bringing to light the dramatic injustices that have happened as a result of racial inequality. I just don't think this story was told fairly or without bias as I have come to expect from Serial. Still giving 5 stars though because the actual podcast is excellent and I support the risk that was taken to promote this series here.	I really love Sarah Koenig & the first several seasons.

Dino De La O	20200921T110614	5	All The 1 Starts Come From White Fragile Tears	I'm just going to reference one example because each of these 1 stars is just some variation of whiteness and fragility. This one star review said that if Hispanic and black kids were just taught to behave better, maybe the white mom wouldn't have felt unsafe for her kids. Maybe if the parents were just there enough, the kids would behave. Karen's mom probably has the time to start an entire middle school for Karen. Other moms are working 9-5 for minimum wage. Wealth and poverty are structural and inherited.	"I’m just going to reference one example because each of these 1 stars is just some variation of whiteness and fragility.

JudeandJess	20200915T150335	5	Uncomfortable	This subject makes a lot of people uncomfortable, including myself. The comments show people will run back to the same arguments over and over again, which is why this country is still where it is. The podcast is older so the term systemic racism isn't as popular yet. The message is clear. Children do not have equal opportunity. Parents that have time to petition or have their staff petition for their children, are not the norm. Children that misbehave one year should not suffer for the rest of their school career. The author is right, you can't measure nice! And you can't punish kids because both parents have to work or they can't afford a French tutor and so on. I would listen, with an open mind. Is it going to attack you personally? Yes. You'll be ok though. This author isn't solving anything but telling a story and an outcome, which we all can take lessons from. So get over yourself and grow.	"This subject makes a lot of people uncomfortable, including myself.

Soapjunkie67	20200919T205424	3	Not Objective	I love Serial but this season isn't objective. She lumps all white parents together in every school everywhere. She doesn't point out that she doesn't know how it is in California or Texas or New Mexico, etc. My kids went to public school for elementary, middle and high school. Everyone who lived in the area all went to the same school. It's not like they said whites go here, everyone else goes there. They all went together.	I love Serial but this season isn’t objective.

There's a lot of other factors in human behavior so looking at everything through such a narrow, race-colored lens is ridiculous and distorted. Thanks, but no thanks this season."

Another learning tool for white people, meaning me.

If you find yourself being defensive or offended by anything in this podcast, push through all 5 episodes and keep your mind open to these other points of view that are valid and valued.

The shrill and negative comments just show the fear we white people have of admitting our own privilege and that someday they could lose it. Anger as demonstrated in these reviews, is simply fear turned inside out. Thank you for bringing this subject to light and giving us parents more to process and a chance to keep working on exerting our privilege less and listening more.

We can all agree we don't want segregated schools. We don't want some kids getting a worse education than others. But when white kids/parents moved into this school and created diversity, and had a different way of doing things, they were admittedly unwanted. I agree the fundraising gala seemed extravagant but at the end of the day it raised money for the kids so who cares? Just because it's not the way you do things? Why is everyone so mad about what everyone else is doing? That parent (Rob I think was his name) had connections and know-how with fundraising and he brought the benefits to this school. What is the problem. Then the teacher you tried to paint as racist for sending her kids to a different school to get away from what she described as disruptive students. She said nothing of race. If the kids happened to be Latino or black, how is that her fault? Maybe if their parents taught them how to behave respectfully there wouldn't have been an issue. Then I thought I'd try to listen for 5 more minutes and you go into the ""gifted"" program. Oohhhh my god. You literally said the white kids are performing better than the other kids at the school. But then you imply that the gifted program is unfair because most of these kids are white and are there BECAUSE they're white. Do they get no credit for their merit? Why is this ongoing narrative so one-sided? WHY are the white kids doing better? Do they have better support in the home? Do their parents work more with them after school?

Why is it that the ones who constantly point out a person's race also happen to be those on the left?

The media continue their work to divide this country along racist lines. What happened to considering a person's character before their color? I predict it will soon backfire. Check out Freedom, Georgia to see how black people are segregating themselves from white people so they can feel ""safe"".

The problem is not white parents trying to help their children get the best education possible. Society should not shame any person for doing that. The problem is that the school systems and PTAs were not moored in any sort of collective vision for what their school should be and what their goals were. If there was a vision for the school and strong leadership, than new ideas from new people can be dispositioned appropriately. Halfway through the podcast I started asking myself if they chose the name Nice White Parents to get attention by throwing the race card. To me, it's so clear that all parents should do their best for their kids and it is the job of the school leadership to ensure consistency and equity across the student body. Why was that not clear to the authors and writers if this podcast?	Well done production, however the conclusion is wrong in my opinion.

plannernaner	20200827T212917	4	I'M With Laura	I would like to see the schools have enough money to have the same advantages across the board. One point, children who are disruptive in a classroom compromise the education of all students. As a parent, I wanted my kids in a classroom where learning could happen. So in my mind it does make a difference if a child does not cooperate with the learning environment. It also makes a difference if most of the students in a class are at a lower English reading level. It is unfair to a child who is a higher level, unless the class size is under 10 students. I also have seen that a household that has the time (and uses it) to help a child with homework at home allows a child to learn more in the classroom. That is something I think is directly related to a families income. If I'm working two jobs to sustain my lifestyle and my child is supervised by a non-English speaking grandparent, the child will almost always be at a disadvantage, no matter what money is spent at the school facility or by the school district for help for the child at school. Can you figure out a fix for that?	"I would like to see the schools have enough money to have the same advantages across the board.

garshnarwhal	20200829T142554	1	Biased	The first episode is irresponsible and I am not compelled to listen to the rest. The school was in danger of closing so they tried heavily to recruit more neighborhood kids to the school, which were well to do white kids. They were successful in large part due to one man taking an interest and organizing the community to enroll an influx of new kids. This man also raised tens of thousands of dollars for the school and started a French language immersion program with the principal's full blessing. Now the school is doing well and it is much more diverse. Diversity is supposed to be great for learning and creativity. Sounds great right? First of all, unless there is no choice, no one of any race wants their kid to be one of only a few in a race/class in a school. That is why, in fact, so many at the school were uncomfortable with the integration of whites into the school. But the reporter takes sides here. This reporter gives a megaphone to a few people in the school who are both resistant to change and power hungry. They are mad that many of the donations are made into a foundation that takes away their control of how to spend it and keeps the donor intent. They had no interest in fundraising to start with. Why don't they keep doing their lackluster job of raising funds since they were so happy with the $2k a year they were raising. They are also mad that the principal did not insist on a language immersion of languages many of the children already spoke. Let me ask you what would the kids be learning then? Why does the reporter talk to these couple people on the PTA so many times more than the other side? She is trying to justify their inflexibility and anger. But she does not succeed. Why would you assume that the non-white kids would not want to learn French or benefit from the programs and funds raised for the school by these white parents? Maybe this first generation of inflexible kids won't but I assure you the next set of classes would begin to matriculate in. Very shortsighted observations here. I am a liberal leaning person but I just can't see how the developments at this school can be seen as anything other than a good thing. Maybe not perfect, but certainly not deserving of a serial podcast to call them out as racists when they are trying their best to integrate and improve this school. They could have just left their kids in private school. I would love to see more schools in my area have so much community support and new ideas.

It's a deep dive into the politics of race and class that play out alongside bureaucracy and red tape in one Brooklyn public school. NWP does a great job of using this as a microcosm for the City as a whole, making reference to other schools along the way, examining the motivations of parents, school administrators and city bureaucrats in their decisions. I think if you listen to the first episode here and your reaction is ""ughhhh more about race and more ""anti-whiteness"" you're missing an important facet of functioning adulthood: the ability to engage in self-examination and the ability to consider the perspectives of people who are different from you. This podcast isn't about ""white guilt"" it's about acknowledging that many of the systems we rely on to help create equity in this country (education) are plagued by the same institutionalized racism that prevents them from effectively doing so. In order for meaningful equity to be created we (white people) have to be more self-reflective and deliberate in our decisions and actions, however well-intentioned. We need to act like, as Glennon Doyle would say, ""there's no such thing as other people's children."" Ignore the trolls who've posted negative reviews. Open your mind and just LISTEN."

Hours of content geared towards using pushing narrative based on opinions and no fact checking on their part. A sad day to know things changed as NYT bought them out. Sorry to say, my experience with this podcast ends today. To long Serial.	It’s a sad day when you see creative people turn towards racism and identity politics.

Rage 2010	20200822T130216	3	The Title Does Not Lie - Race, Race, Race.	According to the podcast, white people are racist when they segregate, when they de facto segregate, when they attempt to integrate, AND when they actually integrate. They're racist whenever they try to put their kids in a good program or when they insist on a better program where they are. There is absolutely value in a race discussion, but it is definitely not the whole story. I gravitate to the explanation that the greatest divide between inner city race issues occurs at the level of culture and values.

M. Gonzalez	20200821T223300	5	Very Interesting	It's great to be able to learn a little bit of the school segregation situation in other places. So far I'm in chapter one and it got my attention I listen to all the episodes. I do have a comment though about the fact that this is a international studies school however there was not much of that even though there is a high percentage of Hispanic students and about a 10% of Arabic students. Well now with the new parents and their ideas and interest things have shifted in the direction they need. And she mentions how now the French program is valuable because the new parents care for it and Spanish or Arabic is not and was not even in the curriculum. I see that particular part of the situation as lack of interest or maybe lack of knowledge from the parents of said Hispanic and Arabic students and their principal. I wonder if they ever thought about that? If the idea was thrown around? If anybody cared for the addition of international languages or program to the school curriculum. Hopefully there's some info. on this in future episodes.	"It’s great to be able to learn a little bit of the school segregation situation in other places.

My children went to a progressive private school starting in the late 90's. The changes in the demographic ramped up around 9/11. The rich entitled class were everywhere; not just the Upper East Side. We felt that we were doing ok hovering in the middle class along with other artistic types like us in The East and West Village who were fortunate to be able to send our children to these schools, which were not the price of some colleges as they are now. The parents that started moving into the downtown schools changed the fabric and feel to the extreme. The attitude and entitlement felt alienating. My daughter went to middle school in Carol Gardens. The demographic there has totally shifted. I empathize deeply with the parents from the PTA. Maybe I will push myself to listen past Episode 1 if I can stop being revolted at the francophile parents in this story.	"I listened to first episode and it was really good, but triggering!

AOS_Nick	20200729T022956	5	Nice White Parents?	I can't believe people are unsubscribing because you feel white people are being blamed for everything. The journalists are stating facts that show social injustice. As a white male in Ohio, it is truly eye opening that these things are really happening. The black defendants are not being portrayed as perfect citizens in the podcast so I don't view this as white vs black. It's raising much needed awareness to social injustice. Most of the defendants do break laws but most people living in poverty have this struggle. I have seen many white friends go down similar sinking holes for something as minor of unpaid child support. It does become a snow ball effect. NO human being deserves to be beaten, harassed, and abused for any reason and especially by people that are supposed to serve and protect.

I understand journalists WANT to interject their own opinions and ideologies, but they shouldn't. You made it political when it didn't have to be, simply because ""racial division"" is the hot button word right now. It's not a black issue. It's not a white issue. It's a class issue, poverty equals higher crime, and it's being propagated by bad policy in inner cities that have been run under the same suppositions for 50 years. It isn't working, and to just fall back on racism isn't the answer. You lost a listener, because I can't handle the social justice tag lines in every other statement."

After flipping sides and going after the white collar bad guys I have seen both sides of this equation. Serial nails it perfectly. For those reviewers that see this as a political statement and give the podcast a low rating because it attacks white people I can state unequivocally that the facts presented in this podcast are truly how the system works. It is not a political statement but an eye opening look at reality for those that have never lived it firsthand.	I spent the first several years of my career as a criminal defense lawyer.

Season three is a close second, and season two is just...different. Still worth the listen though.

It was amazing story telling and followed a great outline. However I think season 2 was a big swing and miss. Its not much of a mystery when compared to season 1 and much more repetitive. Although Im fascinated with the military involvement in the middle east its not much of a mystery. Hopefully season 3 will be a return to a murder mystert/cold case and not a recap of a missing soldier like season 2. Hard pass on the white guilt trip new season.

He was shooting randomly in the street and that's what happens when you take a gun to a street and start shooting. I'm sorry but violent criminals like that should be locked up for life.

Daughter of Bob	20200712T193053	5	About Three	"This should be required listening for anyone who wants to know why police brutality is unsolvable without deep and irreversible change. What I would have like to have seen more of is why the police are encouraged to terrorize and penalize and traumatize black and brown people, particularly males, and the larger system that serves, the law and order political slogans that elevates and how that makes us ALL less free. I would also have like to hear just one of these habitually violent officers explain what goes through their head when they operate as this gestapo, and how it leaks into the rest of their lives because you can't tell me these are gentle and i traumatized human beings with their families. Violence hurts the victim and the perpetrator and so the closed ranks of blue hide and sanctify just as much traumatized and unhealed rage behavior and toxic masculinity as any gang or organized crime family does. This is all about the politics of pain and whose pain is ""heroic"" and in the service of ""society"" and whose pain is ""anti social"" and ""barbaric"". Finally it's about whose pain is the most lucrative for the state and the prison industrial complex of civil rights stripped free labor answers that question handily. Finally, I truly appreciate the way you have listened to people whose way of expressing themselves has too often been dismissed on its face with no further nuance or attempts at comprehension. This I found deeply moving and respectful when no other system in our country provides a similar outlet for truths that deserve to be heard."

I'll need to do some research on my own but don't let that stop you. Give them a listen. It is time we'll spent.

Ohio, Cleveland especially... is broken. I spent my college days researching this very issue. And I found myself in a vicious circle. There were so many problems, so little time and so so much on the line. How do we fix it? I could not answer this question- it still keeps me up at night. But this podcast gave me a sense of peace. Knowledge that I'm not the only one so saddened by our justice system. But this is the only way we start to heal a broken system. With words and conversations and open hearts and minds- by acknowledging the small cases. The ones that the media doesn't cover. So thank you. Know that you are my hero. You are doing work that is not rewarding, it comes with no glory or thanks. I know how this weighs heavily on your soul. How it changes you in ways you can't explain. How easy it is to give up.

Joshuhlc	20200430T055932	4	First Two Seasons Were Great. Third Showed A Lot Of Bias.	The first season was great! I couldn't stop listening to it. The second season was good but a different flavor. The third season was just ok. She really seemed to favor the criminals over the police. This is fine for a personal opinion, but when it comes to interviewing them she was clearly biased. She would press the police and government officials really hard when she talked to them, but when she interviewed the criminals you could hear the sympathy in her voice. She didn't push them for the truth or for any real answers. She also didn't show any real sympathy for the victims of their crimes. It's ok to take a side in the debate, but if you're going to do a podcast at least push both sides equally as hard for the truth. But then again maybe she just acted that way for her own safety with the criminals.	The first season was great! I couldn’t stop listening to it. The second season was good but a different flavor.

But I listened and I analyzed. I won't share my opinion about Adnan, but he is definitely unique! The case is fascinating. I don't think his friend was lying! And that's all I have to say.

However, the second season is where I stopped listening after the host called the Taliban and discussed terrorist activity and operations against US soldiers as nothing unusual nor disgusting. The extremely unpatriotic and anti-law enforcement sentiment was a bit too much for me.	I loved the first season. Very interesting and well-rounded analysis of the Syed case.

MontRich	20200422T154028	5	Great Podcast	I disagree a lot with the narrative of season 3 but appreciate the dialogue. Good work exposing a failing and unpleasant issue in our society. I find it interesting that this very broken system is almost completely run by the government... (I will acknowledge there are some for profit prisons). It's a very real example of why the government can't be trusted. It's also interesting that the biggest offenders across America are the democrat strong holds...... The biggest bombshell to me of the whole season was where she admitted to letting the individuals she interviewed use her for almost unlimited free phone calls to their friends and family. It muddied the water badly for me.	I disagree a lot with the narrative of season 3 but appreciate the dialogue. Good work exposing a failing and unpleasant issue in our society.

E.MADare	20200417T072728	5	Someone Finally Reporting The Truth!	So important to do the unpopular thing and expose how broken our justice system is! To the people who are offended, listen to wrongful convictions podcasts, read about the innocence projects, when you see how far off the system is with life top cases, why would they do any better with the rest of the lesser cases. In my county there are many accused held at unconstitutionally high bails for over 5 years waiting for a trial. Yes you have the right to a speedy trial, as long as you want to lose. There is no right to a speedy effective defense. As long as the prosecutors are rewarded for winning they will never be interested in the truth. It's all an interesting story to be argued over until someone you love is falsely accused and gets caught in the system. The justice system is an oxymoron. Anyone who still thinks it is fair believes in fairy tails. Thank you Sarah. Keep up the good work. All three seasons are the best podcasts ever done!

I especially enjoyed Season 2, because I'd been wondering what ever happened with Beau Bergdahl's case. And Season 3 was an eye-opening look inside a broken system. It showed a horrifying side of the Juvenile Justice system that I previously had no idea about. While some may complain that these stories aren't ""objective,"" maintaining ""objectivity"" instead of showing compassion when our fellow humans are being treated inhumanely is not a virtue. A good narrator knows that we can't help but change stories merely by investigating and reporting in them as they unfold. This narrator tells spellbinding stories, and her personal involvement only enriches them. Please make another season soon!"

SeaDadE12	20200409T071546	1	Grasping For Straws	We almost didn't make it through two episodes of season one; we stopped listening after that. It sounded like none of the individuals who were interviewed, including the convicted killer, had any interest in the case at all. The questions were always leading, the interviews always sounded forced. It's also very curious that at least two of the individuals interviewed have book deals. The whole thing was just boring. Anyone who says this is a riveting story, or that the narration was great, obviously has not seen a Dateline NBC with Keith Morrison. Serial's host/narrator was not good, at all. I know it's not the popular thing, but sometimes it's okay to trust that everyone involved in the justice system (detectives, prosecution, judges, etc.) actually know how to do their jobs and do them well. In this case, as with the Making a Murderer case, justice was served.	We almost didn’t make it through two episodes of season one; we stopped listening after that.

A lot of people say it's a one sided story; well it is when she can only get first hand information from one side of the story. She does a good job of laying all the information on the table before conclusions are made. Very much enjoyed binging all three seasons in 3 weeks!

I've encountered so many people who were obviously not guilty but felt they had to plead guilty because of stacked charges. In Virginia, the prosecutor's offices are ""paid"" by the state for every conviction they get, hence they don't dismiss charges but bargain on the sentence. Who is willing to risk 80 years when they can plead guilty and get 3-6 months and two years probation. It's an incredibly corrupt way to do justice and it's a conflict of interest to boot.

Currently on season 2 and I used to listen around the kids but with so many choice words I can't! Not a fan of how it's no longer family friendly.	The first season with Adnan is what got me hooked!

Beyond stupid to spend so much effort explaining and defending the reasons an idiotic young man with psychological issues, deserts his post after a couple of months of deployment. And she spends more than an entire episode claiming no one died searching for him and making whataboutisms.	Sarah argues that Bergdahl’s actions are ‘understandable’ from...Bergdahl’s point of view.

Only to have to research myself what actually happened in the appeals case... intriguing and captivating, but lackluster ending. If you're going to spend over a year investigating a case and cover any of the trail, shouldn't the end and judgement be the most important?

It took a year to make and the diligence with which it was researched shows through in every episode. The reporters present all sides with fairness and humanity. It has no political agenda. It offers no easy solutions. But it does shine a light on a broken system in which the concept of justice is too often forgotten.	This podcast revives the craft of great investigative journalism.

I loved the way Sarah told the stories and I got through the first two seasons pretty quick. Then I started the third season and got to episode 5 then had to turn it off because my blood was boiling. I couldn't believe what I was hearing as I listened to snarky anti police comment after snarky anti police comment. I'm furious at the way Sarah is bashing the police and making the entire season so incredibly bias. These men and women walk out the door for work EVERY single day or night not knowing if they will make it home. Their families worry and have knots in their stomachs until their LEO gets home from their shift. Are there bad police officers out there? OF COURSE. But they are the exception not the majority and if the police stop you and you reach for a gun, you're going to be shot. I will support that choice EVERY time because when that officer puts his life on the line to protect the entire city he shouldn't have to be put through hell for deciding to save the life of his fellow officers and of himself when a suspect pulls a gun. I will NEVER support this podcast again.	As soon as I started the first episode of season 1 I was hooked! I loved the way Sarah told the stories and I got through the first two seasons pretty quick.

liefdemegan	20200113T020611	5	Surprised To See Low Rated Reviews	Initially upon listening to a few episodes after binging on a number of true crime podcasts, I may have judged prematurely. I was afraid that her matter-of-factly type approach would get very boring. I'm really glad I stuck it out. I listened to all 3 seasons objectively and put together my review carefully. This podcast is not like the others, Sarah Koenig has a very thorough methodology when she interviews all persons - whether behind bars or high power judicial figures. She is highly intelligent which is conveyed with her eloquence and I believe she offers the listeners a non bias approach. In season 1, she is very back and forth with her opinion on Adnan as more evidence becomes available. She's not afraid to submerge herself into the case in order to provide as many facts as she can. I really appreciated this podcast and hope to hear of a season 4 soon.	Initially upon listening to a few episodes after binging on a number of true crime podcasts, I may have judged prematurely.

Oyvyhurri	20200108T215230	1	Unfortunate And Blind	"The story is presented as if Adnan is innocent, but ignores a lot of key information and statements. For example: he talked about how he wishes someone had caught him strangling her. He wishes that what he did was something someone had seen. The way he makes these statements is not at all normal, and he doesn't do it once or twice. He does it over and over. This is a very biased podcast, which is tragic. Also, ""quote, unquote"" gets very old very fast."	"The story is presented as if Adnan is innocent, but ignores a lot of key information and statements.

What it did do was humanize the injustice and those facing it. I have worked as a public defender, and whenever I discuss these injustices with people they always say who cares, these people broke the law and they deserve this. This season, in my opinion did a great job of combating that. This season took that ""criminal"" who does not deserve justice and gives them a name, a voice, and a platform to share their story.

The journalists herself is a great narrator and makes it so interesting and easy to follow. For people saying she is being bias and not holding the ""criminals"" accountable must live in a bubble. I say this because many reviews put their two cents about law and racial discrimination, how they suggest maybe just moving neighbors instead of repeating crimes and dealing with the abuse. LET ME TELL YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ""growing up in south central los angeles"" (to most known for having a high percentage of mostly African Americans, gang bangers, drug addicts and really high crime rates to say the east) Anyways, plain and simple IS NOT EASY TO JUST PICK UP AND LEAVE. Most people living in these areas dont have the money, help, or opportunities to do so. This is one of the reason that law enforcement takes advantage. The statistics show that once a person is input into the criminal system is so much easier for them to fall back in for longer terms each time. The streets, system and lack of opportunities for many people living in these areas is like a game and only a few ""win""( in other words get out if the hood). Many people that listen to these podcast are not aware of this simply because they were a lot more fortunate and had better opportunities. Trust me is easy to judge when you have not lived or experienced many of the things that this podcast brings up. I really enjoyed listening to it."

LET ME TELL YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE “growing up in south central los angeles” (to most known for having a high percentage of mostly African Americans, gang bangers, drug addicts and really high crime rates to say the east) 
Anyways, plain and simple IS NOT EASY TO JUST PICK UP AND LEAVE. Most people living in these areas dont have the money, help, or opportunities to do so. This is one of the reason that law enforcement takes advantage. The statistics show that once a person is input into the criminal system is so much easier for them to fall back in for longer terms each time. The streets, system and lack of opportunities for many people living in these areas is like a game and only a few “win”( in other words get out if the hood). 
Many people that listen to these podcast are not aware of this simply because they were a lot more fortunate and had better opportunities. Trust me is easy to judge when you have not lived or experienced many of the things that this podcast brings up. 
I really enjoyed listening to it."

Norrisjt	20191104T201552	1	I Just Can'T Listen Any More	Every episode is full of criminals. They have no regard for the law. Drugs, fighting and so on. It never ends. I get the abuse by law enforcement is wrong and needs to be stopped. I would move out of the city if I kept getting harassed. I wouldn't be aging street parties smoking weed and driving around with alcohol. Plus no license. Report where there is a problem not where the criminals keep breaking the law!

My issue was mainly with the tone Sarah has at times - she comes off so naive or almost ignorant of racial and social inequality and injustices in our society. Maybe I would like it better if her interviews and conversations didn't include her reactions - if she were more unbiased or objective. There were several times I felt myself getting exasperated that she was surprised that black and brown and poor people are treated differently in our society... Given that I don't know her background, maybe she is actually surprised.

cmjonas	20191011T191023	2	Good Start, Bad Season 3	I really enjoyed the first two seasons however I stopped listening to season 3 after the first couple episodes. It made me cringe listening to all of these criminals speak and act like they are the victims, ESPECIALLY the ones who are in and out of court on a consistent basis. You aren't a good person if you abuse government funding, have too many kids you can't support who end up going into the system, have a drug problem and constantly cry for help but refuse to help yourself and commit crimes and end up in jail repeatedly. Sarah trying to defend them and blame the justice system is absolutely appalling, I agree that not every government official is fair and there are some corrupt people but nothing I heard in the episodes I listened to made me believe those particular officials are corrupt, clearly those people are criminals.

Sarah Koenig very clearly only talked with a prosecutor briefly, and focused on the defense side - which is FINE, that's what I knew I was getting into. But to call for ""prosecutors to stop loading up indictments with everything possible"" isn't fair or accurate, or unbiased. The last episode was the hardest for me personally to listen to because it was the most unfair representation of criminal justice out of them all.

I also really enjoyed season three. It highlights the fact that racism is alive, and well. How young black men are stuck in this vicious cycle that they were born into. And boy howdy, I wanted to slap the teeth off that one judge. He has no business stepping foot into a courthouse, let alone being a judge. I digress, though. I hope there's a season four. I have much respect for Sarah, and her team.	I came across this podcast not too long ago. I’m sort of a late bloomer in the podcast world.

fisherrd	20190912T011853	3	Downhill Quality	The first season was amazing. The second season was pretty good. The third season has got to be among some of the worst podcast episodes I've ever heard. The reporter completely lacks objectivity and continues to bash the police and pull the racism card until the very last episode. She quickly discards any other alternative. Let's hope she does better next season.	The first season was amazing. The second season was pretty good. The third season has got to be among some of the worst podcast episodes I’ve ever heard.

SerialPodcastReviewer	20190906T222042	3	Season By Season Breakdown.	Season 1: Five Stars The best podcast season I have ever heard, absolutely amazing. The way the season grips you and draws you in is unlike any other podcast I've ever found. Unlike many podcasts that simply tell a story that has been researched, this one investigates and researches on tape. Totally fascinating and unforgettable. I also love how Sarah keeps an open mind throughout. Season 2: Two Stars The second season is quite poor. Unlike the first season which keeps you listening, season 2 has the listener torturously forcing themselves through the season that has none of the things that made the first season great. Season 3: One Star Though season 2 is dull, it is not as bad as the third season. Season 3 is just plain old bad. Instead of keeping an open mind and showing both sides like she did in the first season, all Sarah does is try to say how bad the police and the criminal justice system are. The arguments are not fact based and are simply bad. The lies and bias are so thick it makes it impossible to consider this season anything more than another leftist propaganda outlet. Sarah only believes the people who are on trial and never, ever believes the police. She cynically says that racial bias is to blame for everything. Even when people are making totally reasonable arguments, if it cuts against the narrative and makes the law enforcement look like the good guys, Sarah somehow finds a way to make them out to be evil. Third season is not worth anyone's time.	"Season 1: Five Stars

SK was so good and she kept her mind open but pressed for the truth. Season 2 was less impressive. I missed SK doing the interviews and it felt she was detached. Didn't love the season but it is hard to avoid a sophomore slump after season 1. Season 3 was just awful. Huckster journalism driven by personal agenda, cop bashing and race baiting. If SK could have maintained a professional detachment like she did in season 1 she could have done great things with this idea but she was so incredibly biased it was hard to listen to- I kept wanting to tell her to muzzle her opinion and just give me all the facts... aggravating.

Then they made a fatal flaw of taking too long to come out with a new season and further degraded the premise that the audience should make up their own minds with a political propaganda piece.

Sure I don't agree with Sarah's opinions (I.e. 10 years is long enough for murder) but I am a liberal who believes most police are protecting us however there are bad eggs who give them all a bad name.

I feel empowered to share my stories now and feel like I will be believed thanks to this series. This staff is my journalism hero’s with true integrity.

A Happy Listenee	20190807T174924	5	Amazing Podcast	Just finished Season 3 with tears in my eyes. Sarah Koenig and everyone on the team at Serial is doing vital, important work with the eye of an anthropologist. She does the difficult work of finding the facts on every side of the situation and allowing her listener to come to their own conclusions before she gives them her own take. The most amazing part of the show is the connections that Sarah can make with people that come from such different backgrounds than her own. I can't wait to hear more. I would love to hear a season on the immigration system. I'm looking forward to hearing more from Emmanuel as well. Thank you, Serial, for everything you do!

No matter how serious the crime, there is a litany of excuses why it was OK and the system is evil for making them face the consequences of their actions.	Season 1 is solid, season 3 is very biased.

I still follow this case with Google alerts and other podcasts today. Season 3 was good to bring things to light that far too often continue to happen in our justice system. While the season was good, the stories just made me mad. I know the justice system sees alot of mess but aren't we all still human beings who deserve a fair day in court?! Season 1 and Season 3 are must-listen to podcasts!	Serial Season 1 still has me hooked! This was an absolutely great podcast with excellent story telling all along the way.

I loved the deep dive into the details of one specific case each season, but season 3 was very differently formatted.. by having a new case each week, I didn't get the same details or the same feeling of notoriety as previously.

lilhippyrealtrippy	20190731T180247	5	Insightful Gripping Poscast	"Serial is a great podcast that gives you an in-depth analysis of each case season 1-3. Season 2 was my least favorite. Initially I was thrown off by season 3's structure as some other reviewers were. However I gave it a try. It's extremely insightful, giving us an upfront dive into our judicial system and it's flawed construct. People should look at it objectively. Some things I agree with, some things I don't but I think the reporting is objective not pandering. It seems pandering for people who don't want to see the reality that sometimes the judicial system fails to administer justice fairly without bias no matter the race or if a person has a badge. Saying she's siding with ""the streets"" is so condescending and teetering on prejudice. Not everyone prosecuted from ""the streets"" is guilty and that's the point she's trying to make. Just because a court gives a sentence doesn't make it outright impartial justice even though it should be. There's some defendants on here that sound arrogant and the same can be said for the cops and prosecutors interviewed as well. The justice system should be equal parts punishment and rehabilitation. Currently rehabilitation, in my opinion, isn't as much an option for courts as condemnation and punishment. What she's doing is showing the humanity in demographics where people assume have none just because of their race or where they come from. Give the stories a chance and have an open mind. It won't hurt to try because obviously what we've been doing for decades hasn't healed the nation or benefited everyone fairly. Change is the only option left."

Matthew Blaine	20190731T154038	1	Don'T Bother With Season 4	This podcast has gone completely off the rails. Every episode is about the suspect is innocent and the cops/justice system is wrong. She literally paints convicted criminals, who admit they're in gangs, doing drugs, etc....and tries to paint them as angels. Blames everything in the system and racism. Don't j silt the profession by calling her journalist, because she isn't.	This podcast has gone completely off the rails.

(I swear if I hear that phrase one more time I will loose my mind) Good journalism is non biased. The journalist leaves their own opinions out of it. They look for facts, they look for the truth and they desire to do good and help benefit the people they're researching. Sarah is not a good journalist. Her tone says ""My opinion is right, I'll agree to disagree but I'm obviously right and very much judging you for your choices"". It's offensive, and downright annoying. Her snooty know it all attitude made me finally quit listening out of rage halfway through season 3. She's pushy and rude to those she interviews and has NO respect for them, their lives or their stories. Her only motive is her selfish desire to uncover the juiciest details and make a good story for podcast. It's evident that she's not doing this for the people she's interviewing/ researching but only for herself. I have no idea what Brit and Ash heard when they listened to this podcast because I expected so much more from Serial and was disappointed and disgusted from what I heard. Don't waste your time."

He worked with the innocent project and they pushed hard, but sadly nothing came from the help they gave. Season 3 made me furious at what happens on the daily in our criminal justice system. My family and I (hard working Texans) watched as our family member was railroad all for the sake of justice. To hear how these judges spoke to people (humans.. yes they committed crimes) but to talk to people with such hate saddens me. We have forgotten about innocent until proven guilty. Thank you for opening your heart and spending so much time telling the truth and showing your listeners how it is... Color, money and who your family is plays a big role in sentencing. You spoke to these ""hardened criminals"" like they were people who mattered. The respect and love you showed them made me tear up while listening! I am blown away!

Springrhapsody22	20190715T200350	2	Skip After Season One	I was never a podcast listener until someone turned me on to serial and absolutely loved season one. Season two was pretty interesting until around the middle where her opinions started to show more and more each episode. It is no longer a unbiased podcast - I enjoyed this because it was fact driven not because I want to listen about someone else's opinions. Completely disappointed on the political agenda she is now reporting, she also is clearly emotionally inserting her feelings into the podcast. I won't even listen to season three because of the way she ended season two.	I was never a podcast listener until someone turned me on to serial and absolutely loved season one.

The political agenda is evident, and while I agree the criminal justice system has many problems that need to be critically looked it, it vilifies both police and lawyers (prosecutors and defenders). A more objective view would make this podcast far more enjoyable. Overall I would not recommend this show anymore, maybe I'll try again next season.

Season 3 is incredibly biased. A criminal is a criminal. There are far more upstanding cops and judges than bad ones.	Season 1 was good.

Season 3 episodes 1 -9 I'll not micro analyze each and every instance where your leftist, liberal agenda in reporting what you see is the problem with our justice system. Let's just say that surely you realize that the root problem is people not obeying the law. It is not society or law enforcement job to hold the hand of criminals through their judicial venture and making sure that they are not offended, scared or disapproving of the system. I feel sorry for law enforcement for constantly having to look over their shoulders to make sure that they do not offend someone while having to account for their behavior. Such slanted reporting on your part only makes matter worst.	"Enjoy your podcast overall. However, there is a tremendous bias on some episodes, I.E. Season 3 episodes 1 -9

Stayed up all night, in fact. S1 was amazing of course but I haven't stopped wrestling with my own opinions on it. I did not finish S2, I will admit. S3 is something we need 100 more times - we have so much work to do and awareness to raise!	Wish we had nonstop content and reporters of this caliber.

gsilia	20190628T193930	3	Somewhat Biased	"Ok season 3, and so far and I was enjoying the podcast. It became very clear after a while, that they were making excuses for ""Jesse"". It's obvious that he is a habitual offender who is clearly trying to take advantage of the justice system. He was very much provoking the police officers. There are many black people who face adversities and don't behave that way. With that, I started to loose interest when the episodes attempted to find excuses for his behaviors. Not only was he provoking officers he committed other criminal acts repeatedly."	"Ok season 3, and so far & I was enjoying the podcast.

I loved it so much that I got my mom hooked as well. I was really impressed by Sarah's thorough explanations of each possible perspective. She left me completely unsure of who really did it, but also extremely educated on all of the possibilities. I was just as confused when i started listening to episode 1-but in a good way! Season 2 was not that interesting to me, but it could just be my personal preference. However, season 3 was so amazing that I kept the 5 star rating! I love all of the different cases explained, but that when certain cases required more than one episode, such as Joshua's case, the podcast did so. The season educated me on truly how unjust the justice system is, and how it doesn't really benefit many beyond those at the top and those in positions of privilege. It was definitely a rude awakening, but I feel as though I can now look at headlines and cases I see on the news from a more objective and understanding perspective. I'm anxiously awaiting season 4 and am super excited to see what it will be about!	Serial consistently remains one of my favorite podcasts!

I think there are so many county's in this country that need this type of investigative reporting (lawrenceburg IN) for a example in my opinion. Once again highly recommended!

People have to be accountable for their behaviors, along with communities, legal profession and government. There is no accounting for community in season 3, just placing blame strictly on prejudice. Time for the ""investigator"", to read more about crime statistics and race. May I suggest Heather MacDonald's work."	Liked season 1, lost me at season 2, he committed treason.

I'm also excited to learn that this case is back in the popular culture and it looks like Adnan Syed is getting another shot at seeing his case re-tried. I really wanted to like season 2, but the combination of it being a topic I'm really, really not interested in and the storytelling just not grabbing me led me to quit listening halfway through. I haven't had the chance to check out season 3 yet, but if I hear good things maybe I'll give it a listen.	Like a ton of listeners, I binged straight through season 1 after it came out and loved it.

Syberella	20190609T062836	1	Biased	First and foremost, Sarah is a storyteller. She is not a crime journalist, nor is she an investigator. However, to exclude all of the facts that clear Adnon's name is atrocious. There are several inconsistencies that this series fails to point out. Although it did a good job setting the scene of the case, it was not a fair review of the case and it caused several to believe he was guilty because of skewed evidence.

Criminal justice needs a drugs overhaul. The system seems set up to keep those in it once they are in it. The youthful offenders in particular seemed to not stand a chance. Piling suspended license upon suspended license so these kids can't ever pay the fine only perpetuates the problem. This was a much needed light on a problem many of us don't know about or thin about bc we are not involved. Well done storytelling.

What's Nathan Doing?	20190509T174210	4	Season One Is Good	I was recommended this podcast from a friend. Season one follows one case and gives an unbiased discussion of the events in the case. It was interesting and informative. The discussion goes from he is innocent to guilty to not sure. Season 2 was okay. I couldn't connect with it and it was boring at times. It didn't have the hook that season one had and didn't follow the style that season one had. It gets point for not trying to copy season one but ultimately not a recommendation. Season three tackles the criminal justice in one city. It jumps around a little with the cases but does not have the personal touch that seasons one did. It was interesting to see the workings of the criminal justice system behind the scenes. It is better than season 2.	"I was recommended this podcast from a friend.

But overall it is thought provoking, no matter what side you are on. It takes a closer look from many angles to have you the listener come up with your own opinion. I was worried about how CLE would be portrayed, but the stats are the same everywhere. CLE is not better or worse. Listen when you can, think for yourself and try to understand what it would be like in someone else's life. Great listen.

Goldie1201	20190528T044154	2	Deteriorating	Season 1: Interesting with the feeling that there was an attempt at genuine impartiality in order to determine facts of the situation and a look at both sides. Generally I feel this is due to being indecisive about the situation and, therefore, couldn't proceed from a biased standpoint. Season 2: I couldn't stomach this right now. As the spouse of a medically retired Veteran, I just couldn't. Perhaps I will try again in the future. Season 3: Biased. I stopped at the point where she was trying to advocate for one side of a story to be taken seriously while scoffing at another person's concerns only moments earlier. Disappointing. A genuine look does need to be taken where our justice system is concerned, but proceeding from a confirmation bias standpoint will not get us there.

Why did Adnan leave his car with Jay that day? If Jay was behind the murder, why would Adnan roam with Jay and appear at Cathy's home that evening? It looks suspicious.	Sarah narrates it brilliantly.

tiffanywifemomboss	20190519T174254	5	Must Listen!	I absolutely love this podcast! I have listened to all of season 1 and 2 and it's absolutely remarkable to hear the things they uncover and discover as journalists. I feel the need to remark on some negative reviews. It's not supposed to have an ending, it's real life and they are giving you all the info for YOU to make a decision for yourself, which is still difficult. That's the point I think though, to make us THINK, not just make a decision about something going on in our society, it's deeper than that. I love the narrator, can't wait to hear more!

ABRobb	20190517T140510	1	Very Hard To Pay Attention	I often heard other true crime podcasts recommend Serial so I put it in my queue. Boy was season 1 torturous. There was to much of the narrating repeating what others said verus recordings of what they said so most of every episode was pretty much exclusively the narrator speaking. It was hard to connect on a personal level to follow the story and find out the truth. It wasn't very engaging. I got 2 episodes into Season 2 and realized I didn't want to waste my time or energy trying to follow the stories. Not even going to give Season 3 a chance.

Who cares how he says things; words aren't always the measure of a persons beliefs or intent. Words are sometimes a ways to relate. If he didn't care, he'd lock em all away.

PDPiper	20190412T150133	1	Increasingly Worse Each Season!	I first came upon this podcast during season 1. I was fascinated with it like one is compelled to look at the aftermath of a bad wreck on the highway. As much as we try to look straight ahead we find ourselves looking out of the corner of our eye. However as the season continued I became very aware of what I am presuming is Ms. Koenig's blissful ignorance to her own biasses. Listening to her take the word of anyone that bolstered her views on the particular matter at hand while completely ignoring the other side has become laughable. Now in season 3 Me. Koenig has become a caricature of herself. Sadly as much as I found some entertainment value in the podcast, usually in the form of laughing at the blatant ignorance being broadcast, I can no longer partake as I now just find it to be repetitive and boring. Listening to Ms. Koenig cajole her targets is like listening to an enabling parent coddle a child. To the uninformed I can see why this podcast remains entertaining, and I don't have issue with that. As for me I have grown tiresome of the infantile views presented and have listened to my last episode.	"I first came upon this podcast during season 1.

Jennypismo	20190405T233018	4	I Watched The Hbo Special 1St; The Podcast Is Better.	I think the fact of Sarah goes back-and-forth on whether she thinks Adnan committed the murder is a sign that he might not be Innocent however in a court of law I agree he should've been acquitted there was not enough evidence to prove him a murderer. My one main problem is that he can't remember what he did that day when that day was one of his best friends birthdays. Isn't that her point. Stephanie's birthday should make that a memorable day for Adnan. Season 2 taught me a lot about the Middle East and war and was insightful to the way people believe and think. Season 3 was huge with its simple final message that jail should be more strict to function sentences should be less long charges should be less piled on and staff should be less overloaded. And that people who cooperate deserve some sort of benefit of protection at the least.

groundbeef96	20190325T031605	2	Eh But Also Kind Of Good... (Season 1 Review)	"Listened to this when it first came out and loved it, completely agreed with her points and believed that adnad was innocent. Recently I got back into it (season 1) and started to pick apart the flaws in his story. I did some research and the state DID have a decent case against adnad. One of the most confusing things about him, and what really makes me side with jay, is that HE CANNOT REMEMBER ANYTHING. He doesn't even try making anything up, he just says ""I don't know"" or ""I probably did this."" I understand not remembering specific details, but at least when jay told his side of the story (and yes I understand that jays story has some holes in it and he can seem to be unreliable at some points) he gives a story! I understand why adnad was convicted. Also Sarah is VERY biased throughout the first season. Not going to lie though I have re-listened to this podcast many times. She is a very good journalist, but I think that she didn't take the right stance on this case. She should have gone into without a bias and explained both sides of the story before giving her opinion (that's what I would have liked to hear). She makes herself seem so unbiased in the beginning, but it's obvious by the second episode whose side she's on. Another thing that really annoyed me was that she downplays how ""obsessed"" adnad was with hae- and how controlling he could be. She completely brushes it off! Even when literally reading evidence of it! Anyways if you have gotten this far, I recommend you listen to the first season and form your own opinion. Do some research or, if you're a nerd like me, look up the trial transcripts. But PLEASE, whatever you do, don't form your opinion solely on this podcast because trust me with one google search you can find many flaws with what some of the things Sarah is saying. But overall it's not a bad listen, again she is a great journalist."	Listened to this when it first came out and loved it, completely agreed with her points and believed that adnad was innocent.

For those of you who think this podcast is one sided and or makes the police sound like a gang you're ignorant. Theres way too much in not only Adnans case but many others cases. Not to mention Bmore police were UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. And don't forget one of the detectives in Adnans case was so un-credible he was not called to the stand. It's sad people can't look past Adnan or people like Freddie Gray just to name a few, and look at the police departments involved in their cases.

I'm a documentary nut and I waste more time researching history and things like this, that I care to mention. But, I cannot say enough on not only how soothing her presence is on this, but that she is bringing up every question that comes to mind during each episode. It's almost as though she is hearing me ask ""but what about this"" , ""why that"".... I applaud this in so many ways and this has created a new world for me. I only hope that whatever I decide to move on to after this, will be able to hold even the slightest candle to what is provided in this.

It’s almost as though she is hearing me ask “but what about this” , “why that”.... I applaud this in so many ways and this has created a new world for me. I only hope that whatever I decide to move on to after this, will be able to hold even the slightest candle to what is provided in this. 
I could go on and on but I think that’s enough to get anyone to listen and be hooked."
Dbgcdc	20190313T230716	5	Very Well Done. Just Missing One Thing.	Very interesting. Only thing I wished they would have mentioned is that Adnon had sexual interactions with Stephanie. This could drum up a whole new theory. Did Jay do this to hurt Adnon and then frame him, to explain the cell phone adnon might have lent it to him which is why the calls match up.	Very interesting.

noygdmfbusiness	20190311T122923	2	Interesting But Deeply Flawed	(Spoiler warning) In episode 1, we hear teatimony feom the accused's friend Jay, a weed dealer who describes, in detail, how Adnan planned the murder of Hae, carried it out, and then asked Jay to help him quickly bury the body. There are specific details of what this girl looked like in the trunk of her murderer's car, and over 15 years later, Jay's story has not changed. This is why, with all the tabloid journalism of this podcast and the subsequent HBO series, Adnan was denied a new trial. The podcast is interesting, but ultimately lacking.	"(Spoiler warning)

Hfjhsjntgtruv	20190309T160226	5	A Girl Walks Into A Bar	"Sarah- Thank you for another season of Serial. I binged the first two and am looking forward to the HBO series on Adnan's case, which you brought to the forefront in Season One. This first episode of Season Three makes me hungry for more. A teacher, and a daughter of a man who served as a judge for over 30 years, the content doesn't surprise me. This first case sounded familiar on two fronts: I have heard similar stories from my dad but also recognize ""Anna"" (in premature stages) as students whom I work with daily. Thus, I am an English teacher who listened to this podcast through several lenses: as a woman, a teacher, the daughter of a judge, and as a seeker of justice. I believe you paint a realistic view of humanity as well as the criminal justice system, one of its most complicated, yet necessary creations. (You may find it interesting that I just finished reading Lord Of The Flies with one of my high school classes!) Sarah, you are a captivating writer and a wonderful orator. I wonder, however, if you ever considered editing the last line in the episode. Rather than asking the rhetorical question, ""Is this how it works in Cleveland?"" you could ask ""Is this how it works in the justice system?"" I don't think the situation you describe is specific to Cleveland but is a reality everywhere. (Editing the line would also help you stay true to your promise about not throwing the city of Cleveland under the bus!). This is minor, I know, but something that struck me at the end of the episode. I look forward to listening to more! Thank you!"	"Sarah- Thank you for another season of Serial.

Andybrewster	20190302T155902	4	Liar	I am only on episode four, and I know from media reports that Adnan got some kind of break after this podcast was aired. But the guy is a complete liar and you can tell by the comments he makes in episode four. He's talking about Jay and why Jay would have a motive to implicate him in murder. And he's actually jovial about it, saying he doesnt want to speculate or accuse Jay of bad intentions. Why on earth would you say this about someone Who is responsible for you spending time in jail from a murder you didn't commit?! A truly innocent person would be outraged at what Jay did! .

AJDC1979	20190228T174144	4	I Like This, But...	As with all things having to do with social, political ideology, there is no lack of clear leftisms in the podcast. That said, I feel like Sarah does a fairly good job of TRYING to be fair. There is a certain strain in her voice at times that disappears when she's back in her ideological lane. It's not glaring, but it's noticeable. I really enjoy This American Life and Serial is pretty good. I appreciate the work they put into the production and while I know I'm getting material presented by people I likely disagree with, I feel as if it's a two way conversation that's occurring. Like it's productive. For that I give 4 solid stars.	As with all things having to do with social, political ideology, there is no lack of clear leftisms in the podcast.

Heather Feather Renae	20190217T054744	4	I'Ll Stick Around For Next Season	I usually don't listen to things like this because so many are trying to prove blatantly guilty people innocent, and that annoys me to no end. There are people trying to get Scott Peterson out of jail right now. This Adnan guy killed that poor girl and it's SO obvious that he doesn't even care about the fact that she's dead. He obsessively calls her the night before her death and then never again. He's guilty. You can hear the psychopathy in his voice. The difference between what he says, and what Jay says at sentencing, that's your guide.

I started with Serial a year or two ago as my first foray into podcasts and I picked the wrong one, as so far the other ones I have listen do are ok, but then I started listening to season 3 of Serial and I realise that Sarah sets the bar exceedly high. From series 1 through to 3 the production, content and presentation are incredibly professional, humorous and informative. When I subscribe to a new podcast I have to remind myself that it is NOT the same caliber as Serial. Keep them coming Ms. Koenig and team.	I guess I started with the wrong podcast.

Although interesting and informative, this show seems to feed on the emotions of the guilty and focus on removing accountability of the subject's actions. The third season seems to make it a race issue. The narrator overly emphasized white judge, white cop, white lawyer, black man an trial, white mayor.	I’ve listened to all three seasons.

BreatheMindfully	20190217T012540	5	Very Interesting	I've only listened to Season 1, which I burned through in a short time. I'm now finding more info elsewhere regarding this case. WHY WONT THEY TEST THE DNA? Ughhhh! I feel mostly certain that Adnan is innocent, but there was a remark he made in the last episode around minute 49-50 that made me second guess that (something about he being the only person that knows 100%). I also feel like he doesn't come across as being very driven to get out of prison, whereas I think an innocent person would be.

The show is beautifully produced and researched. There are times when the host seems to be exploitive of folks truly in need and seems to pose herself to victims and criminals, alike, as being an advocate. To a point, she may be. But those featured on the show seem to not realize that the host is no benefactor. Yes, she will get the tip of your stories out to the public. But there is no apparent attempt to right wrongs—though it seems those featured obviously assume it and are allowed to fall under that guise.	Great job to the team.

vercul123	20190212T031837	5	Excellent	I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy this series and hope for more. I really appreciate that the speaker tries their best to remain neutral and fair when discussing the topics. Politics rarely creeps in. You really feel like you're getting the meat of the issue. It's given me better understanding of injustices in the criminal system as well as a better understanding of Bowe Bergdahl. I really appreciate these opportunities to formulate better founded opinions. In this day and age it feels like the extremists on both sides of the aisle have taken over and they drown out the important issues. Thank you guys for creating such excellent content!

liz102938	20190211T204011	3	Worth A Listen	The first season of this podcast was AMAZING. It was all focused on one case, delved deep into detail, and kept things interesting. It really left me wanting more like it. Then it started to waver. The second season was ok, I liked it because I had interest in that case prior to listening and it was good at giving more detail. The last season, however, was nothing like the first or second and frankly wasn't my cup of tea. I'm not a fan of political opinions coming into play in my podcasts, and this season includes more political bias than others. It also only looks at a court house per episode rather than debating the different sides to a controversial case.	"The first season of this podcast was AMAZING.

SORIANOTRON	20190123T173051	4	Great! But Came Across Biased And Naive....	"Excellent podcast, format, research and presentation. Loved it, thoroughly entertaining! However, I did feel the narrator was slightly naive in her judgment of Adnan. She was very judgmental and almost sympathetic in regards to his meek appearance and docile demeanor as a 17 year old which lead me to feeling she had a bias for his innocence from the first episodes. In the end after all the time, research and resources used to review and put together this podcast, it pretty much supported everything detectives had already used to arrest and convict Adnan. I'm not sure if this podcast did any good or bad for this case, it certainly stirred up unpleasant emotions from the victims family and in the end its not like a ""smoking gun"" or radical new evidence was presented. (The girl in the library is interesting at best, but its not anything SOLID like forensic DNA or surveillance video.) The podcast went to great lengths to prove Adnan's possible innocence, but did almost nothing to explain who might have done it then? It's almost like the podcast was so focused on Adnans innocence opposed to finding out what really happened. I think the narrator not having much as far as street smarts (not a bad thing or a flaw) played heavy into her bias not believing someone who appears so innocent as Adnan could have possibly done this. Anyone is possible of anything. That's important to remember in life. Not saying Adnan is guilty, but I'm a firm believer in Occam's razor...."	"Excellent podcast, format, research and presentation.

Felix Snow	20190130T174725	1	Very Left-Leaning Angle	While I like the first season, the third season reveals a very anti-police, anti-white slant that I find offputting. I know police officers in Cleveland and they say that they are sick of all the black crime and if they do anything forceful to detain a black criminal, they are under intense scrutiny. The commentator practically laughs at police who say they aren't going to change anything about the way they handle crime. She thinks the way they handle black suspects is racist - when it is not. I know cops handle criminals the same - whether black or white. If anything, they are more lenient on black criminals because of the intense media bias they face all the time. So I strongly dislike the third season. Again, it's become mainstream - so controlled by a leftist agenda - which is wrong.

To me, the narrator's blindness to Adnan's careful selection of language, his attempts at seeming oh so understanding of the prosecution and his accusers, and his portrayal as being someone incapable of this horror, was the real story. He manipulated the narrator from the inception and she fell for it hook line and sinker. Eyes like a dairy cow? Seriously? An interesting story nonetheless.

Until then, it is a great story and they are working the debble out of it. Very compelling, it gives me a sense of just how fragile our justice system is. Also about how we think about people once they are convicted. I want to see what happens with this story, it keeps getting more interesting. But I also want to see what story they take on next. Good business! The Second Season was less compelling than the first, the Third Season is a jam. That Third Season is the kind of in-depth investigative reporting America needs. While there is a justice seeking, liberal bias, the reporting was such that I had to reconsider some of my own liberal ideas.	"I would have given it five stars if it had a consistent time.

I looked up the website and read that the judge granted it but it still has to go to State for approval but I am disappointed that there were no more updates on the podcast. I'm assuming this is because you started a season 2 for us to listen to. Humans like closure though and I'm sure I can speak for many and say you had us really worked up and waiting in anticipation.

It is actually 100% inconsequential whether or not he did or didn't do it. The point is to show that some way, some how, this guy was sentenced to life with such an absurdly small amount of evidence that it ought to make you afraid to even have friends. The justice system is in need of serious reform, and the fact that you can be charged with murder with no DNA evidence linking you to the crime, based on nothing but circumstantial evidence and how likable the witnesses presented might be is a disgusting betrayal of justice, REGARDLESS of whether this man did it or not. Even if he did do it, it is still a disgusting betrayal of justice that he was able to be sentenced with so little pointing to him. This podcast did a great job showing that. And to people who were annoyed with the same small details being brought up each episode, you clearly missed how these things relate to the bigger picture that I mentioned as they are brought up again in light of new reference points that make them questionable at best, and continue to show how unbelievable it is that these pieces of ""evidence"" (if you can even call them that with a straight face) were used to sentence this man, guilty or not. I recommend listening again with this in mind if you found it ethically questionable the first time around. Look at the bigger picture."

And to people who were annoyed with the same small details being brought up each episode, you clearly missed how these things relate to the bigger picture that I mentioned as they are brought up again in light of new reference points that make them questionable at best, and continue to show how unbelievable it is that these pieces of “evidence” (if you can even call them that with a straight face) were used to sentence this man, guilty or not. I recommend listening again with this in mind if you found it ethically questionable the first time around. Look at the bigger picture.
rivkaann	20181226T224445	5	Loved It	"Season 1, Innocent until proven guilty. This podcast showcases the lack of a system we have here in the US. Adnan like many other non white men, went to jail with no proof or evidence that he indeed did it. Wonderful work here in bringing to light the injustices of our ""justice"" system. Didn't listen to season 2 but loved season 3's unveiling of mistreatment, police brutality and corrupt behavior that happens on a regular basis in major cities. We need more people talking about this and to care about these problems in order for us to see change."	Season 1, Innocent until proven guilty.

Papa John 2017	20181226T004749	2	Strong Obvious Bias; Strong Hostess Harsh Profanity	"Make no mistake, Miss Koenig is a social Leftist, and even a cursory listen reveals this all too frequently. This is not a critique of her view, but her beating the listener over the head with it. At the end of Season 3, she ""waxes poetic"" about her ""suggestions for change. Much of her rationale she could not have gotten from her reporting experience, and her strong bias shows. So if you are willing do do the work of filtering out her bias, this is can be informative. Also, her unprofessional crass, course (profane) language is extremely off-putting, as she mirrors the criminals she follows through the system. The criminals curse harshly (f-bombs, s-bombs) and though they should mute these, they do not. But they do warn you that it's coming... ....what they do *not* warn you about is that SHE....the hostess....drops her own set of f-bombs, s-bombs with u fortunate regularity. Very unfortunate, and unprofessional. Advise, in summary, for season 4: (1) No cursing (mute, don't bleep out...this only draws attention to it), and certainly none from the professionals (2) No bias. The listener oughtn't be able to tell your POV so readily...preferably not at all. This can, and should be done, and would elevate the quality of the podcast. (3) Stick to the facts, not your gossip about one thing or the other. It's unbecoming of a professional (ties w/ 2)."

Instead of telling two stories in one episode and confusing the audience, they should have kept it one story per episode. The Adnan season was the best, and every season after that has not been as interesting. The actual subject of the last season, the juvenile court system, was eye-opening. But none of the characters in the episodes since Adnan have captured the audience's attention like Adnan did.	The last season of Serial was disjointed.

This show has gradually become worse, and it's not due to bad production, research, host, etc. It's due to the content. Maybe that reflects on the host and producers that do the research or pick the topics, but Season 2-3 are stale compared to the magic that was Season 1. Give us more true crime (murder) investigation again!	Frankly had to adjust my review after Season 3.

Season 2 was pretty frustrating because they are glorifying a deserter but I still listened to the entire season because what the guy went trough was interesting. Season 3 may as well be a political podcast. The women sets the tone in her opening monologue about just how SJW this is going be. Setting white people up to be evil, black people as oppressed, ect. Why not just tell the story and leave your political views out of it?	Listened to season 1 years ago and it led to me listening to tons of other podcasts. It was very enjoyable to listen to.

I enrolled shortly after listening to Season 1 TWICE. While I appreciate the diversity between seasons, season 3 would have to be my least favorite. Looking forward to another single case study at some point; an unsolved murder or disappearance would be interesting.	She literally has the best voice; her tone and inflection are unparalleled.

As a white male who has actually experienced the criminal justice system first hand, I often have conversations with other white men and women who seem to have no real understanding of how lucky we are... I am not a felon. Not because I haven't been charged with felonies, but only because I was able to pay my way out of them. I have always been given the benefit of the doubt anytime I have been in front of a judge, encountered the police, or talked to a prosecutor. The majority of people in prison have not been afforded these same opportunities to use the system to their advantage, and the majority of those people are men of color. Thank you for this season. There is real truth here, and more people in a position to do something about it need to hear that truth.	I cannot express how much this most recent season of serial moved me.

chrisreccj	20181212T035111	5	Loved It	I've had my own experiences dealing with the system since childhood and into adulthood. I was supposed to help out for an episode on npr I believe. It had to do with public defense and whether or not it was important. My previous representative that the court had given me during the case contacted me asking if I'd talk to them. He'd basically saved me from jail time or dui program at the least. While dealing with multiple diagnoses including blood cancer the city took me to court with no drugs on my person, in my car or in my blood and no alcohol. I'd passed out because I couldn't breathe after dialysis and they attempted to establish a dui case first and thing and continued including the officer showing up at court and trying to speak to me as if he weren't the entire reason the district attorney was still holding onto my case. In the end even with a lawyer stepping up (after seeing he could certify everything I explained and I could provide 90% of my own case from my folder I keep for all insurance and proofs needed for intensive care) they still wanted to keep after me. I've seen the system in my area work on most of the lower levels spoken of in the show. So needless to say I can relate to this production. It makes me sad to know the feeling to which you speak. I've spent my fair share of time sitting in magistrate offices and criminal court to see the way things are in our country (or at least on my states level). I've thought about it all and you fairly nailed it dead on in the end. Too bad they won't listen.	I’ve had my own experiences dealing with the system since childhood and into adulthood.

I am a minor podcast masochist that will still listen to ideas that I disagree with or believe are wrong. I try to broaden my perspective at the cost of my own discomfort. Second, I am part of the criminal justice system, so my perspective/experience is different from the ones in this podcast. As far as the podcast goes, it is well done and it tells a compelling story, but... I feel that is all that it is. It is not a balanced report and levels baseless accusations like saying family of judges get free rides without any analysis. I would prefer a balanced approach and they had all the tools being Cleveland gave such access. Too bad it feels so biased.	"First, I should say that I will continue to listen.

CAP684	20181201T225544	1	What Happened!?	This used to be an awesome pod cast with solid journalism reporting. Unfortunately, this most recent season became nothing more than a pathetic agenda of police bashing, race baiting, and liberal propaganda. The reporter has an obvious bias against law enforcement and authority that is highlighted front and center in just about every episode. The whole thing becomes lazy and mimics the nonsense spewed from main stream media on a daily basis. What a shame.	This used to be an awesome pod cast with solid journalism reporting.

There have have been imitators that are garbage(Up and Vanished, anyone?), yet Serial is the one I stuck with. Season 2 wasn't as engaging, but was still a worthwhile listen. Season 3 is by far the weakest. It's not engaging, and very biased. It veers on ""social justice warrior"" territory, which is unfortunate. The criminals, admitted criminals at that, are repulsive, yet Sarah seems to want the listener to sympathize with and even feel sorry for them. Social Justice garbage has unfortunately weeded it's ugly, unwanted head into this otherwise good podcast. The quality is still top notch, but I really hope Season 4 returns to its roots.

Brooklyn6ersFan	20181122T163049	5	Absolutely Fascinating	Season 3 was AMAZING. I have not enjoyed a pod like this... probably ever. Finally someone exposes the nonsense people go through at courthouses every single day. With no fancy lawyer to spend countless hours and money to advocate for you. While a prosecutor seems to be prosecuting you because they can with no consideration to wether they should. It is all so unfair and if you dont have money the scales are heavily weighed against you from the moment you step in there. Everyone is so caught up in cases like steve avery and how unjust his case seemed. What about the kid who cooperated with the prosecution, gave them multiple convictions and was rewarded with 9 years in the same prison as the people he helped put away? What about the lady who was charged with assaulting a police officer because she made contact with him while being assaulted by several people? Things like that happen to thousands of people a day and they walk in to court with a public defender who has 5 other cases that day and maybe they care or maybe they are just punching the clock. Against a prosecutor who can spend whatever they need to can subpoena whoever they need to and charge you with whatever they feel like.	Season 3 was AMAZING.

More importantly, Serial's exhaustive work on Season 1 resulted in the court's vacated the conviction of Adnan Syed, and a new trial scheduled.

Koenig is practically gushing over Sayed waiting for a conjugal visit. Any detail that shows he's a ""good man"" is highlighted yet not corroborated with facts while a rumor of how heinous he can possibly be is left as untold because it's unsubstantiated. Very biased reporting and this story could've been told in 3-4 episodes not the mind numbing 12. I 30 second'd through the last 4 episodes and have no desire to listen to the retrial. I don't know if he's innocent or guilty and this Podcast did him no favors. Let the participants in the story talk and stop rehashing the last episode into 3/4s of the next. Dr Death got it right and has spoiled me to expect that caliber of production."	This is painful.

Her whole bleeding heart routine from the 1st to 3rd season is for the benefit of murders and criminals; obviously she's too sheltered to have ever been a victim herself.

I listened from front to back and I actually listened to it twice to make sure I didn't miss anything. Season two was hard to follow with interest as we already knew most of the facts that were being told. Additionally there was no mystery or wondering. It was just a retelling of the story that's already been told which was in the limelight of the news. Season three was boring completely. I listened to the whole season just to make sure that I wasn't missing anything or to see if it was going to get better after the first couple episodes... that didn't happen. I'm on sure as to why this podcast ventured away from how they took to season one. I hope that season four will be laid out and have similarities to season one regards to being a mystery and an untold story.	Season one was soooooo good it hooked me in instantly!

BYRD!389	20181117T195044	5	Shedding An Honest Light On The Criminal Justice System	This has been the most enlightened and factual series of serial I've ever experienced. The first two season were awesome because they played as written fiction though they were truly real life. This season was as bibliographic listening of the Black and POC lives in the world of America. I appreciate the attention to the smaller cases, cases they truly do ignored and abuses by the judges. As well as showing how the Blue Wall is truly a paid gang. That they will watch out for themselves before up holding the real justice. Despite that, I thank you for allowing true individuals who what to rehabilitate these men and women behind bars. They are far and in between. But they exist and they really are trying. This was amazing! Thank You guys!	This has been the most enlightened and factual series of serial I’ve ever experienced.

210 Rob	20181117T181540	3	Choosing Sides	Listening to Season 3, I enjoy and appreciate Sarah and Emmanuel's line of questioning and investigative research however often it sounds like they are siding with the defendant. I'll allow that the defendant is often simultaneously a victim of vengeful, racist, immoral police officers and overzealous judges and prosecutors, but at the end of the day, these defendants/victims are criminals at their core and require at least rehabilitation and retribution at worst. As Sarah herself has asked, do they have a choice? Unequivocally, yes. Whether it's not walking around with a blunt or walking away from a bad situation, they always have a choice. I hope as I continue to follow this season that Sarah and the rest of the Serial team dig into the criminals a little more skeptically. I also hope we refocus on the courthouse and less on these particular cases which are interesting but not deeply intriguing or demonstrative.

Toasternuggest	20181116T164858	3	Season 3 Was A Let Down	I loved season 1, and mostly liked season 2 (though it wasn't as interesting but was still worth listening to), but season 3—I just couldn't get excited about. I'm interested in law school, so hearing the perspective of the attorneys and what their daily work was like was great to hear for me personally, but the obvious bias in this season started to become obnoxious after a couple of episodes in. As someone with a criminal justice background, I absolutely agree that the system has flaws, that the justice system sentences minorities on a harsher scale across the country than whites, and that lengthy sentences do not deter crime. There is plenty of research to support this, but this season does little to actually support that with these stories. I feel like the constant argument is that the criminals interviewed for these stories, who are committing crimes over and over again (by their own choice most of the time), are somehow not to blame for their actions. Police brutality is certainly real and it happens, and I think in some of these reports it really happened and should've been punished, but I feel this season just painted everyone who works in the justice system, especially in Ohio, as racist and as if they have zero good intentions. It felt like an hour long blame game session, without any type of suggestion for how they would recommend fixing these issues. I'm generally left leaning in politics, but I just couldn't get over how wide a brush Serial used to paint everyone in a negative light except the habitual offenders. Oh and she absolutely lost me over the sentencing of the guy who shot the baby. I absolutely agree with that prosecutor. The season was okay. But it was that—just okay.

BingMiller	20181116T023748	5	Great Season	Just finished season three and I loved it for different reasons than I did season one. It's like the third Indiana Jones - it gets back to what makes the franchise great and it may even be better than the first. The storytelling elevates the everyday criminal cases to real compelling drama.	Just finished season three and I loved it for different reasons than I did season one.

The stories pull you in and are so personal and touching. And it is all put together with Sarah's unbeatable perfect words, sentences, and voice.

Season 1 and 3 were awesome! I'm sad that they came to an end. I understand that Adnan Syed will get a new trial and I pray they are going to follow it!

People have been waking up to a lot of things about racism and the injustices of the so-called criminal justice system. But Serial Season 3, by focusing on a group of individual stories within a specific system, really shows how deeply deeply corrupt and dysfunctional things are. Please listen.

jooojooojojo	20181114T141315	5	The Best Podcast!	Believe the hype! This is undoubtedly one the best podcast available. So many other podcast series in the genre (e.g. Up and Vanished) don't come close to serial! A lot of others struggle with the follow up season(s). They can't recreate whatever made their first good. Every season, every episode of serial is good. These aren't stories you have or would have heard about without this podcast. It is well produced, organized, and thoughtful. This podcast is more than just entertainment it is thought-provoking and makes you see the justice system from a perspective most people wouldn't otherwise have. Guilty doesn't always mean guilty. A person labeled a criminal often didn't have any other choice, and our justice system is flawed. I appreciate the hosts sensitivity and empathy. She gives people a chance and a voice that otherwise wouldn't. :red_heart:️ I only listen to other crime podcasts while waiting on new seasons of serial!	Believe the hype!

rlainebrown	20181112T204134	3	Listener Warning —	I love Serial. The first season is THE reason I listen to true crime podcasts now. I love the talk about the legal system in Baltimore and how legal reform, across our nation, needs to happen because of cases like Adnan's. That being said, the new season is just biased. There is a way to research and report on the court system, talk to criminals, and open eyes to legal advocacy and this is falls short of providing us with an unbiased perspective of the Court. It's hard to listen at times because the reporters themselves seem to get lost in the story...in some cases they are talking to VERY violent criminals. While they are absolutely still human beings, they broke the law and somehow this podcast is trying to paint them in a glowing light. Not all episodes in season 3 are told with this same bias, so it is still worth listening to and taking some of the conversations and reporting with a grain of salt. Regardless, I appreciate what they are doing.	I love Serial. The first season is THE reason I listen to true crime podcasts now.

His language, accent and expression was inaccessible to me so I basically missed half of what was going on despite really wanting to understand him.

There are many podcasts who detail stories, especially crime stories and do it from and unbiased approach of story telling. As a listener, I want to hear the story and decide for myself who the victims are and what I believe has happened. I don't want to hear someone else's bias. I do understand that's the goal and approach of this podcast, and I just wish it wasn't because I really liked it. I know it's super popular, and the vast majority of the reviews are going to reflect that. I just wish I agreed. Not every criminal is a victim and no one deserves to be victimized by anyone.

As a listener, I want to hear the story and decide for myself who the victims are and what I believe has happened. I don’t want to hear someone else’s bias. I do understand that’s the goal and approach of this podcast, and I just wish it wasn’t because I really liked it. I know it’s super popular, and the vast majority of the reviews are going to reflect that. I just wish I agreed. Not every criminal is a victim and no one deserves to be victimized by anyone. When will you focus or really give an attention to the victims of the criminals you spotlight? When do they matter?
Sara Wm dks;amd kwa;	20181108T165333	2	Its An Interesting Podcast	Some of the stories are really interesting. You get an understanding of what the criminal justice system is like in other states. Don't much care for the way the interviews are constructed they seem like they have a large amount of bias.	Some of the stories are really interesting.

I thought the inconclusive ending of season 1 was done right and that the team stayed fair and honest by not passing their own verdict. But, as much as I loved that first season, I'm loving this one so much more. It speaks to the times when we know everything is socially fraught but there seems to be a taboo to raise the racial and gender issues behind them. Sarah's voice and narration are perfect for keeping a listener curious and engaged so much so that even the minutiae of the American legal system doesn't bore.	"I loved Serial from the get-go.

LisaGHZ	20181108T143905	1	Season 3 Is Boring	Season 1 of Serial was fascinating, thought provoking and groundbreaking. Nothing even remotely like it had been produced before and it was hard not to completely immerse yourself in the story more and more with each episode. The direction they've gone in with Season 3 is just awful though. Another podcast about the court system. The episodes have been bland, unremarkable and just not insightful in any way. I unsubscribed and can't bear to listen it—so unfortunate from such a talented team.	Season 1 of Serial was fascinating, thought provoking and groundbreaking.

DestinyRae95	20181108T142638	2	Loses Momentum	I got hooked on this podcast extremely quick. The case is highly intriguing, leaves you guessing, and has some twists. BUT, it loses all of this extremely quick. After all the information is unloaded, there's nothing left to discuss. There are some episodes where everything is basically repeated over and over while there is still nothing to actually point to whether Adnan actually murdered his ex-girlfriend or not. The excitement and intrigue quickly turn into frustration over the repetitive information and speculative theories.	I got hooked on this podcast extremely quick.

ThePoopsmith89	20181105T012923	1	Horribly Subjective And Biased	My expectation from this podcast was an objective and factual examination of criminal cases, and boy was I let down. While season 1 was largely captivating (albeit with a horribly disappointing conclusion), season 3 has taken an aggressive turn for the worse. I skipped season 2 due to lack of interest, but based on the other reviews, I'd wager it's just like what I've experienced with season 3 up to this point. I am 3 episodes down in season 3, and it has been nothing but a biased bashing of the Cleveland court system and police department with little to no decipherable direction or point. This woman Sarah's anti-cop and anti-establishment mentality is alarming. I'm not going to sit here and say that our system is perfect and free of error, but this shameful and shameless agenda is dangerous. All she has done here is unfairly attempt to create resentment without offering both sides of the story. No solution is offered. It is apparent by the smug commentary that you are simply expected to agree with her as she hates on the system. If you're a member of the liberal mob, and you want to be angry with cops, then season 3 of this podcast is for you. Otherwise, stay away.

This is a high quality and slick production that's fun to listen to, but the episodes are clearly and unabashedly trying to pit listeners against those whom the creators of Serial have already decided are the big ""baddies"" without letting listeners decide for themselves. For example, before we even hear a law enforcement person speak in episode 3, Koenig says, ""He lamely responded..."" and then includes a quote from this person. Why don't you let us decide whether his response was ""lame?"" We very well might do that on our own if you give us a chance, but force feeding us your views is both patronizing and annoying.

I loved the first two seasons, and I want to keep loving Serial! Just give us honest and objective reporting. Let us draw the conclusions. That's what made Season 1 so great."

SuperShannon	20181028T024205	1	Disappointed With Season 3	I loved both seasons 1 and 2 of the podcast, but you kind of lost me during season 3. I'm having a hard time with the way most of the criminal offenders are being portrayed as victims. What about the actual victims of their crimes/offenses? It comes across at times like Sara is brushing over the crimes they've committed as though they are no big deal, and in one of the episodes she questions the length of sentencing for a murder as though it's too long. I'm going to finish listening to the season because I think she's a great story teller, but I wish this season she would have stayed a bit more neutral and not so biased towards the criminals.

Chad bai	20181027T164010	1	Season 3	I started to listen to season 3. I know Sara is extremely left but I put up with it because she had interesting stories. However in season 3 episode 1 she mentions race no less than 15 times in an hour show. I'm so sick of everything being race or politics or both. Not worth my time. Btw, by interjecting race into EVERY scenario, you water it down so much that when there really is some kind of racial injustice, people don't give it the time of day. Crying wolf to get people to listen is not my cup of tea. Good luck to you.	I started to listen to season 3.  I know Sara is extremely left but I put up with it because she had interesting stories.

Most other countries do not have an option of a plea deal for many legitimate reasons. If a prosecutor sees fit to charge you with a certain crime which holds a certain penalty then why should you be offered a lesser charge with lesser time with the same evidence? So many moving factors as reasons. This episode was eye opening, wonderfully done.

Sarah, the narrator, puts a bleeding heart spin on the story/episodes to fit her political agenda. Your listeners are not here for that. If we were, we could just turn on CNN or Fox news. We are here to get lost in a murder mystery. Not to hear how you believe in the convicts, and show little to no compassion to the victim and or The families left behind. If you are really big into NPR, then you'll probably love this podcast. I simply don't think journalism should take either side, it should just tell the story and let the listener decide for themselves.	"I agree with most of the negative reviews of this podcast.

Hopefully it will spur radical change in our judicial system. It should be required listening by every prosecuter, mayor, city council member, judge, cop etc.	Reporting doesn't get better than this.

Noyster2	20181020T144605	5	Season 3 Is Spellbinding	"I commend Ms. Koenig and her team on this deep dive into the American justice system. In season three Koenig offers up literate sketches of individuals on both sides of the legal system alongside historical perspective on how money, the scarcity of time and politics shaped the law and sentencing. We come away with a sense of the legal system as a great, creaky machine inexorably threshing through lives. The many moving parts of the machine, alternately likable, heroic, hapless, brutal or sly, are forced into shapes that fit the clockwork. I've read though a number of reviews posted here and I see that there are some angry suggestions that Koenig's team has a ""liberal"" bias (usually followed with indignant threats that the listener intends to unsubscribe.) How different is Season Three from the preceding two that it merits this new partisan response? Rather than focusing on one person's journey through the twists and turns of a convoluted system it is that system itself in the spotlight. All three seasons feature 'good' and 'bad' cops but here we run into the ""Blue wall"" as an institution. Each courtroom seems an individual fiefdom subject to the judges' personal style which ranges from beneficial practicality to unsettling paternalistic entitlement. And the lawyers are institutionally forced into the role of a cattle dealer: throwing in a few good heifers to sweeten the deal. This U.S. Constitution's uplifting central guarantee to every American's right to a ""day in court"" is sullied by the gritty transactional process."

I figured after a boring season 2 they would return to form. Nope, it got worse. Season 3, Epsiode 1; I kept waiting for the tragic turn where the girl in the bar fight's story begins and pulls me in for a season long rollercoaster. Wrong again, sadly. Episode 2, I lasted 20 minutes it was so uninteresting. Season 3 is like a bad episode of 20/20. Only so boring 20/20 wouldn't air it. Serial has gone from the model of engaging and suspenseful podcasts to left in the dust by shows like Crime Town, Up and Vanished, Dirty John, Dr Death, etc.	"Season 1 blew my mind with every minute of every episode.

She would be better served to go where her investigations take her.

The reporting as always is excellent and the narrative captures the listener's attention, but I wholeheartedly understand why the city of Cleveland has been tight lipped. Sure there are bad cops, bad judges, bad lawyers, bad criminals and yes, bad reporters! It sure would be nice to listen to more positive stories to inspire others with good role models. You have shown the duplicity of several of the accused in these accounts, but when is the liberal media going to understand that illegal is just that. Do you not advocate punishment for wrongdoing? It's unfortunate and wrong that several have been convicted unfairly. But let's move on , learn and stop belittling those who make mistakes.

T. Fraser	20181012T141027	2	First Season Is Amazing, But It'S All Downhill From There	The first season is phenomenal, which is probably why it took off. Unfortunately, the second season is lackluster: the protagonists are boring, the plot doesn't really have any interesting twists, and the setting doesn't pique your curiosity. The third season is even worse. Sarah et al. veer off into overtly political proselytizing, and the podcasts get very predictable very quickly. It's the same old talking points you hear everywhere, with no meaningful exploration of the problems and no discussion of solutions anywhere at all. People aren't interviewed to gain insight, instead they're queried in the hopes of the perfect sound clip to brandish as supporting evidence of a one-dimensional , oversimplified argument. No one, including the audience, is expected to actually think about the subject matter or the message of podcast. After the fifth episode I moved on to better shows.

try55times	20181011T163543	5	Season 3 Ep 5	This was one of the best episodes of Serial I have experienced. I heard the frustration of the social debates over crime punishment sentencing attitudes from several perspectives. It just strengthened my belief that anyone that feels black and white over how to reform our criminal justice system is being naïve. It is complicated and messy and gray. There is too much vengeance and too much retribution driving the debate. I don't think justice involves either of those things.	This was one of the best episodes of Serial I have experienced.

kajhejenfhutn	20181009T062110	1	Police Life	I am not sure this will get read, but I want to address the issues regarding police officers and their approach to criminal activity. The reporters in this series seem to think that by questioning citizens who continuously have run ins with law enforcement or questioning police officers who do their jobs to enforce the law that they now know what should be done in these difference cases. Being a police officer is much greater than one case here or there. It is a lifetime of service to a community that usually is met with hostility, disrespect, and hatred. It is one of the hardest careers that any one human being can take on. A picture and narrative has been painted that if any use of force is used that it automatically is unfair and incomprehensible. How in the world can and would an officer use force? My suggestion is to go on a ride along with officers in major metropolitan areas and see for yourself what goes on in the streets. See for yourself how officers are talked to and treated. People wonder why force is an issue, but don't stop to wonder why? Officers, the majority of them, do not want to have to use force to get the job done, but when people don't listen and refuse to respond to commands given lawfully by a person who holds the authority to do so, it will end in a forceful action taken by a police officer. It likely will not be pretty and someone is bound to get hurt or possible bleed. It is very rare that we see true excessive force that is charged in cases against officers, because there is usually a command that was not obeyed. While I enjoy listening to your podcasts, I cringe when I hear a constant disdain for law enforcement and the women and men who put on a uniform day in and day out, leave their families and serve and protect people they will never know nor will they ever get thanked for doing so. There are always opportunities for growth in law enforcement as there is in any profession. There is also a lot of room for growth on holding people accountable for their actions and lack there of. We, as a community, need to stop fighting against the people who are trying to bring order to our communities and start supporting the effort in holding criminals accountable for their actions. If there are people who are constantly in contact with law enforcement, there is a problem and I can guarantee you it's not the fault of the police officers. My challenge to you all as reporters and the creators of multiple podcast's, do more research on what it takes to do the job as a police officer. What skills, reactionary disciple and patience it takes to deal with so many challenging individuals and communities. I feel that your reporting is extremely one sided and the communication that you do share is from some guy that didn't explain policing well at all. Maybe he did and you just skewed the podcast to make him sound like he didn't care about the community? I am not sure? Whatever the case is, be fair in your podcasts and show people that you can in fact try to see both sides. Be a solution to what you think is a problem instead of add more fuel to an existing fire.

Janebiss12	20181007T001557	5	Cluelessly Insensitive	"There is some fantastic reporting here. Full stop. But my question is: who is your audience for this podcast? Because you often sound like you're talking to white people who will be similarly shocked (although shock coming from you sounds more like bemusement). What if you presumed that a part of your audience knows about the kind of incidents you describe, or —gasp— has direct experience with a deeply unjust justice system? How would that impact your storytelling? Your ""we"" simply does not include people of color. I hesitate to give this feedback lest it fuel the ""white people can't tell black stories,"" narrative which I really don't believe. But i do think that you can come across as a very dangerous kind of entitled person. You seem to think that because you can identify the nuances of prejudice, that your translation/delivery can't be racially insensitive. Your light and bouncy tone, jokey treatment and sometimes overwritten descriptions of racists, racist incidents and racist institutions only dilute the horror, make it easier for people to tolerate. Either give us facts only, or stop making lovable characters out of despicable humans. I stopped counting how many times you laughed or made jokes in inappropriate places. These are people's lives you're reporting about. You sound like someone who literally has nothing to lose. Throwing in a black Brit for 5 minutes a podcast is not the solution (yes, I'm sure you all anticipated that kind of blowback). STOP BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM. You may be aware of your privilege, but you haven't figured out how to keep it from bleeding into every part of the stories you tell. Please note: I have felt this in your other pieces as well."

Emmitt Daisy	20181005T195027	2	Apparent Bias.	Honestly, this would be great if the narrator would leave her own biased opinions out of it. But she obviously wants to push her opinions on the listener. This was recommended to me by a colleague and I was so hopeful to listen to some non-biased, quality discussion. Nope. Not here.

I really enjoyed how the author kept everything unbiased and very fact driven and how she could see things from both sides. Season two was good but the author clearly gained some confidence from season one and started projecting her own opinion on what she thought versus seeing both sides. Season three I had to stop listening because it was no longer unbiased and the author was clearly pushing her own agenda. It was an unfortunate progression...	"I absolutely loved season one.

Boredbutnotthatbored	20181004T190237	1	Disappointed	I loved the first two seasons of this podcast. Binged then both. I was excited when I heard about the topic of season three because Sarah had a chance to shed light on a very misunderstood topic. Instead, she ruins her reporting with her obvious bias and emotion reactions to her perceived injustices. Whenever Sarah does not know the answer to a question she presents, she inserts her own answer riddled with uneducated bias instead of searching to understand the true answer. I have first hand experience in this area and can say that Serial really gets this one wrong. Really disappointed in this season.	I loved the first two seasons of this podcast. Binged then both.

All the while not taking into consideration the safety and welfare of those who are out there on the street, putting their lives on the line to protect people. If blunt dude in the project just complied, there wouldn't even be a case. No injuries, no report, no lawsuit. Happens every day to normal people. Report on that story.

I was clear from the start of the pod-cast that they had an agenda to blame white males for everything they consider wrong with the justice system. Why not just admit you are prejudice against this of group and say it's your opinion? Say that's your cause and that the rest of this is selective facts and opinion. Sarah should try being a police officer, see how awful all these people that protect her truly are. Listen to a different side of the story that takes courage to tell. I think people are getting pretty sick of hearing how criminals are victims. It's pretty cowardly not to stick up for the victims of crimes and their families because it may be unpopular. It's clear none of these limousine liberals have to worry about being a victim of a crime themselves or have had to pursue justice if it's politically incorrect. Grow up, do what's right.

Have to say, completely understand the popularity of the podcast. Always intersting and emotionally riveting... Putting that aside, i clearly hear what others have stated on the negative reviews about political agenda being made to appear righteous and morally correct. Episode two of season three is a glaringly example of that... Whatever perceived stereotype that the host and other commentators contributing to this particular episode try hard to make the listener believe how horribly illigal Judge Gaul conducts his court... Not buying it, it seems to me he gets reelected because of the manner he goes about his business. Seem not care about repeat offenders who do have numerous kids out of wedlock from different partners who don't support these kids and go on to the next one. What about these mothers and there abandoned children? What about there rights? All touchy feely about the criminal who leaves them ridiculous!

I don't remember how I found Serial but I've been consuming episodes over the past week and love this.

MikeNSami2008	20180930T124928	1	Entertaining But Frustrating	"Ive liked season 1 And listening to season 3 now. Like the finish to Season 1 and this season- I hate hate HATE - that Sarah will take ""1 side of the story as 100% TRUE"" even though the person shes talking to, she'll admit that the some of the persons facts were INCORRECT from time to time but then let it go.. However all the police, lawyers, and anyone representing the otherside only giving partial stories or audio- she always questions, investigates, and ignores what they have to say as if THEY are guilty opposed to the criminals shes interviewing. Yes .. maybe this woman was locked up for being touched, but wasnt that her audio CLEARLY out of control in the police car? The guy with the blunt ( and my 4 yo) why after the fact would he come on a podcast and admit he resisted and/or got loud? First thing my 4y and any white OR black person does when caught doing something wrong is LIE or resist punishment .. If the woman and guy cooperated these stupid charges would likely not have happened, which is clearly what the police have been attempting to say. You guys are taking advantage of the majority of Americans that cant see thru the BS - You are no different than what you say the police are doing. I am white and I have been treated the same exact way in courtrooms - That does need to change. This does not only happen to african Americans or women or just in ohio."

Not the same either the third season! She very obviously is attempting to present opinions at the expense of fact. Much less reporting and a whole lot more perspective.

This series puts some of the hardest reflections of our society involving crime and justice out in the open for discussion. If you are a hard core establishment person like many of my law enforcement friends are, then you will likely want to avoid this series. If you care about your fellow Americans and understand that who gets charged with crimes is complicated and requires additional research and data to disprove popular myths then this podcast will provide you with rich thought provoking content.

ellevdee	20180928T233827	5	Non Political	This podcast is so addicting. Sarah has such a way about her. Even though she is interviewing people who are in very controversial situations, she always remains completely unbiased. This is such a breath of fresh air to listen to a story which can so easily be swayed left or right but it remains right in the middle. She doesn't push any propaganda. These stories just pull you in and you can't stop listening. So thank you Sarah for not making me want to turn it off for forcing any kind of opinions down your listeners throats!

MasterCheif101	20180928T195008	1	Storyteller'S Bias Permeates Every Episode Of This Season.	I greatly enjoyed the first season of Serial up until the last episode or two when I didn't receive the payoff I hoped for and was left wondering Did he or didn't he? I felt in the new episode. The second season was good and I understand and accept that the storyteller's perspective will come through to some extent. This is true as well of This American Life but I have never felt it overwhelmed the story telling. Same with Serial until I get to this Season 3. Ms. Koenig does her listeners and her a great disservice because everything reported is told through her severely biased lens so unlike past seasons of Serial where there is room for listeners to make up their minds, here Ms. Koenig not only tells you the story but also tells you what you ought to think about that story. The words she chooses; the way she sets things up strikes the tone that led 60 million deplorables to vote the current clown into the White House, the pseudo-intellectual, superior attitude of you 'if you don't share my point of view, you're ignorant and racist' shines through in every one of the three episodes. As one who generally accepts that police violence and bias exists I was turned off by how slanted this season is.

Raven Valkyrie 7745692	20180928T165740	5	Im So Happy Youre Telling These Stories	Thank you for reporting these stories of corruption in season 3. At 10am one morning the police came to my house to serve me on a dog off leash charge (which I'll also note they had no evidence for and I had to go to court for 3 months and miss work only to have it finally dismissed). My boyfriend who was on probation answered the door. The police asked for his ID, went to the car and once they saw he was on probation they said they smelled alcohol and handcuffed him for violating probation. He was on his way to work... The police in this country use the illusion of protecting the citizens to stroke their egos and cause fights. Where does this position of law enforcer come from anyways? Why do the people who are supposed to be protecting us carry guns and weapons? Why do they set such a poor example of what it means to be a peaceful and good citizen? Thanks again, I'm excited to hear more of these stories and hopefully some reform will come out of it.	"Thank you for reporting these stories of corruption in season 3.

In season one and two you were allowed to come to your own conclusion because the story was put in front of you with facts that had been checked repeatedly.

They will ignore things that don't fit the political narrative they push. If the prison/judicial system is racist, based on statistics, then it is also sexist, as most inmates are male. Let's address this travesty. Or racism in the NBA. By population, white and Latino players are underrepresented. Obviously, those make no sense. Just as the leftist slant makes no sense.	but, you can’t escape the political leanings that slant the perspective.  They will ignore things that don’t fit the political narrative they push.

Adnan's story was incredible and every time we thought we had it figured out something new popped up. It was intriguing, frustrating, mind blowing, and very well done. Loved it and we listened to it twice. Second season...zero interest in what happened. Could not have cared less and what started to come through was the narrator/story teller's bias. Much less reporting on what is and and isn't and more reporting on what her thoughts were. Seemed very reaching, but there were a few nuggets of interest. Overall, wasn't impressed. Season three...good grief. Insanely bias reporting and when I go to this podcast the last thing I need to be hit with is more politics. Just finished episode three and it couldn't be more political if it tried. I'd say it's an even tie with reporting and opinion. She isn't telling a story here. She's trying to convince you of something. I'd say listen to the first season, then stop. Get back to stories and reporting the issues as they happened, not introducing your two cents behind every person you disagree with.	"My wife and I could not get enough of the first season.

I heard Sarah Koenig when she was a guest on NPR's Wait Wait and she came across as rude and bitter, she sounded as if her appearance on the show was under duress and she responded to Peter's questions as if she had a personal vendetta with him. Ok, could have been a bad day, on to Season 3... well, this sounds to me like a vehicle for Sarah Koenig to push her liberal agenda. I've listened to 3 episodes, so far the common theme is people breaking the law, not listening to instructions given by police and being processed thru the justice system. I don't think anyone would disagree that our justice system is broken and needs to be fixed. But to get that point across report stories where people who HAVE NOT broken the law have to unjustly navigate the system.	I listened to Season 1 and 2 of Serial and enjoyed the stories.

iHATED-IT	20180926T154620	2	Mkay	So after season one I had given this podcast a 5 star review. Now after season two and three I've taken stars away. Not because of the production value or reporting, which is very good, but because of the stupid comments made every now and then. Exp: Episode 1 season three is filled with your typical leftist dumb comments about feminism racism etc. For example, the host tells the girl who is being prosecuted for battery on a police officer something to the effect of, weren't you afraid of talking that way to a cop? And the girl responds, well no because I am a white girl. And the host says, I know exactly what she means. Then later on, come to find out the girl has a criminal record. So rather than reporting that she has been around cops for parts of her life and probably has become a bit jaded towards them this resulting in her not being afraid of speaking badly, the host panders towards racism. Give me a break. There are other examples too but this review is getting too long. Typical liberal reporting.	So after season one I had given this podcast a 5 star review.

Season 1 of Serial was the first podcast I dove into and now I’m hooked, especially to true crime podcasts. Amazing research and thought goes into every episode and season.

Yes, the theme is the Cleveland courts, but it's not one story told week by week. I long for the days of season one.	Season one was great. A deep dive into one story. Season two was a mess.

Marymaryhart	20180925T170048	1	"Sensational, Biased ""Journalism"""	What used to be a fantastic, evenly reported and researched podcast has become nothing more than tabloid journalism. Koenig is more concerned about convicted criminals being spoken to nicely at their sentencing than actual justice. The victims are completely forgotten, or often times, not even mentioned. Koenig reports as if these criminals have no free will and should be given a hug and told to do better. It's a shame what this podcast has morphed into.

Moldy Taco	20180925T165202	2	Great Content, But World View Shaped By Racial Groups	"I loved the first two seasons of serial. Amazing content, good audio, and just overall fantastic stories to listen to. I've listened to the first two episodes of the third season and they are riddled with comments about racial groups and the narrators belief in their supreme importance in the justice system. Comments that lay out the racial make up of the judges, and who they preside over in their courtrooms. Do racial groups factor into how cases are decided? Yes, but the comments made by the narrator make it seem as if racial groups are the most important factor. That a white Irish catholic judge is not an individual, and that he or she can't possibly judge a case fairly that involves black people. I'm very disappointed in the comments made throughout these two episodes of season three, racial groups are made up of individuals and that's why we all have different names. Otherwise you might as well as just call people by their race and sex, ""black man, or Asian woman"". This world view is childish, and slanderous to the individuals in the story who get labeled as ""old white men"" with no comments to support the claim that they aren't fairly presiding over the cases before them due to race. Not once did they pause to clarify what they were trying to say, just threw out racial comments flippantly."	I loved the first two seasons of serial.

I have to say that I'm so dismayed that the justice system or even society at large doesn't have a basic understanding of how the human body works. The young woman in question was in fight or flight mode; it's an automatic response designed for such an occurrence as a bar fight. At that point she is on auto pilot. Of course she probably did not hear the cop. Her nervous system was too busy protecting itself. At that point the cortex is not really engaged so irrational thought goes out the window temporarily.

Irol Treve	20180924T215424	1	Politically Biased	Season 1 was a great listen. I was mesmerized from the first episode. Then came Bergdahl in season two. What a perfect topic for the host to make her political bias undeniable. This man is a traitor and is responsible for the deaths of other soldiers. Sarah, however, seemed to justify his actions. I could not listen past the first episode. Now, season 3. Sarah starts out sounding appreciative that the Cleveland courthouse allowed her full access to courtrooms, lawyers and attorneys. She ends up talking very negatively about them all. A judge who admonished young criminals for having children they couldn't care for was reported to an outside agency. What a coincidence this happened while the Serial crew were there. Sarah talks with criminals post sentencing—belittling judges and making a mockery of the whole process. Her need to state her political beliefs supersedes her desire to host an interesting, unbiased podcast. She forgot (or never knew) listeners want to hear a story, not her political opinion.

Nothing wrong with having your own opinions, just didn't expect it coming from serial. They told the cases in a clearly biased view, aka single out white male judges that are bad and make sure they are seen as the norm, lift up the black female judges that are good and make sure the contrast between them is seen (even though it's a sample size of maybe 3 or 4). Exactly what they hate people doing in the opposite form. Side note: Does the narrator know that being acquitted isn't the equivalent of being proven not guilty? It just means the crime couldn't be proven BEYOND a reasonable doubt. (Hello OJ ha)	"Love the prior seasons so much, hate hate the loss of unbiased opinion in the third.

So hating on Irish and Italians 100% fine. Disgusting that Irish and Italians are STILL being treated this way and if we were Jewish she would approve. Awful. Beware.

It's very disheartening to keep hearing how black people are the only ones getting in trouble. Or at least prosecuted. Bs. Sick of it.

I liked season 1 and 2 because we got facts and the feelings of all sides involved. I'm 2 episodes in and I'm hearing we should disregard law because woman and statements that a probation condition is unconstitutional....whereas I can't find anything in the constitution that supports this. I'm here for the story, not NPR's opinion. I'm giving 2 stars only because the first season was great. I am now unsubscribing.	I know it’s a shocker, NPR has a liberal agenda.

CJFranc	20180911T090716	5	This Podcast Changed My Mind	So I never liked listening to murder mystery stuff. And I've always loved books and audiobooks but fiction was my favorite. I stumbled across this podcast and was completely enraptured by the first season. The way Sara told the story so that it felt like you were discussing it with a friend. And she often had the same feelings I did while listening to the information as it unfolded. It was interesting and fun to listen to. And I think it's interesting because of the way it's presented. It's not just rambling. It's a story, a true story like the ones we'd have with friends around a kitchen table.	So I never liked listening to murder mystery stuff.

It made me uncomfortable because I have listened to many very well done podcasts where there was only fact and a conclusion based on fact. I did some research and it clear that there was evidence left out, wrongfully reported or dismissed as regular teenage drama. Wasn't impressed. And to be honest it wasn't even that exciting. I recommend Up and Vanished. It's a good example of a host who is impartial and honest and not delusional.

It's not ever mentioned if they asked her what her regular schedule was at that time, did she have after school activities? Would she have even been home at 320? Did she have any younger siblings? I think it's entirely possible that someone else picked up, if it was a younger sibling who doesn't really know what to do with a phone they could have just held it there while someone talked on the other end and it could have been a butt dial so maybe they weren't talking directly to who picked up and if it's a kid I could see them just holding it a while or even if it was intentional- neesha was the first on his speed dial, teenagers hanging out smoking pot do tend to make random calls and say random stuff no matter who answers. Or the kid could have gone to get the parent since they don't really know what to do with phone calls and by the time the parent came to the phone, jay or whoever was on the end of adnan's phone hung up. The thing that really makes me think this isn't a smoking gun is that neesha mentions then being at a video store calling her, she doesn't mention if they only called her once or if it was a regular occurrence but she's specific on them being at the video store and the ways it's talked about seems like a single occurrence. At trial when neesha mentions the video store they jump in and ask her to skip past that and just say what they talked about. Jay didn't start working at the video store until after hae's death. It's not clear if neesha ever says she's not sure what day they call her, but it seems like they say it matter of factly to her- tell us about this call, this call that came on that day, and maybe she just told them about the call and assumed they were correct on the day. They talked to her over a month after it happened, in the in the dark podcast they talk to a lot of witnesses who testified they saw the person on a specific day but when asked later say oh I saw them all the time I have no idea if it was that day, or oh I saw them sometime that month or that summer but I have no idea when. That's a large margin of error. I think the neesha call that neesha testifies about happens after hae's death bc she's very specific about them being at the video store and her story doesn't change. Did the defense/could the defense get the phone records? I know they got them for that day but could they get them for the whole month/the month after, if there is another call to neesha then it can't be said with certainty that the neesha call happened the day that hae died.

It reads like a college essay that was written at the last minute; full of holes, unnecessary data and information, and some things just made up entirely. At no point in Season 1, did Adnan Syed seem anything less than guilty. Koenig just did her best to try to make the story seem interesting, when it was really just a straight-forward case. Adnan is guilty. Koenig had to make up a story. That's all there is to it.	Sarah Koenig is a journalist at their worst.

Tremanator	20180616T181849	1	"Major Drop-Off, So Much ""Meh"""	As a fan of the original, the first episode of Season 2 was incredibly boring. I didn't know what I was expecting, but that wasn't it. The second episode was a little bit better, but mainly just confirms that the Angry Americans who *hate* Bergdahl are pretty much justified in their feelings. Getting first-hand accounts of what sort of resources were spent searching for the missing soldier was important. I came in thinking he was just a knucklehead who should be ignored by history, but now I hate him, too. Why? Because not only were lives and taxpayer dollars lost because of his stunt, but also because resources were wasted by Serial to tell his story.

Charming guys are not always guilty but just because he is charming doesn't mean he is innocent (anyone remember Scott Peterson?!). I'm not sure if he is innocent or not but this podcast did not help bring light. Sarah allowed this guy to play her emotions the whole time.	I had heard rave reviews regarding this podcast.

However, I couldn't help but feel it was either forced indecisiveness, or just a bedrock of delusion that drove the narrative. I couldn't enjoy it, not season 1. Not after some very very solid red flags, and just an almost petty nitpicking attitude that just disregards the heart of the case.

Jonathan Gladding	20180102T134124	4	Fascinating. One Complaint	Serial takes in-depth reporting to a new level. Really good. My only complaint is Sarah Koenig's occasional and unnecessary use of profane language. It's unprofessional and a little off-putting. Occasional profanities from interviewees is kind of expected these days but from the journalist it just doesn't make sense, especially from one as good as Sarah Koenig.

Purchase regret	20180124T020816	5	Wow! Teaching! Thought-Provoking!	Season 2 of the podcast Serial is quite possibly one of the most interesting, thought-provoking stories I have ever encountered. It delves into Bowe Bergdahl's story, and it's so complex with several layers so well told and considered from all angles. You not only learn about him, but you learn emphatically that things are not what they seem, we should not rush to judge others and the members of our armed forces are making under-appreciated sacrifices the depths of which we will never fully understand. Highly recommend!	"Season 2 of the podcast Serial is quite possibly one of the most interesting, thought-provoking stories I have ever encountered.

The second season was all of these things, though it just wasn't for me. No need to take off stars for personal preference, just give it a go if you enjoyed the first season.

Irish Sharky	20180113T064859	5	Insightful	I liked season 1, it was a case where I am not confident in guilt or inoccence. Season 2 was very edicational as I am in the military and did not know much about the case. Fox News (though I am a conservative- I lost when Trump was elected too) does report exaggerated, misleading and just untrue stories so it was confusing. I did not like S-Town. That was just bad. That made me not want to listen again. I hope they come up with something better for season 3. I do not think S-town is season 3 of serial.

Well done.	Koenig is great but she tends to grossly bypass important pieces of the case that seem obvious to listeners.

Bytor123	20171012T100835	1	Crash And Burn	I have listened to the first season of Serial 5 times just to make sure I heard everything. The story was sad and weird and stupid and interesting all at the same time. That's why people loved it. I think the Rumors episode was completely unnecessary but that's just me. Also, I don't think Sarah should have played recordings of Adnan as much as she did. That being said, I had zero interest in season 2 and season 3 is suppose to be about some stupid band called Fugazi that nobody's ever heard of! Pretty sad. Apparently Sarah Koenig can't handle fame. What started off as something special has turned into a dud. Bummer for us.	I have listened to the first season of Serial 5 times just to make sure I heard everything.

I like how in depth the podcast was in looking at the situation from different angles as well as remaining balanced in the stand on Bowe's dustwun. I would not recommend it though, it was OK for me.

Gomez7270	20171006T124535	5	1St Season Is Greatest Series In Podcast History.	"The first season of Serial was better than any other podcast by far. It had every single desirable trait in crime mystery. I was on a 7 hour road trip, miami to tallahassee, and i arrived at my home after 7 long hours only to wait in my car for 15 minutes to finish the series. So good. I wouldn't listen to the second season, if i was serial i would untarnish the perfection of season 1 by renaming the second season ""Bout bo"" and making it a whole different podcast. They were different podcasts and in no way are comparable. Season 1 5 stars. If we are comparing season 2 to season 1, no stars, if we are comparing it to other podcasts, 4 stars! Serial should only be about adnan or stories similar."	"The first season of Serial was better than any other podcast by far. It had every single desirable trait in crime mystery.

redbird.iphone	20171006T165835	1	Bad Decision On Topic For Season 2	Season one was engaging enough to try the second. I could not stomach listening to this deserter. Nothing interesting about him or the lies about his failed life—no matter what angle they took while interviewing him—the harder they tried to make it interesting, the harder it was to listen. One of the biggest scabs on the past adminsitration is the exchange of five Taliban chiefs for this failed figure.	Season one was engaging enough to try the second.

"I binged watched ""Making a Murderer"" and found the case of Mr. Avery very compelling - and was fascinated by the trial and investigation, leading me to be convinced of his innocence. Adnan is 100% guilty. I'm saddened that he is glorified in this series. What is the controversy? What is the goal in creating this? Serial glorifies a man who had clear intent to murder, and during interviews seems to have no remorse for the victim's death, but rather has more concern about what other people thought of him? I'm disgusted."

I was enamored in episodes 1 and 2. By 3, I felt like I was getting pulled in a bunch of different directions with no major plot twists, and by 4, I quit. When cases like this are dug back up, I hope the storytelling is leading in a direction that proves something shockingly different from what was decided in court however many years ago. Instead, this just all led up to potentially the same exact verdict that was already decided.

nhdubliner	20170920T160650	2	For Goodness Sake	The show was decent the first season though blew up in ratings and audiences had wildly unrealistic expectations on what to expect. But the subject matter in the second season turned into a defense of Obama's questionable moves re the return of a possibly traitorous soldier. If you like the bias of NPR, this is for you. Some conservatives in the room would help these guys a lot, they're hopelessly lost when it comes to any idea not formulated and approved within a very specific urban setting. It's too bad because a balanced story this in depth with this talent could really capture the entire populace.

The Mog Rules	20170912T202015	1	Season 2 Was Awful And Hubris Is To Blame	What started a revolution in podcasts turned into an exercise in hubris. Season one had an interesting story and a cast of charachters that were developed over time because no had ever heard of them. I feel like the producers were so pleased with themselves that they felt like they had to attack a headline everyone knew and that was their downfall. Instead of repeating a successful approach they felt like they had to jump to the top level when that's not what made Season One work. It's too bad but perhaps they can turn it around for season three. A little dose of humility from the abject failure of Season Two may help keep them grounded. It was awful.

It's painful to listen to her laugh and make uncomfortable jokes in tough situations. She sounds like a young and uninformed fan rather than a dignified journalist.

I finished the first season in 24 hours because I couldn't stop listening. The first season, which is about a murder, really made me question humanity and the justice system. The lead investigator, so-to-speak, is articulate, asks interesting and important questions, and is thorough in her work. I loved feeling like I was investigating the case with her because she presented it chronologically as she discovered things. I've just started the second season and I love that it's about an entirely different case and even issue, not murder. It is still captivating. Highly recommend.

While this podcast immediately captured my attention and is an intriguing mystery, I have come to learn that it also resulted in more grief for the poor girls family and fortune for the possible murderer. If this story were fiction I would be ok but it is not. This was an exploitation that resulted in hurting real people and I feel sad for the family. My sense is many people lost sight of that and after reading in the news the reaction from the family I decided to erase the remaining episodes from my library.

The later episodes didn't have that addictive quality. Before you commit around 12 hours of your life to this you should know..... THERE IS NO RESOLUTION! You listen to 12 episodes just to end up in the same place you were after the first few episodes. That doesn't mean it wasn't a great story, it was, but I'm not completely satisfied due to the lack of a final answer.	The first four episodes are spectacular.

Not as sensational and addicting as season one, but very relevant to our times, not at all political, and tries to tell the story from all angles. Their bias is there, but no one is completely objective, we wouldn't be human. Ultimately, this story seems more pertinent and rewarding than season one, if not as attention grabbing. Must listen... again.	"Another 5 stars for season 2.

Hdyjbf	20170629T221552	1	Nails On A Chalkboard	"I LOVE crime podcasts. I have listened to every single 48hours (by far the best) and a couple others that aren't as professional but very well done like ""Up and Vanished"". BUT, I really can't stand the narrators voice on this podcast. I am not sexist at all, but female voices tend to annoy me on podcasts. Maybe it's just her voice on here and the well known history podcasts. Unless you have customizable speakers in your car her voice will make you shoot yourself in the head. Crime podcasts NEED to be narrated by deep voices. The high pitch voice doesn't make you feel like you're listening to a spooked murder mystery. It sounds like she should be talking about fashion or lipstick. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND- 48hours though. And to prove I'm not being sexist I REALLY LIKE 48 HOURs, half the time Erin Moriarty is narrating and SHE DOES IT WELL. I respect this chick for making a podcast I thought I may want to listen to, but she should've had a man narrate it bcuz it's a crime podcast and needs a DEEP VOICE. NOT NAILS ON A CHALK BOARD"	"I LOVE crime podcasts.

This is a major issue with the entire podcast. Nobody else had the motive and this guy has had years to think about how to twist the story.	Sarah has a thing for Adnan and is easily played by him.

It's intriguing so it distracted me from running and it's insanely fun to listen to so I didn't mind going on a run since it meant I got to listen to Serial.

The only problem we have with this podcast is that it felt too drawn out and really repetitive. It seemed like a lot of the information was said over and over It seemed like all the attention was on Jay and there wasn't enough exposition about the other characters. The narrator, Sarah Koenig, we felt was partially biased towards Adnan and him being not guilty. We'd highly recommend this to anyone into mysteries and thrilling conspiracies.

It was like those stories where everything ends up coming in a full circle. I can tell Sarah was attempting to stay objective throughout the series and state strictly facts. However, at times, Sarah will say things that will make her seem more subjective either towards Adnan or against Adnan. Overall, this podcast was solid, 9/10 would recommend.

Moreover, it was a thrill to listen to the back and forth, believable and not believable, innocent and guilty. Not only the back and forth, the story is very engaging. As being a 17 year old Junior in high school I could easily put myself in anybody's shoes and wonder what would I have done or not have done. It's a constant mental battle, it's engaging and it reliable which is hard to find now a days. The narrator doesn't stop at only her opinion, but you will find she seeks out other expert opinions and people who knew the suspect and the victim. I was hooked till the end! I highly recommend!

Although at times the facts became repetitive and confusing due to jumping around from different time periods, locations, and facts, the narrator, Sarah Koenig, did present all the points of views needed for the listener to developed an opinion. The non conclusive ending is hard to accept, but the facts were well presented and researched.

Hannah Goodsite	20170522T181152	4	Review Of Serial	We would give this podcast a 4 out of 5 stars. The case was interesting, as there were many small pieces of evidence that made you think and reevaluate the state's case as well as Adnan's and Jay's stories. Sarah Koenig continually introduced new pieces of information and testimonies that progressively made the case undecipherable. However, it was very slow moving, as Koenig took time to describe each new piece of evidence and present the implications that each piece of evidence provided for Adnan. Though, by doing this she oftentimes caused us to stop paying attention and lost our interest. While the storyline was riveting, it oftentimes was slow moving and for this reason we award 4 instead of 5 stars.	We would give this podcast a 4 out of 5 stars.

She is great at not letting it get mondaine and boring. I hope she does more stories in future podcast!	I could listen to Sarah all day.

But after I had made it through a few episodes, it became less of an assignment and more of a ""I have to keep listening because I want to know what is going to happen"" deal. The podcast is definitely not for all people however (hence the 4-star rating). It can definitely be a bit slow in parts. In addition, the lack of a strong ending may really put some listeners off from TAL. But in the end, I would surely recommend this podcast to almost anyone."

Bravesrule22	20170522T131640	5	Best. Podcast. Ever.	This podcast was so riveting and entertaining that I could not stop listening. The investigation is very well thought out and very detailed so it is easy to follow and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It exposes the injustices that were predominant in the trial of Adnan Syed, the Muslim male accused of murdering Hae Min Lee. Sarah Koenig brings up many points in her argument including inconsistencies in the accusers story, inconceivable timelines, and investigation bias. I would recommend this podcast to those that are fascinated by criminal investigations but would advise to anyone listening that it is emotional at times because of the deep content.

Candace awesomeness	20170521T164917	4	The Gray Surrounding Jay	My group would like to give Serial a 4/5 because we found Adnan's case very interesting. There really is nothing like it. Listening to each episode left us wanting more, and also made us want to be involved in investigating the case ourselves. We definitely recommend listening to this podcast, if you don't, you are missing out. We deducted a star because it seemed to us that Sarah Koenig became too attached to Adnan and the idea of his innocence. We think that the attachment could have been an obstacle to Koenig accurately presenting the facts to the listener.

Akash, Baylor, Noah	20170521T022843	4	Great Podcast	The story starts off a little slow with a type of convolution of characters thrown at you. However, past the initial confusion, the mystery quickly draws in listeners. The buildup of presenting new evidence helps listeners understand the tension and eager feelings of Koenig, and quickly divides opinions on the verdict of Adnan's innocence or guilt. This aspect of the podcast is extremely unique and is the first instance of technology that stimulates intellectual conversation between such young people. This type of entertainment could be the start of a new culture that dominates leisure.	The story starts off a little slow with a type of convolution of characters thrown at you.

Tatortots15	20170518T144039	5	Fascinating And Captivating!	Serial was a compelling and thorough presentation of the evidence of Adnan Syed's case. It causes you to continually change your opinion on who the guilty person is while making you to reflect on our country's court systems and the possibility of wrongful convictions. The whole podcast follows the logical and mostly impartial guidance of Sarah Koenig who conducts countless interviews with friends and family of Syed, phone calls with Adnan in the Maryland Correctional Facility, and a reinaction of the day of the murder. Koenig guides you through her own personal struggle of who actually murdered Hay Min Lee while gaining assistance from investigative teams who are trying to turn over more evidence. This easy-to-listen to and addictive podcast keeps you intrigued and thinking deeply.	Serial was a compelling and thorough presentation of the evidence of Adnan Syed’s case.

nuggetlover99	20170516T150621	4	It'S Like Getting 12 Chicken Nuggets When You Ordered 8	The podcast Serial represents a greater cultural transition in which the lines between journalism and entertainment are blurred. In an era of Dateline, American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson, and 48 Hours, Serial expands the genre into a new medium, one that is an exclusively auditory experience. This sort of storytelling affects the story itself, making interviews and personal accounts more compelling. Overall, the podcast is effective in providing a fast-paced, binge-worthy, and thought-provoking narrative that the vast majority of the podcast's listeners genuinely enjoy. The detractors of Serial generally feel that the investigation does not follow the norms of ethical journalism and does not respect private information of the community in question. In traditional criminal inquiries, morality of the search is of the utmost importance as entertainment value is not considered. Similarly, in a conventional criminal case, privacy is sacrificed but the information gathered is not broadcast to uninvolved audiences. These concerns, paired with the effectiveness of the podcast's storytelling, make for an impressive cultural phenomenon with some valid criticisms.

Every episode had new information that was pertinent to the case. The story was organized very well, with each episode focusing on a single topic or section of the crime. We were all very excited to get the end of the podcast, but we are said to say that we were disappointed. The ending raised more questions that it answered. Overall, this was a very good podcast. We recommend this to all people who are interested in real crime mysteries, just be prepared to not have all the answers in the end.

Most people see convictions and assume the authorities got it right, and this just goes to show that sometimes you have to ask questions- lots of questions- in the name of justice. Sarah is a delight to listen to, not all podcasters of journalists are easy to listen to. She is effortless in her speaking and it sounds natural, like I'm talking on the phone to a friend. Seems silly... but it makes for more enjoyable listening! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.	Absolutely outstanding! The mixing, the score, the delivery and most importantly the STORY.

4clarks	20170515T223935	5	Captivating	From the start I was deeply engaged with the podcast and binge listened to all twelve episodes and the additional case files. Every episode lead to a different viewpoint or a new fact that could turn the case. As the story unwinds, new interviews, information, and questions arise that lead you to question every person put under the microscope. Stories told by people 20 years later help to shape the story and what could have actually happened with Hae Min Lee. As you get to the final episode, you have to decide who you want to believe, Jay or Adnan. I would recommend this to anyone willing to listen.

Realize that what you knew before was incomplete and was a sound bite and you will learn a lot and find that you knew less than you thought you knew. Excellent podcast and I can't wait for season 3.

Even by the end, I couldn't have cared less about the victim, Adnan or any other participant. And spoiler alert, FWIW, I think Adnan is guilty as hell.	It's ok - just ok.

cassiewilcox3	20170408T031835	4	Highly Recommend Season 1	If you don't know Adnan's story, Season 1 will be a highlight of your podcast listening life. Season 2 is grossly underwhelming. Thought not entirely their fault. Less prep time with high demand for a second season in the series and obstacles of government classified docs. I'd listen to Season 1 and with Season 2 concede that you never like movie sequels as much as the first either.

Throw me a frickin bone here	20170401T205351	4	Engrossing But...	"Firstly I have to say this is an absolutely captivating podcast, as I would expect from This American Life; however, there are some very dissatisfying elements that leave one wondering at the aim of the show. Serial does an incredible job hooking listeners into the life of Adnan Syed, an American teenager of Pakistani descent who was convicted of killing his ex girlfriend in the late 90's. The show dives through the twists and turns of the case interviewing different people involved, hiring experts to speculate over the details, and constantly debating the innocence/guilt of the perpetrator. This is all fine until the ending episodes of the show, where the momentum of the plot exhausts itself into a ""We'll never know what really happened"" kind of conclusion, which makes sense but leaves you wanting more. What I find inexcusable however is the noticeable bias towards the innocence of Adnan and the strain this must put on the poor family of the victim. The key witness, Jay, was able to lead prosecutors to the car of the victim, which no one could find, and put himself at risk to testify against Adnan, albeit with large inconsistencies. All and all this is a gripping show but has no regard for the wishes of the family of Hae Min Lee, and is essentially a 10 hour exhibition of a reporter who wants to play detective with people's lives on the radio."

MylesBSCfootball	20170323T031359	1	Unfortunately Biased	I found myself instantly hooked by the subject matter of season 2, but after only a few episodes it became clear that this wasn't going to be an unbiased take on the matter. The presenter goes out of her way to only focus on what she believes and feels, brushing off any other conclusions rather distastefully. I made it through the season in its entirety and the only thing worse than her bias is the fact that there is no attempt to put a conclusion at the end of the season. The season just....ends with a patter. This podcast is akin to a cheap firework show, starts off with bright colors, loud bangs, and then suddenly just dies. If this topic interests you, then you're better of reading, listening, or watching elsewhere. Form your own opinion, rather than have the presenter of this podcast try to nudge you into her's in this boring podcast.

An amazing podcast that is well worth the listen. Sarah's reporting is absolutely gripping and had me so keen to listen to the next episode. I would sit down and tell myself that I would just listen to one episode, but that would lead to another and then another. I highly recommend.

Slightly less impressive so far simply because they are re-using interviews with Bergdahl, but I am hopeful that she may get an interview... eventually. Either way, especially as someone who was in the Peace Corps in Turkmenistan as well as an NGO worker in Iraq, I am thrilled to see all the work that's gone into the context needed to understand a lot of this case. So proud of the reporting down here. Bravo and more please! :clapping_hands::light_skin_tone:	Have finally gotten around to listening... and am utterly addicted!

Nrt508	20170307T185218	3	Ok With Flaws	I'm so late to the Serial game - I loved the gripping story but I have a few complaints. First, they are not very respectful to the victim or her family. I get that they didn't want to participate and I think Adnan is also a victim but he is alive versus the true victim of the murder. The second season was super bland and I couldn't continue.

NicCalhoun	20170306T223421	3	Season 1-Yes! Season 2-Nah.	I fell in LOVE with this podcast during season one. I've actually listened to it several times. The story was engrossing, the investigation by Sarah and her team was smart and witty. But season 2 was a huge letdown. The story of BB was just a bad choice to follow up the salacious narrative of Adnan. Adnan's story was captivating and scandalous. BB's was just mildly interesting. I stopped listening after the 4th episode. Hopefully season 3 will bring a better, more thrilling story back. If not, I probably won't listen again.

Pointy Wand	20170131T232651	5	Entertaining And Hooking	This was an entertaining podcast that hooked me from the first episode. The narrator efficiently conveyed the facts of the case necessary to understand the whole situation. She used every episode to discuss a different idea from the case, which avoided confusion from the audience. The narrator plainly stated the facts of the case, and although she added some of her own opinions, she left plenty of room for speculation. On the whole, I thought it was worthwhile to listen too and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	This was an entertaining podcast that hooked me from the first episode.

KaseyDrew	20170102T211232	5	Like A Good Book, Can'T Stop Listening!	Serial is one of the best podcasts I have listened to. I started with the second series and was excited to learn about the first one. I hope there is more coming in the near future. Her voice is soothing, and her vocabulary is unlike most people in today's world. I have one question about the first series. Why wasn't Jay ever investigated? He made up his own alibi, and then his story changes... I go back and forth too about who I think is and isn't guilty in that case, but Jay's part/story is always questionable to me.

I got very swept up in the story and loved listening from week to week. The second season did not grab my attention, and after listening to about seven episodes, I gave up. This had more to do with the topic of the season, not the way that the podcast was created. I just did not care about the storyline. Hoping that Season 3 brings something new and exciting!

One episode made you think he should definitely punished harshly, the next would make you question that. Another would make you feel sorry for him, yet another would help you feel the anger and frustration of those he served with. Thought-provoking, well-told story.	Loved season 2!

A bunch of teenagers, faulty memories, inconsistencies... But towards the end of the series, a picture emerged of one that pointed to Adnan as guilty. True, Jay probably lied (as he was known to) about the details of the afternoon but the fact that he never wavered from the fact that Adnan was the killer and his fearfulness for his girlfriend's safety made me believe his basic testimony (if not the details). It's also supported by ""Kathy"" who thought the two acted suspiciously while at their house. Also, Jay was admittedly stoned - how accurate could his details be? It's unfortunate that Sarah Koenig bought into his innocence and brought on the Innocence Project. Why couldn't she see that Adnan killed Hae, not at the Best Buy parking lot but somewhere else? There will now be a new hearing and it's possible that a guilty man will walk free."	"This was the first podcast that riveted me in the sense that I couldn't stop listening.

Mbf55887766	20161023T164626	2	Season 2 Review	Poor choice on topic. Lost interest after a few episodes. You have to care about the main character to stick with such a series and I lost interest in Bo. Maybe there is just better investigative podcasts and this is just falling to the bottom of the heap. I am opening to listening to season 3 to see if a better topic is picked.	Poor choice on topic. Lost interest after a few episodes.

Max the Queen	20161020T070127	4	Season 1: Great Season 2: Lame	I loved season one of this podcast. Very addictive with a murder mystery and the interviews and newfound evidence. Even though at end you still feel on the fence about everything. Season 2 is horrible. So boring and uneventful. It's about that army deserter who was rescued and brought back here. The whole thing is recorded convos between two men and Sarah narrating randomly. Who cares about a deserter? Trying to prove he wanted to walk 20 miles to a different base. Makes no sense and just isn't interesting. They should have chosen another murder mystery. Anything to do with the military can never be exciting because you'll never get all the info or evidence for something that happened across the world.	I loved season one of this podcast.

DeeCeefromBos	20160906T040442	3	First Season Super-Strong, Second Season, Meh	The first season of Serial was fantastic. Couldn't wait for each episode. It was so hard to have it end with no resolution, but such is life! Even though it dealt with minutiae, cell-phone-tower pings, did this store have a pay-phone back then or no, did this person say it snowed versus say it was just poor weather, you get totally engrossed in it. I wanted to be as engrossed in the second season. The subject matter, Bowe Bergdahl and his possible defection versus capture by the enemy, was intriguing. And I did learn some fascinating things about US/mid-East relations. But I felt the series focused too much on the wrong things. Too much time was spent picking apart Bergdahl's life-story, his childhood, his personality, his habits/proclivities. Who cares, in the end? There wasn't much of a story here, in the end. I lost interest in him, and his choices, 3/4 of the way through.	"The first season of Serial was fantastic.  Couldn't wait for each episode.

Because of that time I was under the influence of the bait. I thought the podcast was going to deliver what it promised. I wonder how many would write positive reviews once they listen to the entire season. Basically it's a soap opera. You know how they do, every week they make you think you're going to learn something next week but you never do. You end up investing a lot of time I get nothing for it. You would never see a story that lead nowhere on 20/20 or Dateline. There's a reason for it. I'd feel better had I paid money and lost it than I do about my lost time. The problem isn't that people don't like it. The problem is that we were led on and lied to. TAL misrepresented what the podcast was about. Bait and switch.

It's a, let's start from the beginning, go to the present, go back and look at the past, and now think about the current situation and form your own opinion, kind of story. I find it so interesting to hear the thought process that goes on. It's real and it the moment.	I put off listening to Serial for a long time.

And I'm glad to say that I was wrong. This podcast is incredibly thorough without succumbing to stagnation or frustration. With controversy being at the heart of matter, they are very careful to explain the logic, understanding, and point of view of the various ""sides"" and people involved as best they can. While this might've become tedious, they do it in such a compelling manner that you often feel challenged to question your own assumptions. I can't tell you how many times my personal judgments have switched back and forth. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Well-researched/investigated. Thorough explanation.

I wanted some kind of mystery to consider week to week. If the soldier's motives were unclear throughout the podcast then it would have been more interesting. But, in the end it came down to his word vs. everyone else. And no one but him would know his motive. No mystery. We had all the answers from the beginning (at least all the answers we can hope to get). The remaining episodes were only somewhat interesting to me after that. Still, looking forward to season 3 and seeing what's next. More mystery please :) Deosn't have to be true crime...just don't give all the answers up front. Give me something to ponder each week.

She sounded biased from the start even though she tried to have a neutral opinion of Adnan. It's a good idea, though."

It made for fascinating listening at the time, but I just don't think it would be half as interesting for someone listening to the archives. My advice is wait for season 3 and hop on there. Season 1 is probably not worth backtracking to and season 2 went nowhere fast.	If you're reading this, seasons 1 and 2 have already come and gone.

Jdawgkilla	20160625T050138	2	Drop Off	After season one (which started very strong but weak), season two was a total disappointment. The storyline chosen was not nearly as gripping or interesting. Personally, I think Serial even knew this by almost trying to manufacture their own drama and inject it throughout with kitschy scripted phone calls that were clearly recorded in a sound studio, surprise court dates that weren't all that interesting, etc. Being perfectly honest, I stopped listening about 1/3 to 1/2 through the second season because it was so boring and forced. Will give season three another shot (if there is a season three).	After season one (which started very strong but weak), season two was a total disappointment.

To have sources ranging from upper level military to actual taliban fighters is remarkable. The story is very complex and interesting and I loved hearing all the different perspectives. When the bergdahl stuff first started up on the Jews I just felt like we were not getting the whole story. Thank you serial team for doing this. Look forward to the updates. I hope the court martial isn't as political as the rest of this story.	"So many negative reviews of season 2 and I couldn't disagree more.

Season 2 was a complete bust. Bo Bergdahl must be the least sympathetic (and least believable) subject ever, and there really isn't a mystery about what he did, just whether he was a deserter or misguided, self-deceived soul. To make matters worse, Season 2 is based on someone else's interviews with Bergdahl so the conversation and storytelling are fractured. Season 1 = 5 stars. Season 2 = 1 Star.

The tragedy was so gripping and the fabric in which Sarah and her team wove together created a very deep, very dense story that was a blast to listen to. Season 2 - The Journalism was great, the storyline in the beginning was nice too but, the end it just sort of lost steam... I found myself trying to finish the last 4 or 5 episodes out of obligation and not out of enjoyment. Maybe it had to do with Beau not being very likable... maybe I just felt like it went a few too many episodes... Maybe I just compared it unfairly to Season 1... Who knows.

The narrative was clearly thought out and masterfully put together. Season two? Feels like she didn't know what she was doing and procrastinated until the las possible moment. Although the choice topic of season two could have been the bigger issue. Either way it was the biggest let down I've had in years. Season one I could wait until the next episode was here, whereas season two the new episodes piled up and we're almost a punishment to listen through.	EVER!! Season one just really blew me away.

JB in DC	20160423T151614	5	Season 1 Hooked Me, Season 2 Kept Me Interested	Season 1 was unquestionably amazing. When I heard the first episode of season 2, I was quite disappointed. I had very strong opinions about Bowe Bergdahl and had no interest in hearing about his story. The only reason I continued listening was because I was already subscribed and I had exhausted all other content. I think it was episode 3 or 4 when I finally got into and started to appreciate the story. I'm glad I stuck it out.	Season 1 was unquestionably amazing.

Beallman	20160421T175422	5	The Big Kahuna Of Podcasts	If you listen to podcasts at all, you've almost certainly heard of Serial. Serial covers real world stories, told week-by-week (sometimes week-bi-week) in a serialized format. The first season covered a teenage murder trial from the 90s and season two just wrapped up covering the Bowe Bergdahl case. Both seasons delve deep into their respective stories, and keep you on the edge of your seat as the investigation's findings are uncovered. The show also has a knack for being thoroughly gripping. In the first season, host Sarah Koenig made dozens of phone calls to Adnan Syed, the subject of the season who was convicted for murder and is currently serving his sentence at a Maryland correctional facility. Listening to his story, listening to him claim his innocence, and then hearing Sarah dive in and try to uncover the truth is incredible to follow. Likewise, in season two, Sarah makes several phone calls to the Taliban — yes, THAT Taliban — all in the name of chasing the story. Rarely does a show become a phenomena in its own right, but Serial did it in one fell swoop. If you enjoy gripping real world storytelling, Serial is the show for you.

Alexalilbug	20160418T225009	1	Don'T Believe The Hype	I've listened to the first season, and gave the 2nd a try but only got to the 3r episode before I realized that I would not be able to trust Ms Koenig to deliver another in depth look into a socially complicated issue. The first season of serial, while engaging and entertaining, does not, I feel look carefully enough at the facts of the case. It does not consider seriously enough that the suspect and convicted murderer is actually guilty of the crime, despite the lack of motivation on behalf of all other suspects. Koenig spins the only witnesses as suspicious and faulty, and Mr Syed, guilty only of circumstance, as a young man grown ever more thoughtful after 15 (ish?) years in prison. I can't help dwelling on the connections she does not pursue that suggest Mr Syed is a true psychopath- incapable of feeling true guilt or regret. I would have liked more investigation on the scienc e of the crime, or a professional criminal psychologist interview. I can't take ms Koenigs interpretation of mr Syed's character, just as she couldn't from his family and friends. There is too much on riding on producing a good story, and not enough on the truth.

The first season I could not stop listening to,wish we knew more about what's going on with the trial, did he get a appeal, did they ever get DNA back.Feels like we are left behind with things undone.With that being said,I have tried and can not get into season 2. Seems there is to many podcast about politics right now and all the story's seem to be done and done again.Please bring back the feel of season one in the next season and a real mystery.

TeneBoo	20160416T134244	5	Season 2 Is Not That Bad	To me the appeal of Serial is the way the story is told. I went back and binge listened to Season 2 and appreciated more. When she mentions the zoom book in episode that is how you have to look at the whole story. The Serial team chooses controversial stories to tell. So even if you feel one way about what happened, you can't take away from it being well written.	To me the appeal of Serial is the way the story is told.

The story was great, the reporting was fantastic, and everyone at my work is still talking about it. When season 2 came around I was really excited to listen. When I heard what it was going to be about I got excited, I really enjoy hearing about politics and military stuff. I think it was in the execution where it was missed. I listened to the entire season just wondering when I was going to get sucked in hang onto every word, like I did season 1. That moment never came, I noticed myself zoning out a lot of the time and getting to try end and didn't really know what happened. I hope they come out with season 3 because I love the podcast, I just hope it's more like season 1.	Back when season 1 was on I couldn't wait for the new episode every week.

The suspense of season one is gone. The motley crew of characters is replaced with a pathetic subject and an assortment of fleeting people marginally involved. Sarah herself is clearly not passionate about this topic so the whole season feels flat. Episode after episode digs into the situation in Afghanistan, the taliban players and the military's feelings towards Bergdahl ad nauseum. I had a hard time getting though this or caring.

Awakethefallen	20160410T052543	5	Fascinating	"For the two ""Seasons"" it has aired, Serial has been a long-form story of a crime that has taken place. Each season covers one specific crime that has occurred over the course of ten episodes. In Season 1, we have the case of Adnan Syed, a person who has been convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. There are many things unresolved and questionable about the case that sent Syed to prison, so host Sarah Koenig, a former reporter in Baltimore, was brought in by a friend of Syed's family to take a look at the case to see if she could get to the bottom of the case once and for all. Season 2 of the show covered Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. If that name is not familiar to you, he is a US soldier who deserted his post and had been subsequently capturered and taken prisoner by the Taliban. So while the first Season covered whether or not there could be a definitive answer to the question of Syed's guilt, Season 2 covers the question of why did Bergdahl abandon his post and what the consequences of that action were. I prefer Season 1 of the show, I actually believe it is one of the primary reasons people are so fascinated by True Crime stories right now, with Making a Murderer following up Serial's success on Netflix. The did he/didn't he question of whether or not Syed killed his ex-girlfriend was a fascinating journey. To this day I flip-flop on what I think the answer to that question is. I don't hate Season 2 of the show like many, I think the question is interesting, there's just not as many twists and turns in the story as Season 1. Either way, I highly recommend checking the show out, it's great storytelling and I can't wait to see what Season 3 has in store for us."

In this case we know he did it - so it's a question of why. Well if you are interested in the case then who cares why. Plus the every other week format, I just completely lost interest. Just got lame. Not sure what happened but I guess understandably thats always the case right: always hard to make the sequel.	Season 1 was amazing.

Season 2 was circular and difficult to follow. I had a feeling season 2 was not going to live up to season 1 once they went to releasing episodes every other week. The story has not completely played out in real life so I think that could have contributed to the poor flow. Again, season 1 was well done I would highly recommend it.

ickimaj	20160401T200322	2	Season 2 Waste Of Time	"Soooo disappointed in Serial Season 2. The story did not warrant a full season, nor did having a full season of Bowe's story clarify or highlight ANYTHING. Just a long, boring, repetitious ""gossip fest"". I listened to every painful moment of it, in hope that the storytelling would become interesting and insightful. But, no. It NEVER happened. No need to listen to Season 2. You will not discover anything you can not read in a two paragraph summary of the incident anywhere else online.

First season was riveting and I didn't know what to expect about this season regarding such high profile case, but I send my kudos to the team for unveiling the complexity of the cost of a war and digging out so much information that are usually not available to public and as a result you get a elevated level of understanding what a war really demands of a nation as whole. It's another blessing of this Information Age to have access to inside information that were not available to perhaps WWII generation, but we would not have them if there weren't people like Serial team who has a mission and care to know the truth and not afraid of the hard work that's involved to get there. I truly appreciate your work! Nothing in this world is as simple as black and white.	"Just finished listening the second season.

I can only say congratulations to the entire staff of this podcast for the stellar story-telling and reporting. What sticks with me is how Sarah, Dana et al explore the grey of every single piece of Bowe's story and all the ramifications. I especially love that the staff sought out and found how the event — and the war as a whole — impacted his fellow soldiers. If the pursuit of journalism is to deepen our understanding of the news, human behavior and society, then the staff of Serial has stuck the landing.	Just finished last episode of Season 2.

AngusV	20160331T230710	3	Often Compelling	The long story arc of the episodes is engrossing and it will keep you coming back for more, but at the end of the season I find myself asking what I learned from the story. In both cases, it has been not much. I learned some facts and I was entertained, but I don't feel as though I learned a great deal about the criminal justice system, or how the military operates. It feels a bit more tabloid, even if the topics carry more weight than that. The S1 updates from the courthouse were unlistenably annoying. It felt like being subjected to the gossip and banter of sorority sisters after one went on a date to watch a day's testimony in court. Please, don't do that again!

Lefty Liberal	20160331T160332	3	Fall In, Fall Out....X50	"This is some of the most biased reporting I have ever heard...and not biased in the sense of ""Right Vs. Left"". This really comes down to people who take accountability for their actions and those who don't. When I was in basic training, on a blistering hot summer day, my flight was ordered to ""fall in"" (we had to run from our barracks and line up in formation outside and stand at attention until given the command to ""fall out""). The officer who issued the ""fall in"" would sheepishly walk away, or engage another officer in conversation while a 3rd officer would approach us and say, ""Fall out!"". This happened 50 times in a row in one day. My entire time at basic training was like this...""Tie your shoes"" ""WHO TOLD YOU TO TIE YOUR SHOES"". The point is two fold 1) it teaches you to follow orders, no matter what and 2) it re-inforces the fact that you will be given silly orders in the military, over and over, and some of those orders will contradict other orders, and totally waste your time. Bowe walked off base for two reason (reasons reported by the show). 1) He almost lost his life and instead of ""nice job"" he got ""why haven't you shaved. 2) He got yelled at because he was told he could take off his vest in the heat while digging, and later got in trouble for it. We've all seen ""Born on the 4th of July"", we've all read ""Johnny Got His Gun"" and ""Catch 22"". We all know going in that military service is likely to kill us, and we might die because of a silly order, or a bad commander, or a contradiction in orders. The other argument the show makes is, Bowe shouldn't be punished because he already paid his dues because he spent 5 years in captivity. This is the most childish argument in the history of reporting. If I drink and drive, hit someone and their leg is amputated because I was DUI, but in the accident I was paralyzed...By Koenig's logic, my dues have been paid, and I shouldn't be punished. We have a generation of Americans who don't understand that actions in life have consequences. Sarah can argue until she's blue in the face that Bowe's AWOL didn't kill anyone, but it doesn't matter. Bowe walked off base, and that is a punishable offense - regardless of how many years he was captured. The military takes a dim view of going AWOL because if they let a few kids get away with it because they didn't like their CO's, we'd have anyone who didn't like getting yelled at walking off post because their feelings got hurt. Sarah goes to great lengths to show that the Army made a mistake by allowing Bowe to reenlist after his Coast Guard breakdown...while totally ignoring that Bowe signed the papers, Bowe is an adult, Bowe enlisted without anyone twisting his arm. Zero, zero personal accountability. The very worst thing our military can do is give Bowe a pass for his crime. When he is convicted, they should use his story in recruiting offices as a warning...put a poster of him in every office with a caption that reads, ""You Walk Away, You Pay"" or ""Horrible Living Conditions IS NOT a reason for leaving your post""."

This is the most childish argument in the history of reporting.  If I drink and drive, hit someone and their leg is amputated because I was DUI, but in the accident I was paralyzed...By Koenig's logic, my dues have been paid, and I shouldn't be punished.

We have a generation of Americans who don't understand that actions in life have consequences.  Sarah can argue until she's blue in the face that Bowe's AWOL didn't kill anyone, but it doesn't matter.  Bowe walked off base, and that is a punishable offense - regardless of how many years he was captured.  The military takes a dim view of going AWOL because if they let a few kids get away with it because they didn't like their CO's, we'd have anyone who didn't like getting yelled at walking off post because their feelings got hurt.

Sarah goes to great lengths to show that the Army made a mistake by allowing Bowe to reenlist after his Coast Guard breakdown...while totally ignoring that Bowe signed the papers, Bowe is an adult, Bowe enlisted without anyone twisting his arm.   Zero, zero personal accountability.  

The very worst thing our military can do is give Bowe a pass for his crime.  When he is convicted, they should use his story in recruiting offices as a warning...put a poster of him in every office with a caption that reads, ""You Walk Away, You Pay"" or ""Horrible Living Conditions IS NOT a reason for leaving your post""."
Smrtini	20160331T152648	5	Loved Season 1!	The twists and turns of season one had me binge listening to this for days! I like Sarah's style and feel like you can easily identify with her thoughts and questions along th way. Season two just wasn't as appealing of a subject. I felt like you could have stopped listening after a few episodes and wouldn't have missed anything. Please find more stories like season one!

Lock-N-Load	20160322T231229	3	Season 1 Was Awesome, Season 2 Is Meh...	So Season 1 was awesome. The story was captivating, I got pulled in, the show was weekly, I cared about the characters involved, I couldn't wait to hear what happened and it just seemed more organized and in a timeline that made more sense week to week. Season 2.... it seems very disjointed and all over the place - at times I am not even sure what the podcast is about? Is it about the military and all of these boring interviews, or the media, or the president, or Bergdahl? I don't care about the main character or the story frankly as the podcast is not pulling me in. It's also just not that interesting of a story itself, podcast aside, not even close to being like season 1. And really, the choice to release a podcast every 2 weeks was a truly terrible idea. Why? Because in 2 weeks I kind of forget, I loose interest, it's too much time and so I drift away. I have iTunes setup to automatically download the latest episode, but due to all of this - I don't care that much. During season 2 they did some updates on season 1, those were more interesting to me sadly. Maybe it was to much to hope that they could follow an awesome season 1.	"So Season 1 was awesome.

Nick McNulty	20160317T173018	1	Confirmation Bias In S2	The true conflict of season 2 is between Sarah Koenig's pre-existing notion of the Bowe Bergdahl story and what she found actually occurred. It is clear that Koenig already had her mind made up that Sgt. Bergdahl was a valiant, conscientious objector who went AWOL in order to bring attention to army misconduct. Yet as the story progresses, all of her assumptions prove to be false. She attempts to blame the battalion for being mismanaged, the army recruitment process for allowing Bowe to serve, the GOP for blowing this issue out of proportion, his fellow soldiers for not being accepting, and America's short-sightedness for allowing this conflict to escalate. And by the end of every episode, there is a desperation to Koenig's voice as she realizes that none of her arguments hold any water. What she hoped would be a cut and dry story that reaffirmed her own opinions has proven to be the exact opposite; each episode shows that Bergdahl was a deserter with a bizarre moral code who returned home due to a politically-motivated trade. Perhaps the two-week gap between installments gives Koenig more time to try and discover more evidence that backs up her original POV, because every episode feels like more of a Hail Mary pass to justify Bergdahl's actions and the State Dept's decision to negotiate with the Taliban.

K Hoffblast	20160317T140953	1	Bo-Ring Berg-Dull	First of all, great puns by me. The Adnan case was exponentially more entertaining than Season 2. This season has devolved from the investigation format into an analysis on military and political procedure, two things which grow tedious when featured for more than a single episode. Bergdahl is also a completely non-polarizing figure. There is no justification for the actions he took, and a lack of mystery to his actions. Whether he went AWOL because of a justifiable reason or not was answered early in the season, thereby turning the season into a biopic (biopod?) which is far less interesting. Next season, please return to the original format of a polarizing case. The only thing polarizing in Bergdahl's case is whether or not he lied about why he left his post. We already know that he did it. It would be like if Adnan admitted to the murder, and the season was about his justification for doing it. There is no recourse for innocence, which was one of the main reasons season 1 had such a stranglehold on listener interest.	"First of all, great puns by me.

cso115	20160317T140306	1	Sneakily Left-Biased	I'm about as moderate as can be, which is why I loved this podcast at first. It always seemed to portray all sides equally. But the bias gradually peers through (mainly in season 2), slowly becoming the same liberal crap that I can't escape in any form of media. I don't know whether to blame the media or my generation (millenials), but I hate both equally. Very disappointing.	"I'm about as moderate as can be, which is why I loved this podcast at first.

Ervin04	20160317T125427	2	Let Down In Season 2...	The First season was fantastic, but I've got to say I'm very disappointed with the lack of objectivity in season 2. The reporting in Season 1 was done so objectively and without bias. Season two is the exact opposite! Sarah feels a certain way about Berghdal and his actions/intentions, and she is trying to force them and her political beliefs down the listener's throat. She even goes so far as to sympathize with Al Queda members. Big disappointment...	The First season was fantastic, but I've got to say I'm very disappointed with the lack of objectivity in season 2.

Lennae_Bear	20160316T184015	5	In-Depth 'Cast	"I love how in-depth this podcast is. It's obvious that production is meticulous and thorough. I'm usually disappointed with how lacking in information most segments on murder cases are. I've just finished ""Making a Murderer"" on Netflix, and Season 1 of this podcast filled the void. It's an interesting look at the validity of witness testimony and the justice system. Season 2 didn't capture my attention as much as Adnan's case, but that may be because I wasn't able to listen to Season 2 all at once. I tend to forget details about Bowe's story in between episodes. It's still an interesting story, but maybe for Season 3 I'll wait until I can listen to all episodes over a few days."	I love how in-depth this podcast is.

There is not enough mystery in why Bo left his post to keep me interested. Also, I don't understand why only one episode come out every two weeks when they are just adding one new perspective and remixing the previous episode, total lack of creativity on this one. .

There are a lot of complex details, especially in season 2, that SK decides she needs to cover. By this point in the series though it becomes an enormous data dump. The material isn't presented in a compelling fashion and the story isn't getting woven together in a way that is easy to follow. The tangent covered in this episode is incredibly important but save the details for another podcast. [SPOILER] Two minutes eluding to the amazing story about brokering peace would suffice to forward the plot without requiring I get out a notebook to draw maps and create character summaries. The great thing about season 1 was that I didn't have to be an investigative journalist to love the investigative journalism. This season, culminating in this episode, seems to want to appeal to her research team more than her audience.

ObabyXo	20160303T130603	2	Story Choice Could'Ve Been Better	This story is so much harder to follow than the first season. In my opinion, this story only appeals to people who closely follow politics and the war. I keep finding myself distracted during the episode and having to go back and rewind portions. We wait 2 weeks and then the episodes are full of these details that I'm sure are important to the story, but are painfully boring.

Fortunately, we had a long drive from the Bay Area to Lake Tahoe, and we almost got through the first season with as many twists and turns as the road through the Sierras. In reading through the reviews, it became evident the remaining episodes would be no different and without the proverbial money-shot at the end. I think this style of reporting is more entertainment then journalism and given that it filled the chitchat gap of driving for 8 hours, I would say it did its job.

Season 2 upended that with a post-start shift to every other week, and that's had a negative impact on the story flow about Bowe Bergdhal's capture. I wish they had maintained the schedule as promised, then added on bonus episodes as needed. Two weeks between episodes in a story this complex loses momentum, you forget details--it's simply not as compelling for the listener.

Kendraleexxx	20160219T135550	1	Poor Sarah	"I listened to Season 1 several times due to the terrific reporting and conflicting evidence and frankly the charm, intelligence and charisma of Adnan Syed. Season 2, about Bowe Bergdahl, fails for many reasons. First, he does make a convincing case for himself and it's just hard to keep listening when you feel that he was so reckless walking off his post. Second, Mark Boal was a terrible choice for an interviewer. He is flip, often drops the f-bomb instead of deploying a real word with meaning and robs the series of Sarah's skills as an interviewer. Third, Sarah seems much less professional in this series (i.e., her ""whateves"", her inability to release it on time and stick to the weekly release, then dropping two episodes in a row,, her reporting on the Syed hearing from a closet, etc.) I have given the podcast 8 episodes before reviewing to be fair. It is so disappointing. It seems such a strange choice of subject matter as the army is not known for nuance. There is nothing compelling here."

Ms. Koenig attempted to cover the most recent court hearing in Mr. Sayed's case, and not only did she do a terribly incomplete job, she didn't even make it to the final day of hearings! Why even cover the hearings if you couldn't do justice to the excellent work that was put in during Season 1. Serial has been absolutely trending downward since Season 1 ended.

I know this is difficult, being that you only relay his sound recordings, but there needs to be some more pathos appeal. Right now I just think that he is a rebel without a cause.

Season 2 I have no idea what she is even trying to discover? its like a biography of this guys capture in Afghanistan. Yes, he suffered. Yay he made it back! but why is this part of serial? it seems like she's just telling his story with no reason. At least they are covering the rest of adnans case. Thats the only thing that is keeping me as a listener.	"I LOVED season one. It started with a case and she was working towards finding the truth of this wrongful conviction.

tweetylover	20160211T065310	1	Season 2 = Boring And Disappointing.	The Season 2 story is not nearly as engrossing as Season 1. And now the increased time between episodes actually encourages you to care less about the story. The recaps on Adnan's hearing were not informative and the non-serious tone of the phone calls was extremely off-putting. Very disappointed in this series.

The story is very interesting with all the twists and turns, when new evidence or a new witness is introduced. When you finish one episode, you feel the urge to continue listening; like an addiction. Sarah's narration is pretty good as her voice is easy to listen to. You can tell there was a ton of research done to produce the podcast. All the negative reviews on here have a consistent theme - there's no ending and it doesn't quite satisfy one's murder mystery desires....that's because it's a true story. You can't change or make up a Hollywood ending to a true story. Sure, it's disappointing there is no clear cut answer whether he's guilty or innocent, but this is where YOU get the ability to make your own determination. I have recommended it to my friends and family, and I recommend it to you too.	The podcast is outstanding. It's exciting to listen to and very suspenseful.

Week by week, the story is told. In season one, it's the story of a young man in jail for murder; season two tells a more current story, that of Bowe Bergdahl. In both cases, it'd be easy to tell a skewed version of the story. Instead, information that's both positive and negative is delivered, and it's possible to change your mind multiple times throughout the unraveling of the story.

(rabia told her this). it seems like she is trying to spread doubt when the evidence is just not there in order to keep things exciting. misleading your listeners is wrong and not in the interest of justice.	i loved the first season of serial, and a lot of information has come out since then. i have been extremely disappointed in the misleading reports sarah has been giving considering all this new evidence - for example, describing adnan as stiff as a stone during his PCR hearing while knowing that he has been suffering from extreme back and neck pain.

But I'm learning so much about the inner workings of the Taliban, the relationship between Pakistan and the United States in the context of the ""war on terror"", how the United States handles soldiers' or journalists' disappearances, what it's like to be captured and tortured by the Taliban. The Bowe Bergdahl story is intense in and of itself, bringing together subject matter as varied as foreign policy to what happens to your humanity when you're tortured and held against your will for years. I'm not bored at all."	"I actually really like season 2. Many reviews have said it's boring because it lacks the central ""whodunnit"" mystery that defined season 1.

She's obviously a skilled story teller so it has to just be a poor subject matter. Listening to the same music and the same beats as the first season and then nothing happens makes it kind of comical. It's like a bad parody of itself. Sorry Sarah I really want to like it. I've even listened to a few episodes more than once (sometimes because I zoned out out of boredom and other times because I thought maybe I missed something happening). Then stretching it out to every 2 weeks. That can't be a good thing. And then the payoff was another snooze episode where nothing happens. At this point I would say maybe do less episodes and wrap this thing up in another ep or two. Maybe do the Making a Murderer story. There still seems like a lot more that can be explored there.

Glassesglam	20160129T013302	5	Fantastic For Gen Y	This is the new version of hard news for people in my generation who use the newspaper to clean their windows. Sarah is strong willed, insightful, and humorous. The stories she has looked into this far make me think, talk with friends, and really wonder about society I am in. I love that the seasons 1) follow a story and 2) poke questions about what the macro environment is that the story takes place in. It gets me thinking. She works remarkably well without having Bo talk this season thanks to his calls with Mark. It is truly seamless. Also, even though I was admittedly first disappointed with the lack of ending in Season 1, the people who are upset about t are acting a bit ignorant. The fact of the matter is that it was a legal case, and there are (nearly) NEVER clear answers as to who did it in a murder case that goes to the court, and to think there should be is ridiculous. Think-- it's still unclear whether OJ murdered the girl, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most closely watched stories of the American public in the 20th century. Sarah and staff, keep doing what you're doing because it's fantastic!	This is the new version of hard news for people in my generation who use the newspaper to clean their windows.

It was a more personal story that wasn't a global news headline. It shed light on a case most people weren't familiar with. The topic of Season 2 is already talked to death about on every cable news channel and website. Another problem is the bi-weekly schedule. It opens with ""Serial, a story told week-to-week"", but not anymore! After waiting 2 weeks I sometimes forget the details and become less engaged in the story."	The beauty of Season 1 was the scope.

I remember all the ""Bring Bowe Home"" signs and the arguments that shortly followed about him being taken prisoner, how and why sort of stuff. I'm not really finding it to be very mysterious or wondering what is going to happen next but, that's probably because I've followed the his story. Despite that, it's interesting to hear Bowe speak about his 5 years with the Taliban and all the other information that you most likely aren't getting in the news."

acuisle	20160124T161913	1	Not As Good	this season is so meh, last season was so interesting. this year's story i think is interesting to the people making serial, but as a listener there's no tension. i don't even know what questions i'm supposed to be asking right now. plus it's about something that took place in the military so they get people on the show who literally can't say what actually happened or things they did. also she isn't even talking to the subject herself so the listener has no real connection to him like we did with adnan. even if it gets better eventually there have been weeks of uninteresting buildup. disappointing compared to the debut and now it's only every other week. every time i get a notification about a new episode i feel like oh here we go, not excited at all. listen to criminal instead.	this season is so meh, last season was so interesting. this year's story i think is interesting to the people making serial, but as a listener there's no tension. i don't even know what questions i'm supposed to be asking right now. plus it's about something that took place in the military so they get people on the show who literally can't say what actually happened or things they did. also she isn't even talking to the subject herself so the listener has no real connection to him like we did with adnan. even if it gets better eventually there have been weeks of uninteresting buildup. disappointing compared to the debut and now it's only every other week. every time i get a notification about a new episode i feel like oh here we go, not excited at all. listen to criminal instead.

The global range of the story and the wide range of perspectives and informants is incredible. It's not as sentimentally engaging as the story of Adnan Syed, but it seems to me more consequential. Every week I come away wanting to read more about Afghanistan, US policy, the Taliban, Guantanamo, kidnapping, military policy, desertion, etc. It's excellent.

She's not moving mountains, saving worlds, or revolutionizing investigative journalism. Many, many radio personalities put time and work into their chosen passion.

With Season 1 I couldn't wait to hear the next episode and now I've completely unsubscribed. And especially with them moving to biweekly, what's the point?

Ecosoundssss	20160117T014130	3	Disappointed In This Season	"Was suggested to start with Season 1, which I did, and I loved it and was hooked. The Bowe Bergdahl story, while riveting, seems already like an unsuccessful departure from what was so captivating about Season 1. What made Season 1 so fascinating was her ability to comb through a mountain of evidence that was already out there to be re-looked at in a different light. What else was fascinating was the show's ability to instantaneously hook our attention on a guy most of us have never heard or read about. The Bergdahl case is high profile (departure #1 from S1) and actively going on right now (departure #2), so I knew right away that compromises were going to have to be made. And sure enough, 4 episodes in, it has become a bi-weekly podcast (departure #3). Also, she is ""collaborating"" with the filmmaker on this season, and that struck me as a bit lazy. The filmmaker has asked all the questions, done all the interviews, had all the conversations, and the audio is cut up and offered as fresh content. Season 1 was such an intense show of work and effort by the Serial crew, and that was aided by their ability to open up an old case. Even if they try, I feel like they won't be able to reach those heights with this case. I hope to be proven wrong."	"Was suggested to start with Season 1, which I did, and I loved it and was hooked.

But season 2 is just a story about a glorified crybaby narcissist that went AWOL. I'm very disappointed and can't wait for season 3. Hopefully it'll be better than season 2.	Season 1 was GREAT!

Heryqk	20160111T142123	2	Second Season Is Uninteresting	I think like most, i found the first season very interesting. While it had its flaws, the subject matter was intriguing. Season 2 is a different story. The subject matter is uninspired. I have no interest in Bowe Berghdal. Enough was said about his situation. I was hoping the season would leverage his story as a stepping stone in exploring the military system but after 4 episodes, it doesn't seem like it. Not sure how many more episodes can be made about Berghdal. Disappointing.	"I think like most, i found the first season very interesting. While it had its flaws, the subject matter was intriguing.

Season 1 catered to a certain audience (which turned out to be huge), which now seems to be largely disappointed with season 2. I think both seasons have their merits, but attract relatively separate audiences. The writers' decision to change paths like this is confusing. It will be interesting to see what is in store for the future of Serial.

Big fan of TAL and true crime but this series offers nothing other than highlighting details whose importance may have been downplayed during the initial investigation. It makes some valid points when analyzing the event and court proceedings, but offers nothing more than speculation, semantics, and open thought which makes something like this lose almost all of it's worth. Will try the second season hopefully they have more to go off of.	Really wanted to like this and probably was enjoying the first half of the series.

All year long I've been choosing different podcasts trying to get my serial fix and nothing did the trick. Unfortunately, so far, serial can't fix my serial fix either. I mean the only thing the two cases have in common is that they are criminal cases. I hate to give a bad review to this podcast since I am positive they have poured their heart and soul into the making of this season but, I am just not feeling it. I actually find myself losing attention when I do run out of other podcast and serial is the only one left and I have to try and force myself to listen :(.

LeighinCT	20160108T133804	2	Season 2 Disappointment	I was a huge fan of the first season. It appeared that Ms. Koenig presented both sides of the story with unbiased information. I was particularly excited for the start of season 2. Unfortunately season 2 has not lived up to the level of season 1. Ms. Koenig's neutral stance appears to have disappeared. She interjects her bias in a way that makes this listener feel like Serial has evolved into a platform for Ms. Koenig's one woman lobby to exonerate Bergdahl. The fact is Mr. Bergdahl abandoned his unit and in the process put many, many American lives in danger. The effort to bring him home resulted in loss of life. As the series has progressed I have hoped for more compelling information in support of Mr. Bergdahl. Unfortunately the show has evolved into a parade of excuses and regret on his part. I'm certain many people serving time for lesser crimes have regretted the lapse in judgement that resulted in their prison sentence. Nonetheless, regret does not absolve one of the crime. I hope to hear Series put forth more balanced compelling reasons to support Bergdahl. I'm not holding my breath.	I was a huge fan of the first season.

There is no doubt of the mess caused by Beau and his insane choices, nor is there doubt of his guilt in regards to the law. I cannot sympathize with him at all, and although I have listened to the first three episodes, have not decided whether to bother with the rest, unless Sarah can instill some interest soon.

OhSewCountry	20160102T015241	5	Serial - Year One	I got into this story way late (December 2015), but it was one of the most riveting and well narrated stories I've listened to on here . . . for FREE. Outstanding job to the staff of This American Life. I was left wanting a 13th, 14th and 15th episode. I listened to the last four traveling from Wilmington, Delaware to Silver Spring, Maryland and back, taking note of the exits listing the towns named in the story. Made a long, boring ride quite bearable.	I got into this story way late (December 2015), but it was one of the most riveting and well narrated stories I've listened to on here . . . for FREE.

SGags24	20151231T173042	4	Unanswered Questions.	I enjoyed following this story. Granted I am a little late to the game but I feel there are so many unanswered questions. Or I should say so many unasked questions. Maybe they were and I missed them but I find myself asking things that seem so obvious to me. I never heard of this case or podcast until a few days ago. I listened to the whole first season in two days so it is possible I missed some things. Did Jay really get Stephanie the gift? The bracelet he claimed to buy at one of the two malls he said he went to that day with Adnan? No security footage of them seen together at either malls? Jen says she was with Jay until around 3:45 pm which couldn't have put Jay at Best Buy at the estimated time Hae was killed. She says they met up after she was done work that day. Did anyone check that she was really at work that day? Did Jay and Adnan hang out after January 13th? If so why would you continue to hand out with someone who pulled you into a situation like this? How about after Hae's body was found. Between February 9th to the 23rd (the day Jen went to the police) did they hang out? Did Adnan not notice Jay stopped getting him pot or smoking with him? My guess is they didn't stop hanging out. Especially if the call with the girl Nisha happened after the murder when Jay was working at the video store. How about the payphone call that supposedly happened at Best Buy? There was the one conversation with the girl who frequented the Best Buy who shoplifted swore there was no payphone where Jay said there was. Was the original location (down the block from where her car was) Jay said Hae was killed located near a payphone? Did that match a cellphone tower near that location? I could go on and on. I wish I could discuss this with Sarah. Maybe some of my questions could be cleared up. My opinion... He didn't do it.. Or he wasn't alone. I think Jay and Jen were having a thing and maybe Hae threatened to tell Stephanie. And Jay and Jen killed her and blamed Adnan. Or if Adnan isn't completely innocent Jay helped Adnan more then he let on.	"I enjoyed following this story. Granted I am a little late to the game but I feel there are so many unanswered questions.

In-depth storytelling that made me feel like a part of the jury in a capital murder case. Season 2 takes some getting used to. It's investigative, but less dramatic. It's less of a thrill to listen to because there's little to no ""whodunnit"" factor. The bar is still set very high in terms of production value and quality of storytelling. It just doesn't have the spark that Season 1 had."	"I was hooked from the first episode of Season 1. In-depth storytelling that made me feel like a part of the jury in a capital murder case.

I left thinking that the person was innocent, and that there was much more to the story. The second season I am perplexed at how the show seems to sympathize with a man that abandoned his post and had men killed trying to return him. The woman says ""some say he is responsible for their deaths"", plays clips of Republicans demanding his court marshal and acts like they are cruel, evil people--the entire show portrays a traitor as the victim. Now that the podcast has revealed its political bias and skewed perspective, I'm done."	"I started listening the first season and loved it.

OpusB	20151229T225141	3	Great Concept But Poor Follow Through	I will admit I was hooked the first episode. This is a great podcast and it's put together well. The whole idea of running through a case like this is pretty great and I can only imagine how much work this this took. BUT, it is blatantly obvious the host is very poor at dissecting the evidence and gets hung up on tiny details that don't really matter to the case. You can really tell she believes Adnon is not guilty and she begins to sway the episodes in his favor of prosecuting Jay by herself. This becomes blatantly obvious in the 10th episode discussing the pay phone at Best Buy. Yes, that detail is cumbersome, but it clearly doesn't provide a pivotal moment in this case, yet the host is trying so hard to point out how this totally blows the case. I wish the producer would have reigned in the host and coached her on how to be more responsible in her reporting.	I will admit I was hooked the first episode.

Be prepared to feel exactly the same you did after watching the finale. You will have tons of great questions that you can't wait until the next episode to get answers about but instead of answers you get more questions. They are great questions, so compelling that I could not wait in between episodes and finished the entire first season in just two days, but what is the purpose of great questions if you will never get any answers? I easily would have given this 5-stars as long as she could have given us a couple answers or even just one. You can save yourself a lot of time and just read a wiki about the case and you'll get all the same info. Anyone like myself that listened to all of this deserves a follow up episode with real answers, hopefully the author has some resemblance of a conscience and will do something to help us get some truth. Unfortunately though it seems like she will just forget about all of us and just make new stories before ever finishing the old one. If you want to see something to prove my point just look at the list of reviews... Almost every five star is written by listeners still in the middle of the story and whenever you read the ones by people already done they give it one star. Just like Lost it is a great story but the lack of an ending means I would only recommend this if you are completely bored and have nothing else better to listen to. On a diff note...the author does speak extremely fast. This does not bother me at all but made my wife unable to enjoy the podcast at all."

It's like a watered down version of the TV shows ""Dateline"" and ""48 Hours."" After one episode I knew Adnan was guilty. It would be painful to admit that all the time and effort spent on his case was for nothing, so Sarah the narrator keeps going with it. Furthermore, it's evident that she develops some level of feelings for the murderer when she is hurt that he feels she doesn't really know him. The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. I hope there is available DNA evidence that will put any doubt to rest."	"This podcast is overrated, but will still be entertaining for those who can't get enough true crime media.

idoubtit	20151218T173054	2	Guilty (Of Intolerable Stupidity)?	I was a big fan of the Season 1 and was looking forward to the 2nd season. I was very disappointed in episode one. Bergdahl appears to be so stupid, I'm not sure I can listen to the season. I was in the military and understand fully the frustration of feeling you are being directed by incompetent leaders. There are ways to address incompetence. Bergdahl doesn't come across as smart enough to be a whistle blower. He comes across as uninteresting, naive, and stupid. Thus far, I don't care about him or what happens to him. I will give the 2nd episode a shot to see if it picks up at all. If so I'll hang in there; however, I am skeptical given what we learned in the first episode. I can't speak to his pending Courts Martial, but if episode 1 is any indicator, he is indeed guilty of gross stupidity.	I was a big fan of the Season 1 and was looking forward to the 2nd season.

MrOscarWao	20151218T053423	3	Glorifying A Deserter.	The narrator seems to have researched the facts, as much as possible considering the circumstances, however, she can barely hide her support and even admiration, for Bergdahl. Anyone who has served in uniform will tell you that, regardless of the difficult circumstances in which he was held, he is a criminal. Desertion is a crime under the UCMJ, period, a fact that isn't disputed. This kind of blatantly skewed reporting is what fuels the lack of trust in media these days.

She does not think that he should be punished for desertion or for putting his fellow soldiers in danger by sneaking away. It is gross to hear her refer to him as a 'hero'. and as she did in the first season Sarah is just crowbarring in what she believes and expecting the listener to follow her lead (true unbiased journalism at work, like how she insisted that Adnan was innocent even though he is clearly guilty). Unsubscribed and sickened by her Obama pandering, trying to make trading 5 terrorists for 1 liar seem justified.

Season 1 was excellent and season 2 is so far intriguing. Can't wait to see where it goes from here. I highly recommend.

The second season is an obvious PR job, or is it NPR job, attempting is provide cover for Obama's blunder.	The first season was superb, with a left leaning twist.

kbuckley8	20151211T223644	5	Great, But Problem With Season 1 Episode 3	The actual podcast itself is great, but there is an issue with Season 1, Episode 03 that cuts the podcast off at 4:47. I even contacted iTunes Support to help resolve the issue, but they said that only Serial can fix it by re-uploading it, and they told me to write a review that they'll hopefully see and fix the problem.

Reasonable Responses	20151211T190131	5	Addictive	The series is very addictive. From the beginning you're hooked, and don't want to turn the podcast off. It is like binge watching a Netflix series. Very, very hard to put down the headphones. I will admit, however, that the story can go off in a different direction from time to time, making it hard to follow along. But overall this is a very good, professional, well thought out, and interesting series. I am looking forward to the second season. The first episode just came out this Thursday. Be prepared: this podcast raises more questions than answers. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.	"The series is very addictive. From the beginning you're hooked, and don't want to turn the podcast off.

I really enjoy the way these stories are told. Unfortunately, after listening to the first episode, this story is (for lack of a better word) BS. ""I wanted to be like Jason Borne"" ""I wanted to give a gift of intel to the FOB when I arrived."" Those statements make me sure that he's spent his time in captivity coming up with this story. No soldier I know would say that crap. I will submit another review after I listen to all of it, but as of right now, I've said, ""BS"" in my head about 50 times in the first episode."

I have no interest at all and believe he should be put in front of a firing squad for his Desertion and Misbehavior in Front of the Enemy. He swore an oath to defend this country, and he walked off. Trading 5 Taliban for his worthless being is the worst thing Obama has done in office. God Bless America. :United_States:	"I'm sorry.

I listen to all of the major players, as well as some fringe podcasts, regularly. I'm not sure how or why it took me so long to find serial podcast. Let me be blunt, Serial is by far the best podcast available. From establishing standards in newsworthiness to the flawless spectacle of production Serial does not compromise in its journey for truth. I listened to the first episode of season 2 today, in the final moments the teaser for next week I had a jolt of energy run through my body. I am so in. That teaser and the emotions it brought up in me are easily going to be the best part of my day. Listen as soon as you can.	Alright look, I'm a journalism student and a podcast addicted human.

Lizz11	20151201T132438	4	Hook, Catch, Release	This podcast has my interest from its name alone. I instantly found myself talking out loud in response to listening to the content. It was a good listen and did exactly what I wanted it to do.. Put my mind somewhere other than in my work. Although I intently listened to every episode I found myself frustrated with how the facts and hearsay was presented. I almost feel bad for all of those involved that this was even brought up. It seems as though it should have been analyzed to first see if there could be anything unveiled and brought to light. Unfortunately I think it opened chapters that most people involved were happy to have had close regardless of it being positive or negative. From a listener's standpoint I was rather disappointed with the ending and I have to wonder if Sarah didn't know that she would be letting people down. I just wish it was different how it was conducted and people were portrayed. Jay is someone who thoroughly frustrates me! Why did they not pick his brain more. Other than Adnan, Jay was the most inconsistent with his stories and with how people viewed him. I just feel more content could have been pulled from him. Nonetheless, I was happy overall with this podcast and will intently listen to season 2 if and when it comes out in 2015!	This podcast has my interest from its name alone.

Does it matter? ;P	20151129T061805	5	Amazing	Fist of all I never used the podcast app but this changed all that. We need more podcasts like this and stories that reveal potentially free prisoners. Personally I believe Adnan is free and after listening to Undisclosed (the podcast that follows this as a spiritual successor) I truly can't see him in the wrong. As for serial, Sarah is a great host and the podcast itself is an amazingly written narrative. Not to mention that they go to such lengths to uncover the truth. I also love this as it inspires the podcast Hunt the Truth in some sense as Ben reminds me a lot of this. Still great podcast for any listener and new comer alike. Best part is that it's still a real life case and brings out the people's inner Sherlock. At least for me, 10/10	Fist of all I never used the podcast app but this changed all that.

Then it just kept rehashing and the host basically mentally masturbated and navel gazed and nothing was unearthed. It was like a weeks long episode of 48 hours that could have been condensed into an hour. Sure, some people liked it, and the usual sycophantic types started podcasts about this podcast like they were translating the Rosetta Stone. There are a lot of much MUCH better podcasts out there, including true crime focused ones. Give this podcast a decent burial and let's move on already.

mpc314159	20151123T193722	2	Very Mixed Feelings	"No question Serial is great entertainment. SK knows how to spin a yarn and that's exactly what she does here. Unfortunately this ""story"" is a murder case with appeals still going on (the latest going in Syed's favor) so it's really troubling to have it presented with so much spin to emphasize the drama at the expense of being manipulative and giving a skewed impression of the case. These are people's lives, reality TV tactics do play up the suspense and entertainment but that just isn't appropriate for a topic like this. Not to mention that since Serial aired, there have been MANY revelations of new information that cast the case in a new light. Hard to tell if Serial was sloppy and missed them, or intentionally left out things that didn't fit the storytelling. For someone interested in the case, this podcast is a begrudging necessity if only to get the story set up before moving on to better, more honest, and more thorough sources of info about the case."

Unfortunately this “story” is a murder case with appeals still going on (the latest going in Syed’s favor) so it’s really troubling to have it presented with so much spin to emphasize the drama at the expense of being manipulative and giving a skewed impression of the case.  These are people’s lives, reality TV tactics do play up the suspense and entertainment but that just isn’t appropriate for a topic like this.

Not to mention that since Serial aired, there have been MANY revelations of new information that cast the case in a new light.  Hard to tell if Serial was sloppy and missed them, or intentionally left out things that didn’t fit the storytelling.

For someone interested in the case, this podcast is a begrudging necessity if only to get the story set up before moving on to better, more honest, and more thorough sources of info about the case."
Kelsi621	20151121T063918	5	Engrossing Story... And Realistic Ending.	I loved the way SK details the story of Adnan, and also how she resists the urge to give a more flashy ending. She lays out some of the details while not boring the audience. If you're like me, after listening to Serial, go listen to Undisclosed. It may go too in depth on occasion, but is definitely worth it if you liked Serial.	I loved the way SK details the story of Adnan, and also how she resists the urge to give a more flashy ending.

LMurda	20151115T202418	4	Addictive, With A Big Asterisk	"Tore through this (my first podcast ever!) and loved the production quality, human interest aspect, and the way the narrative unfolded. It's a great binge listening experience. BUT. But but but. If Adnan's story perks your interest, and if Serial leaves you doubting his innocence, you truly need to know there were colossal important stones left unturned by Sarah and her team. And she came to certain conclusions based upon majorly inaccurate evidence. I'm not blaming her -- she never claims to be a detective or a lawyer -- but the Serial listener is lured to judge Adnan vicariously through through the host's ""gut instinct"" or emotionally-influenced deductive reasoning. You've been warned: there is so much more to Adnan's case than what is presented in Serial. I highly recommend Undisclosed. Albeit denser in content and choppier/amateur in production quality, it takes the facts and legal aspects of the case to a whole new level."

Zachaiasr	20151111T135649	5	Who Knew...	I had no idea that I would become so engrossed with an ongoing series about a man incarcerated for 1st degree murder for the last 15 years. As a previous Maryland resident for 25 years while growing up and as some one who moved away the year this crime happened, I've been sucked in. And I don't even like crime or court room drama. The way the information is presented is engaging and has propelled me to listen to the Disclosure podcast as well. I'm looking forward to the next season of Serial.

There are so many different facets, players, and nuances to the facts that it makes what happened less than clear. Sarah Koenig is not dissecting a legal case on the first season of Serial, she is weaving together a narrative using an extremely popular genre: True Crime. It's expertly executed even if it doesn't acknowledge the nuances of the case. (For that, listen to Undisclosed after you've listened to the first season of Serial.)

It kept me hooked, eager to hear more, and impressed with the lengths to which the writers pursued the topic. Most of all, it covered such a bizarre case that you can't help but wonder more about it. I will listen to Undisclosed next, a separate podcast that further delves into the details, including information after Serial wrapped up.

It kept me hooked, eager to hear more, and impressed with the lengths to which the writers pursued the topic. Most of all, it covered such a bizarre case that you can't help but wonder more about it.  I will listen to Undisclosed next, a separate podcast that further delves into the details, including information after Serial wrapped up.
JFulton	20151007T162442	2	Too Much Hype	Its a fact that an eyewitness is the most unreliable witness and that's predominantly what's on showcase here. There's one episode where they mention cell phone records...something undeniable, and it's glossed over. Yet, other arbitrary details are exhausted to no end. It's a frustrating experience. Partially due to the lack of evidence and part to the flaws in human character. This just drudges it out for 9 episodes.

cbxvvn	20151004T182750	4	Slightly Disappointing	Listening to the story was enjoyable, but the ending was lacking. At times I wanted to stop listening and read about it myself. The story is pure speculation by people who don't have the qualifications to speculate. This is another reason I debated whether or not to finish the series. Why should I listen to a reporter gossip about this when I can read the reports on my own? With that said the series was a fun listen, but not very gratifying.

I wasn't one of those as I feel if I put hours into anything, even its its just listening to a podcast, I'd like to have an end result. If you are like me, then watch The Jinx on HBO.

I guess that's unreasonable. But it was an exciting story none-the-less. My wife and I bounced back and forth from ""He didn't do it"" to ""OMG, it's so obvious that he did it!"". I personally think he did because in the courtroom he told Jay ""You're pathetic"". That comment wouldn't have come from an innocent man. Regardless... listen to this podcast. Very good!"

lunateamo	20150723T062634	4	Petered Out	I was hooked from the beginning, then I became less engrossed at the middle, and towards the end of the series I was downright annoyed. I loved Sarah Koenig's narration style and liked her genuine interest in finding out more information. However, right around the middle it became increasingly clear that no more information would be found. The episodes started to just re discuss the old often times not providing anything new. Yes, that was annoying but is at no fault of Serial or Sarah. She isn't a professional investigator. I give Serial four stars because of the culture that was created around the podcast. I loved getting to talk to my friends and hear their latest theories and talk to new people about what they thought too. I also give Serial four stars because it's a great podcast to introduce to podcast skeptics. Everyone loves a good mystery. Keep up the good work, looking forward to hearing the next in the series!

freebetch	20150722T032553	4	Tbh	Very addictive, but one-sided and definitely not enough content for 12 whole episodes. I thought Sarah's immediate trust of Adnan was annoying, especially because so little was said about the girl who was murdered. Sarah also disrespected the wishes of the victim's family by dragging out this inquiry without their consent, and without the Lee's input, she had no way of actually discovering anything. 3 episodes would have been fine.

After enduring numerous awful podcasts, I just found Serial and I'm thrilled. I love the format and the telling of one story over a series of episodes. I also love the inclusion of the interview footage of all the key players involved. I've listened to one too many true crime podcasts that turned out to be nothing but babbling monologues or dialogues between the hosts. Serial is intriguing and hearing from the people involved is what grips the listener from start to finish. I hope to see this continue. Excellent work!

I liked the details and the analysis. However, it was pretty clear to me from the beginning, that Adnan was guilty and that the key witness, Jay was probably involved to a greater extent than he admitted and that's why there are inconsistencies in Jay's story. Also, I felt great sympathy for Hae's family for having to relive this case again especially since SK seems so sympathetic to Adnan.

prodigcal_daughter	20150324T063834	1	Extremely Disappointed	I am a huge fan of true crime stories and although I am quite certain Adnan killed his girlfriend in a burst of teenage hormone fueled rage I thought this might provide the ability to change my mind or at least introduce reasonable doubt. It did not. Instead I found it to be really underwhelming. The narrator Sarah Koenig seems enamored with the murderer and gives him much more benefit of the doubt than a typical person would. At one point she tells him she knows him and it doesn't seem like something he would do and Adnan himself reminds her that she doesn't know him and this bothers her so much she spends maybe 5-10 min prattling on about how she DOES know him. She even goes on to bring it up at their next conversation because it bothered her so much. I found it laughable and embarrassing. There were moments where Adnans serial killer red flag alerts were blazing and she chose to ignore it. He was very glib and superficial and there were some points where for all of his glibness he still could not answer a question directly. HELLO SARAH K! That means he did it! She focused on poking the most minuscule of holes in the prosecutions case meanwhile completely ignoring the huge gaping ones in Adnan's. To me, this entire podcast was biased and seemed to be Sarah K. Stirring up a lot of old hurt for the possible acquittal of a murderer. It reminded me of the women who become groupies of notorious murderers. Sarah didn't uncover anything new or fascinating or earth shattering. This was sensationalism. Not journalism.

Johnny5321098632	20150313T002141	5	It Is Good But It Has To Prove It Can Do It Again.	I enjoyed Serial immensely when it was airing. I especially liked the episode format and Sara Koenig's casual interview style. The ethical questions that came up during and after the shows first season do complicate my appreciation. Do cliff hangers and narrative simplifications have a place in crime reporting? I am not sure. It was incredibly addictive and people were drawn into a great story. Unlike a serial drama there were no conclusions by the end of the season. Audience members ended up taking sides and became aggressive quickly removing any healthy discussion. I don't want to get into the issue of guilt or innocence. It was abhorrent the harassment committed bv strangers on the internet to people connected to the case. Serial needs figure out a way to distance itself from that subset of the audience. To maintain credibility Serial should change directions next season, away from criminal justice system. We will only know if this show is truly excellent once season 2 is released. My hope for season 2 is a topic more focused on investigative journalism that has a clear objective and conclusion.

"I have been hooked listening to this show, I do think however the narrator has an attachment and visceral need to convince herself and others this guy is innocent. I was hoping it would end in a confession so the family could at least get that. I can hear the lies in this guy but the host can't. Justice has been served, let the family have peace. The least thing he could be would be an accomplice, after all he spent the day with the guy who knew where the victim's car was. The host is just asking us to put that little tidbit aside?So why all the second guessing? It was either masterfully planned by Jay who had no deep attachment to the victim or like it is in 95% of cases due to the ex boyfriend being hurt and jealous. Why even look at serial killers.? Why would Jay help a strange serial killer hide a car and pin it on the ex? Jays story knew when phone calls were made and places they went before they even had the phone record to match his story. I would expect a few inaccuracies, but the overall story held, he saw a body in the trunk of a car and had details, liars don't have those kind of details. I think the host became infatuated with the murderer, this could be easily settled, just ask Adnon to do a polygraph, any wrongfully imprisoned person would be begging for a polygraph. My guess his response would be, ""I would love to but my lawyer forbids me...."" I feel bad a family had to suffer with this being brought up again for our entertainment, I was very interested."

KelleyGoosecock	20150309T101157	1	Disappointing	I'm a pretty big true crime fan so I went into this excited. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. It's just not very good. The narrater doesn't seem to have a background in this sort of field and it shows. She brings this sort of cheery NPR vibe to it and I don't think it's really appropriate in my opinion. Maybe it's just because I wanted a sort of late night noir vibe. The case itself is interesting enough I guess. Although it doesn't really stand out as anything too intriguing. It's not really told in a way that kept me hooked. Just seemed like minor bits of evidence scattered amongst several dull episodes of he said she said. I wish they would have gotten an actual investigator to narrate/research and kept the radio producers behind the scenes. Anyway if you're a big true crime fan I'd say skip this. There's plenty of other great true crime books, documentaries and shows out there to check out. If you're not experienced with the subject and just want a light mystery series to listen to while you exercise or do chores or something check it out.

jd2020	20150225T184454	2	Compelling Production, From Naive Investigators Or Shameless Hucksters?	Serial is a compelling production, with great music, but it seems that reality got away from the team. This is surprising in that it's backed by This American Life. The ending of the first season leaves more questions than they started with, and it seems like all the time listening was for naught. A sad story they dredged up is made doubly so by the Serial team's casual and somewhat reckless conjecture and speculation.

Damiteyeo	20150208T211715	3	Interesting But Biased Reporting.	This is such a fascinating and interesting series of events to learn about. I knew nothing about any of this before a few days ago. I'm on episode 2 and though I am very intrigued by all the information and interviews, I can't help but to get upset at how biased the narrator of this series is. It is obvious that the assumption by the narrator is that Adnan is innocent and was wrongfully convicted. I'm not a detective and I'm not saying he is innocent or guilty but to listen to this podcast and have it so obviously be reported so that is favors Adnan is a little aggravating. Even the interviews with people, who say one thing and are rightly confused or blurry with their memories, have their responses changed by the follow up questions that the narrator asks that are obviously leading towards desired responses that favor and look good for Adnan.

Instead it drags out details and goes over the same things over and over again, with no true ending. In the end it just comes off as a non-expert who believes she knows more than anyone else who had been involved with the case, enough to solve it for herself but falls short once she realizes...well, you can't.

Abe1741	20150131T192421	5	Phenomenal	I finally got a chance to listen to this podcast after hearing of all the positives of this show over the past five months, and I have to say this lives up to it all. This is not just no trumped up idle dig through, this is good all around from production to music, to interviewing, and to being honest, I loved every bit of it. And anyone in todays day and age, who can honstly say without bias or cyncicism that Anon is automatically guilty is really fooling themselves. If anything in my opinion I think Jay is an accomplice and that it looks bad for both of them and the ironys and coincidence especially when it comes to that call log and the best buy phone is a huge DEAL, but besides the point Great GREAT podcast!

Apart from the evidence, there was the weird tendency of the show's supposedly insightful host to insist that the victim's ex-boyfriend, whom she had rejected, had no motive. Seriously? A cynic might suggest that, though realizing she no longer had a true mystery, the host kept the show going by deliberately making things look more ambiguous and casting suspicions on others, without much support. And the inconclusive ending was incredibly disappointing. It must have taken a lot of mental gymnastics to write such an ambiguous and weirdly tortured final episode. What a let down. On the whole, I don't regret beginning to listen, but I do feel by the end that, for what it was, it was far too long. They worked hard to confuse and stretch out what was, in the end, a much more straightforward tale."	"It was hard not to find the first few episodes of this ""mystery"" deeply absorbing.

I felt like the show could have benefitted from being co-hosted by someone who was a forensics expert, or a crime investigator, or someone who worked in law (rather than having a few guests from these fields here and there). Maybe someone who would seem less driven by emotion and instinct? I also felt like it was all over the place and not very cohesive. I am left feeling like I read a long wandering book that had the last few pages torn out and replaced with the last few pages of another book. Kind of like I felt at the end of the show LOST.

Sean Sharp	20150125T231553	2	Season 1 Is A Bust	There's a lot not to like about Season 1 of Serial. For one, I get a general sense from every interview that pulling this 15 year old case from the grave was done in a less-than-tactful manner. There's something a bit pompous in the way that the producers approach the subject, as if they already have an axe to grind. The listener should also consider that these are real lives at stake here. The victim's family is pulled through what I am sure is an unending nightmare for them; the producers even have the gall to attempt approaching the family toward the end of the season. Compound this with the fact that the details of this case are just so ticky tacky and wishy washy that it's downright hard to care. Every single interview is a case of he-said she-said, and almost nothing here lines up. It could be that 15 years is a long time to ask of anyone to remember a few days' time, or the fact that half the people involved in this story seem to have been high as a kite while this whole tragedy was unfolding, or it could be the even more likely fact that no one really knows anything about this case and everyone is speculating on speculation. The producers feed into this speculation and even lead their interviewees down wild goose chases. Which begs the question: so what? What are we to garner from this 10+ hour ramshackle of a story? Are we to feel bad? For who? And about what? Toward the end, the series hints a bit toward the dysfunction of the legal system, which I think could have been a compelling ending, but the producers opted not to take sides on this matter. In all, I listened through to see where we would end up. But ultimately I wish I had gotten off at the first stop.	"There's a lot not to like about Season 1 of Serial.

Marie Alexandria Thorton	20150120T213102	4	Addicting And Insightful	Like everyone else I've found serial to be a truly incredible way to have explored the plight of Adnan Syed. I found myself going back and forth many times over as well, but where this show suceeds in so many ways it falls short despite itself. The last episode should have shared the letter Adnan wrote, and so many times during the show I felt like certain issues were just left unresolved even when the answers were answered indirectly in other episodes. I hope Koenig can bring a Season 2 that is half as good as this one, but I still kind of wish she would have just kept it going for longer than just 12 episodes if for anything else just in response to Jay finally speaking out. Overall Serial is a great podcast and I'm looking forward to the next season.	Like everyone else I've found serial to be a truly incredible way to have explored the plight of Adnan Syed.

feedyourhead101	20150124T204733	3	Entertaining Listen, However...	The story of Adnan and Hae plus the other people involved are fascinating mostly because I myself was a senior in high school in January 1999 and I used to work at a Best Buy for 5 years so it was intriguing on a personal level. It's mostly where my 3 stars come from. Even though I think Adnan is guilty (He is), from a defense point of view, his defense attorney M. Cristina Gutierrez was AWFUL. Only other defense attorney I've seen/listened to worse than her was Nedra Ruiz (San Francisco Dog Mauling Case). HOWEVER, I found the host Sarah Koeing to be extremely naive. Adnan is an intelligent guy. He's articulate and charming, but he's also manipulative and too inconsistent explaining the day Hae disappeared. Season 1 is still an intriguing listen but it's a rip off, from a certain point of view, for Sarah to conclude the season without a strong opinion of Adnan and Hae's death either way.. I'm not sure if I'll listen to Season 2.

I gotta admit it's a bit frustrating, so many questions to ask? Where's the DNA evidence, why didn't they question Don more? How about an interview with the parents? But overall so exciting and interesting. Is this guy sitting in jail when he shouldn't be? Is the real killer still out on the loose? Or is he where he belongs? Can't wait to find out...

However, one only needs to listen to the first episode to get a fairly detailed synopsis of the case; each subsequent episode takes a deep dive into every little lead, but much of it is simply Sarah speculating with little fact. Furthermore, beware that, unlike most stories, this one has no ending - and we may never find out what happens. An interesting take to a podcast, but I feel that it would be much better served as an act in This American Life.	Sarah is a good journalist who happens upon an interesting story.

It's a pleasure to experience, even though the actual content is terribly disturbing. A lesson to us all.

Grakkthal	20150117T233744	5	Brilliant	I could go on and on about all the things I love about this podcast but that would take days. It honestly all comes down to the fantastic Sarah Koenig. Not only is she extremely smart and articulate but she has a genuine curiosity that comes through on every episode. She is able to be objective and analyze this case honestly. I just love this podcast and I can't wait for season 2.	I could go on and on about all the things I love about this podcast but that would take days.

I heard about it on the Today Show right before the last episode, so I kinda got to cheat and listened to it in two days instead of all those weeks! I can't wait for her new one to come out ~ Thank you Sarah and crew especially the fact checkers I am sure that took a lot of time and money but it made it so much better for the audience. Especially if you have ever had any issues with the law/trials and know how prosecutors/detectives can and will manipulate the system to benefit their case.

Scrabble it up	20150114T182320	1	Great For All The Wrong Reasons...	I have to hand it to Sarah and the crew, their expert skills of presenting a first class podcast cannot be understated. The production team did an excellent job of captivating the audience and turned this nonstory into a must listen podcast. If you are interested in creating a good podcast, pay attention to the technical expertise of these professionals. As for the actual story... don't waste your time hoping for actual content or substance. I'm sure the production team spent a lot of time on this, but I have to say the actual story is pretty cut and dry. Basically, guy A kills his ex-girlfriend and guy B helps him cover it up and then tells on him. Cue curtains. But here's what interests me... you always get the feeling Sarah wants to take her questioning to the next level, maybe badger Adnan a little or straight call him out. I can tell she wants to sit this pathological liar down in the interrogation room, underneath the blistering heat of an incandescent lamp and make him sweat- maybe make him strap on some tight shoes and then go old school upside his smug little smile with a telephone book. I wish she would have too. Ultimately, she just wants him to tell the truth and cop to everything because deep down, her instincts won't let go of the fact that he's guilty. But you can also tell her brain tricks her into giving him the benefit of the doubt- maybe because he's a minority. Maybe beacuse a 'white savior complex' compels her toward an errant quest of chasing shadows. But no matter how hard you might will it, Sarah, you can't rescue the hollow carapace of this pathetic perjurer- he doesn't even once say he misses her or show the slightest grief over her death, weren't they friends?! Sad really, because there are so many other cases of similiar verve in which the antagonist is actually innocent. Besides, if this were simply a case of the cops pinning a crime on the minority, they would have convicted the black friend- that train is never late! Finally, Adnan's zen-like resolution to his lot in life is not the discovered state of peace romantically connoted in similiarly fashioned tales of an innocent convicted of a crime he didn't commit; it is the tacit conclusion of a confidence man who got what he deserved. Upshot: MailChimp got their money's worth from every advertising cent spent on this podcast. I just hope Sarah eventually pitbull's in on a real story, one sturdy enough to warrant the Pulitzer she's capable of.

JezuitX	20150104T060023	5	Haunting...	"I came upon this in the ""Best of Podcasts 2014"" and saw This American Life attached to it. Honestly I rolled my eyes, and thought it was going to be overrated. Needless to say the description hooked me, and I listened to the first one. Now after marathoning them all day I can't recommend this podcast enough. Koenig comes across as a neutral observer of facts, a person who's not affraid to ask the hard questions, and yet at the end you can clearly feel how this series has effected her. The narrative presented leaks into every corner of your imagination as each new interview or interesting piece of information is revealed. By the end of episode 12 you'll have an opinion over who killed Hae Min Lee and no matter what conclusion you come to you'll still ache to know ""the truth""."

J.Skeate	20150104T052503	5	Loved The First Season.	From amazing storytelling to in-depth analysis of a 1999 murder case, this season of Serial had it all. What can I say, I was hooked from the very first episode all the way through the last. I found myself with this amazing child-like ritual of waking up early on Thursday morning to listen before I had to go into work and battle with myself on the bike ride in (and for the rest of the week) on if Adnan was guilty or it was someone else. This is the new gold standard for podcasts and I look forward to season 2.	From amazing storytelling to in-depth analysis of a 1999 murder case, this season of Serial had it all.

Nabooly	20150102T051535	5	Excellent!	This podcast was so compelling....from beginning to end. I listened to all 12 episodes in less than a week. Yes, it was that good. Sara's reporting tied it all together beautifully and the story as it should be told; all nitty gritty details included. That's what kept me at the edge of my seat. You'd think, listening to such a complex story line with so many people involved, that it would become boring and uninteresting. But no, this is beyond sophisticatedly engaging. I cannot wait for season 2. Thanks to everyone involved in producing it!	This podcast was so compelling....from beginning to end. I listened to all 12 episodes in less than a week.

Sarah sounded like a naive fangirl with a crush from episode ONE.....whether or not this man is innocent or guilty is besides the point--she clearly had this little fantasy in her head of finding that one clue that would set an innocent man free and make her a national hero. Also, she seemed to have almost zero knowledge of crime scenes or murder trials, making her absolutely useless as a reporter. This came from NPR? What a joke.	this is objective, unbiased reporting?

I caught Serial late in its production, so I was able to listen without having to wait for new episodes. I tuned in on a whim, and then consume the entire podcast in a matter of days. Days only because life interfered with my desire to listen constantly. Otherwise, it might have been a matter of hours. I have come to expect a lot from NPR and anything affiliated with NPR, but this podcast was of a caliber that exceeded even my highest expectations. Although it feels odd commenting on the quality of Adnan's story given that it is true, I will say that selecting this case for further investigation was a worthwhile endeavor. Beyond the story though, Sarah Koenig's reporting, storytelling, and conversing were simply remarkable. I don't know that I have ever been so fascinated by any story, fiction or non, as I have been by this one.

Nesbolin	20141225T085306	5	Riveting	"I started Episode 1 yesterday morning (Christmas Eve) on my first two-hour drive of the day around 9 AM on a bit of a whim. I had been hearing about this ""serial"" but I really had no idea what it was, I just got the feeling that it was something big that I needed to know about. So instead of listening to the daunting pile of new music I had planned on gorging that morning, I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did. Three more long car rides and a regrettable time spent shoveling Biscoff cookie spread out of a jar (and into my face hole) later and I've consumed it all (partially literally). Now, at 2:20 AM the next morning (Merry Christmas), seventeen hours or so later, I have finished Episode 12. Because I got a late start, I obviously binged. I can't imagine now having to wait weeks for this story, I could hardly wait an hour between episodes. It's that good. While part of me needs this mystery to be wrapped up in a tidy package like a present under the tree, another part of me knows that life doesn't happen that way, and the same part of me really doesn't want there to be a pretty solution—after all, this is a very messy case. I must say that Koenig has a true gift for storytelling, and given such a thin case she has no problem bulking it up. I was fully enthralled the whole way through, even when the more monotone court proceedings came up I couldn't possibly be bored. The podcast format completely activated my imagination and I've resisted looking at photos posted to the website until the end. I truly care about these people, even the minor ""characters"", it's the strangest thing. It's an absolute joy (and at times discomforting) to feel, as a listener, that you are pinning down this case right along with Koenig and her colleagues. Your opinion becomes just as valid as anyone's as the story progresses, an element that captivates the listener in ways I haven't experienced before. At times I found myself in the car gripping the wheel so tightly that my hands turned red. Many times I burst into tears, but never for more than a minute. This is a raw story with a vibrant, shimmering cast of characters. It doesn't seem real at times, given the circumstances. Reality creeps back in when you realize that as this podcast was being released, new information was surfacing. What a great element. Adnan Syed is superbly fascinating. Sarah Koenig delivers his story in a truly human manner, and after more than a year of pouring her heart and soul into this case she has more than enough to show for herself. These are real people and it clearly shows. I can't say enough about this podcast. Listen and thank me later. And Koenig, if you're reading this for whatever reason, bravo.

I didn't know how addictive the life of an 'ordinary' person could be. This story could happen to anyone. I don't even know how it turns out yet but I listened to 9 episodes while cooking Christmas Eve dinner. Couldn't stop.

wxcore	20141224T054719	5	Completely Engrossing	I'm not a podcast guy whatsoever but this had me hooked from start to finish. I normally don't have the attention span to listen to people talk for an hour so I don't bother with podcasts, and they're usually pretty boring to me. I had heard a lot of buzz about Serial and eventually saw someone on the train with it open on their phone and thought that I should probably give it a try. I started listening to episode 1 last night and just finished tonight, one night later. I can only imagine how frantic I would be if I listened week by week - something I plan on doing whenever season 2 comes around. My only disappointment, now that it's over, is that no other podcast will compare to the experience of Serial. Kind of like watching Breaking Bad and trying to find another TV show to watch but nothing else is as good.	I'm not a podcast guy whatsoever but this had me hooked from start to finish.

I confess that I had no idea what it was, or that this was even a ""thing"" until the final segment had already aired. That's good, because I was able to listen to the entire story over just two days; if I'd had to wait a week between segments, that would have been unbearable. I'm a former Baltimorean, so I know the area well, which made this all the more intriguing. The Best Buy on Security Blvd? Yep, I know exactly where that is. Patapsco State Park? Been there too. Woodlawn High School? I've probably passed it hundreds of times in my life. But, I'd never heard of this story before, which may speak to the tenor of the times; a fairly run of the mill crime story for any urban area. Sarah Koenig takes a mundane whodunit and turns it into a thriller, but she never loses perspective, and never lets emotion cloud her task. This is journalism at its best. Well done, Sarah, Ira Glass and everyone else involved in this project. Let's hope the professionalism that you've shown in reporting this story is emulated by others in the media. We need that. I have seen a few stories that are mildly critical of how Hae's story has become ""entertainment."" Be aware that this isn't the case here. This is a sober, clear-eyed piece of journalism that's well worth your time. If it were in book form, no one would have batted an eye. And lastly, the score is superb. Not intrusive, and a perfect fit with the mood of the story. I cannot wait for the next installment."	"I can’t get over how unique and engrossing this podcast is.

My gripe is with the content. As a prosecutor, it is clear to me that this case comes down to Jay or Adnan. You do a great job of exploring the intricate details, but you get lost in them. The real question is who killed Hey (sp.)? Jay is the only real evidence that Adnan killed Hey. But you really do not attack him and neither does Adnan. Adnan's failure to challenge Jay, his story, or his motivations signals his guilt to me. Jay is obviously involved in this killing. By his own words we know this. But you fail to point the finger at him. As does Adnan. He is the only viable suspect, other than Adnan. I really wish you would have focused more on Jay. He is the entire prosecution case. The ending was unsatisfying.	"Let me say first that this is one of the best podcasts that I've ever experienced.  The sound editing, production, etc. is perfect. My gripe is with the content.

Here we go: Finally tried to give this a listen. Keyword: tried, like I really tried, but it was so difficult to listen to. I just couldn't stand the format, pace and narration. It's so darn slow! If there was an addition to the collection of antonyms to the word: 'succinct', 'Serial' would belong there. I think the narrator's organization is akin to walking in a sparsely filled parking lot blindfolded in hopes that several episodes later you'll finally find where you parked when you realize you only live a block away you should have just walked home straight in the first place. They could have improved the suspense by making this into 1 or 2 episodes series simply by removing all of the speculation and gossip by the narrator. On the other hand, the quality of recording and actual audio inserts were nice :D but not nice enough to make up for each episode's fragmented cadence. Sorry guys gals, I really tried to like it, but the way its narrated just drags. Listening to each episode is like waiting for a webpage to load on a dial-up line running AOL 2.0 and then you're bombarded by pop-ups full of speculation further adding to the cumbersome experience. Lastly, this is a really sad story. A poor girl was murdered and this dude who probably did it is being remembered for it when his name should have be forgotten like all the other American Idols after Kelly Clarkson. The storytelling was more subjective than informative and the fact that some people find this entertaining, makes this that much more tragic. Again sorry to the fans! But I'm with the others on this one. Hopefully the next series will be better. I'll give it another shot then!	"Yep, so going to play the devil's advocate here. Sorry to the fans!

NickJamster	20141219T093603	2	Stop At Episode 4	There's just nothing ever new to say. It's not a mystery - the only plot 'twists' are omitted facts which are later revealed, so information is selectively portrayed. Also she continually leads the people she's interviewing - never asking them what happened, but rather reading a statement of events and then asking them to corroborate. Don't waste 8 hours on this.

Disappointed TAL Listener	20141218T235429	1	Botched, High-End Tabloid Journalism	"Botched, high-end tabloid journalism. Serial undertakes to discover the Truth about a murder case (way to big a task in this case), and doesn't, and then tries way to hard to cover its tracks and somehow claim that it's OK to have gone through this exercise without acknowledging all of the collateral damage it has inflicted. Botched: because it doesn't accomplish any worthy purpose except capturing our interest. High-end: because it is approached under the pretense of a balanced story-telling experience. Tabloid: because it drags a lot of people through the mud (especially the crime victim's family, and another last-minute suspect who is conveniently dead and can't defend himself) without establishing any conclusion. Serial pays frequent lip service to, but ultimately has no respect for, the question: How do we really know any of this? I am not connected to this case in any way, and I love This American Life and the kind of work they do. I listened to every minute of Serial from start to finish. To those ""enjoy the journey"" types who maybe don't care as much about the means used to produce their chosen content, or the end to which it is leading, I say: in the last several episodes Serial plods along in such an unsatisfying, gossipy, dithering way as to insult everyone involved. There is a lot of talent involved in its production, to be sure, but I will definitely read the reviews and ignore the spoiler alerts IF there's another season. Wow what a waste of talent and my time."	"Botched, high-end tabloid journalism.

CMWheat	20141218T143352	5	A Real Story Of This American Life	I just finished listening to the final episode, and I must say that the time I have spent listening to this podcast has been some of the most captivated of my life. This podcast is not only expertly done but is a story of real life. There is no part of life where it is easy to find complete certainty, and we most often struggle with doubt. This is a story that captures this tension perfectly as dozens of individuals influenced the development of a narrative that would, for better or worse, make one man's life different forever. I look forward to the second season because I cannot wait to hear more stories that capture the struggle of life like this one does.

Sarah Koenig tells a beautiful, layered story that you can't stop listening to. I recommend it to anyone, even those (like me) who are sick of crime shows.

What makes this different and all the more riveting is how it demands your undivided attention. It's not like other things where you can space out for a bit and come back.

Steve_Downshift	20141212T162958	5	Compelling Journalism	There's a good reason this podcast has rocketed to fame in the short 12 weeks since it's launch - it's thoughtfully crafted, and has compelling subject matter. By the end of each episode, I'm frothing for another. It's like the suspense at the end of a great TV episode (I'm looking at you, Heroes season 1 and 2...) but without the visual aspect, somehow reaches a different area of your imagination. Top-notch stuff; can't wait to see how it's wrapped-up next week!

davecave07	20141211T184634	3	Going Down Hill	This series started out fantastic. At first it sounded like Sara Koenig was trying to keep it fair, balanced and factual, however, the last few episodes have started to sound like she has gone the way of Nancy Grace; just feelings, rumors and presumptions. Maybe there is a valid reason for this? I hope so. I fear the whole thing at the end will just make for good dramatic listening instead of exploring the very real guilt or innocence of a person which still seems to be at risk in real time. I do appreciate the questions it raises about our legal system and all of the related social interactions and consequences, yet I'm also left unsatisfied on that front since the formatting of this show is not geared towards having a balanced conversation about any one of them. I'll admittedly keep listening though...	This series started out fantastic.

It's like we're getting to listen to the kind of research one might do while making a documentary, but with a documentary hundreds of hours end up on the cutting room floor. We're getting an overview of what might land on the cutting room floor, as the research is going on. We get the excitement of discovery that happens during research.

JW French	20141209T173516	5	Reality Noir	This is an absolutely fascinating story, both for the facts of the case, as well as how it is presented. Journalist and narrator Sarah Koenig. It is truly a journey, as Koenig takes you through the confounding but riveting story, and you feel like you are uncovering all the pieces of questionable or confusing evidence, or lack thereof, right along with her. Add in a compelling set of characters to untangle and you have what might seem like an accidental hit. It's a drama from over 15 years ago that is still playing out.

ninjasuper	20141209T070031	3	Shows Great Promise From A Great Premise	Serial has a solid premise for a compelling podcast. Right now, the storytelling relies too much on speculation and withholding of pertinent information. This approach scatters the narrative, and makes listening to the story irritating. What kind of podcast am I listening to? Is this a true crime tale filled with facts? Is this a work in progress, stumbling upon a truth? Where is the movement toward a larger understanding of what is going on? Every episode confounds the previous ones. The approach to telling a longer story needs to have a better idea of what it intends. Right now, Serial doesn't have that quality. It is slickly produced, variably compelling, and ultimately flailing. But I am not altogether against this podcast. This first season is a test, and those involved in its production will necessarily learn and evolve. It's ok, sometimes good, and sometimes falls flat. I look forward to changes in the next season to make the podcast stronger.	Serial has a solid premise for a compelling podcast.

I tried Serial again today because of the hype it's been receiving and it's still terrible. The last two I listened to were all about Sarah's feelings and her process of discovery. BORING! I just quit in the middle of the one where she is interviewing an attorney and says ""I feel"" like 30 times in 4 minutes.

Dichterliebe1	20141206T022553	2	Form Over Substance	There's lots of details about the lives of ordinary teenagers just like on Ira's show. Which can be interesting in small doses if there is insightful commentary or it is colorful in itself. Here it is all splayed out with little momentum behind it. The podcast combines the earnest storytelling charm of TAL with the morbid puzzle-solving of all our grandmas' favorites like Matlock and Murder She Wrote. What makes it seem unique is that's it's a new form for podcasts and it's not about elderly people. Once you get over that, the mystery and intrigue quickly dissipate. As a side note, Serial underlines the iPod's perplexing inability to order podcast episodes from oldest to newest. Listening to them in serial fashion, one must return to the menu between each episode to scroll up.	"There’s lots of details about the lives of ordinary teenagers just like on Ira’s show.

Fit2BeTied	20141203T231454	5	The 20/20 Of Podcasts	"This series is honestly so captivating. It actually feels wrong to write that it's ""entertaining"" given that real lives are being chronicled...perhaps ""fascinating"" is a better description. In any event, the narrator is a skillful orator who keeps your interest and the storyline is a real life ""whodunit."" The narrator tells the story of a real murder from various points of view, including that of the young man who was convicted of committing a horrible crime. In addition to revealing the various points of view, this podcast provides a glimpse of all the moving parts of our justice system from the initial investigation to the manner in which a defendant's lawyer handles a case (and the evidence he/she decides is important or relevant at any given time). At this point, I don't know who's story to believe so I anxiously await each week's episode to hear another piece of the story revealed so I can reach my own conclusion about the young man currently serving a prison sentence for murdering his ex-girlfriend. I'm hoping that this will be the first in a long series of true life crime drama podcasts."	"This series is honestly so captivating.

ES Burns	20141201T183454	5	Superb	Incredibly well done in a very approachable way. Sarah makes it clear, she's not a detective, but asks reasonable questions about a murder case ruling that seems suspicious. What's riveting to me is of course what the resolution (if any) will be regarding this reporting and how this podcast reminds us all how easily our opinions can be swayed. I have flip-flopped whether he is guilty or not throughout the episodes and find my own personal reactions to the facts a very interesting reflection of myself and my own judgements. I appreciate that this isn't a cut-and-dry case of clear evidence pointing to his innocence. I just don't know... and for that, I can't wait for the next episode.

heyhowyadoinfriend	20141129T190528	4	Amazing With A Side Of Uncomfortable	Not that serial NEEDS another review, but I'll toss in my 2 cents anyway. Sarah Koenig has created an amazingly engrossing story, weaving a movie quality narrative from real events. This is both a huge part of the success of the show and one of its greatest liabilities. Since the narrative is so tightly controlled, it can sometimes seem like important things are being neglected (like the fact that we knew next to nothing about Hae until the 8th episode, and we still don't know much), and koenig's humorous asides can seem oddly out of place in a story that, at its heart, is about the murder of a young woman. Still, an amazing effort, one that has revolutionized the world of podcasting.	Not that serial NEEDS another review, but I'll toss in my 2 cents anyway.

Answers to most of the show's questions will not be found and it will likely end with an underwhelming whimper rather than a bang. It's a lot like reading Stephen King's ""Colorado Kid"" (spoiler alert!) in that an intriguing narrative ends up being all for naught when there is no real solution given to the mystery. The host is threatening to do a second season and is asking for listener support (how NPR) to fund it despite having sponsors. It's hard to believe such a phenomenon of a show with millions of listeners can't find more sponsors and has to resort to asking the listeners for money. The show is getting weaker with each episode and probably doesn't deserve public funding or a second season."

cloverzx	20141123T165508	5	Hooked	On a 3 hours long bus drive, this kept me calmed down. Totally hooked considering I am a law student taking trial advocacy at the same time. I know exactly why the prosecutor was building that theme into his closing argument, why even though the case was pretty thin, they still went through. Though I can tell occasionally the producing is letting her emotion run, she is characterizing this person and that person, but that's ok, and that's the techniques and the necessity of a good podcast. Love it, 5 stars!	On a 3 hours long bus drive, this kept me calmed down. Totally hooked considering I am a law student taking trial advocacy at the same time.

The amount of work and research put into this podcast are amazing, but the best part for me is Sarah Koenig's skill for interviewing. She doesn't censor herself when talking to Adnan or anyone else. She asks straightforward and difficult questions. Definitely will be donating money in hopes of getting a second season!

Nickname awesomer than yours	20141120T172216	4	Serial-Honest Review	Serial is a podcast following the murder story of Hay Min Lee. I won't give you a synopsis, there's already one of those. I do feel the Podcast's can be a little disconnected. At first you think it can't be Jay. Then you're led into thinking it couldn't be anyone BUT Jay. It get's confusing. But since it's a murder mystery I'm willing to let that pass. I do think there should be longer but fewer episodes. Kind of like BBC version of Serial. 3-8 episodes and you're done until the next season. I understand she dedicates certain subjects to certain podcasts, however having episode after episode will draw it out too much. I still listen to every episode that comes out, I'll admit I'm fascinated to see who did it. Overall, I'd like a second season. Just with a couple of changes. I'd also like the episodes to be consistent in time, or at least more so. Even if she has to talk away for another five minutes on inconsistencies, I feel like if I'm going to contribute finically to a second season, I want a good stable podcast. In the end, I'll keep listening because I honestly enjoy it. I think it's a fantastic podcast, and Sarah does a great job with it.	Serial is a podcast following the murder story of Hay Min Lee.

However, at eight weeks in, it's really starting to lose steam. Why are we still rehashing the mundane details of this case, for hours at a time, unless there's going to be a big payoff at the end? I'm really crossing my fingers that there will be some kind of breakthrough or satisfying conclusion to justify having listened to meandering, circular conversations about old (albeit well-researched) information for so many weeks...

I wish I could say I'm enjoying it without reservation, but I often have to remind myself that this story, while both fascinating and entertaining, exists only because a young girl was actually murdered.

She lays all her cards on the table, her struggle of going back and forth on whether she believes Adnan Syed is guilty or innocent. But she lets the listener make up their own mind. The amount of research and attention to detail that Koenig gives to the story is astounding. She has left no stone unturned and the listener is right there with her.

This might reflect the non-linear quality of a real investigation. Each episode explores a facet of the story, answers some questions, creates confusion and comes to no conclusion. In my opinion, the host's emotions are too readily displayed for a show about a criminal investigation. In ep7, she speaks with a lawyer from the Innocence Project who ""has no time for BS"" and cuts right to the chase. Sarah proceeds to ask her the same question repeatedly about how Sarah should be feeling about the case and they talk about the emotions that investigators feel as a case unravels. It was interesting, but drawn out and amusing considering the lawyer was presented as this get-down-to-business no-BS type. In an earlier review I said the show hadn't found its own voice and was indistinguishable from TAL. I think it has found a style now. It's similar to TAL though a bit slower. It's deeper in the weeds (good and bad) and doesn't use comedic contrast to offset the emotional segments."

Kennardy	20141116T180449	4	Extremely Interesting	There are a lot of ways to tell a story and this is great story telling. Some complain that there are inconsistencies and gaps...uh, yes...just like the real investigation and trial. I feel like I have the same confusion and emotional swings that the police, attorneys and jurors must have felt. Just when you form an opinion, a small piece of info changes that opinion! I just hope this story ends well. Great job and I hope 5 million downloads turns to 10 million before the last episode is posted.

bdill12	20141116T215950	5	Longform Podcasting Fully Realized	While Adnad and Jay are certainly magnetic and enigmatic, it's Sarah and her genuine interest as she moves back and forth between interested and obsessive that takes this story to a higher level. She is compelling. She becomes as much a part of the narrative as any of the actual participants, and she doesn't steal focus or get lost. It's quite an achievement.

notamusicsnob	20141114T075737	5	Brilliant. Period.	"This show is beautifully paced. The style is compelling. The music is intense. The way they break their re-investigation of this crime into a different theme every week (alibi, the route, now Jay) leaves me on the edge of my seat. And like the host, I keep going back and forth on whether I think he did it. (What do you wanna bet that the show doesn't answer the question...) I see two kinds of critiques. (1) ""He's obviously a murderer so investigating the crime again makes me mad,"" and (2) ""it's so long and boring."" There's not much I can say about (2) except that I don't understand how your mind works if you find this boring. I'm on the edge of my seat. As for (1), I think it really says a lot about you when a host who talks A LOT about how she goes back and forth on Adnan's guilt = a shill for the defense. That THE REASON you don't like the show is that you're asked to keep an open mind while they look back over the evidence. So many criminal cases are like this - there's some good evidence, some mistakes by the police, some bad evidence, some suspicious stuff the defendant did - and then we ask a jury to sort it all out. I wish police departments had some kind if review boards that would take this kind of thorough, unbiased second look at all cases. Or just hire Sarah Koenig's team to do it."

You hear the 'truth' that someone wants to tell. And that might not be true at all. I hope this series continues with more cases.	This show is wonderful.

MI BeerLover	20141113T175055	5	Podcast I Can Get Used To	This is the most interesting podcast I have come across and props to all involved with telling this story and making it so intelligent. I have one question or maybe a request... I'd like to hear about Adnan's reaction to Hai's (guessing on the spelling) death. I'm guessing it was sadness but I don't remember actually hearing about his reaction so far in the story. We've now heard about Jays remorse, so now I want to hear about Adnan's. As a listener, the more I've heard the more I've become on-the-fence about Adnan's innocence which upsets me because I genuinely wish for a happy ending for him so it would help to hear about his reaction to the news. I feel like there's an unmistakeable honesty that comes out when you hear such a thing about a person you once cared so deeply for. I don't ask to have him relive that moment because nobody wants to do that but maybe if there was some record of it, it would be interesting to hear.

Hopefully this type of podcast will result in more reporters profiling potentially innocent inmates. Since we can't always rely on the police, judges and juries to be fair and honest, maybe it's up to us!	I waited with immense anticipation for this podcast to begin.

jane_seager	20141109T230920	4	Mixed Feelings But I Can'T Call It Boring	"There are things I like and don't like about this show. I like what it has to say about TAL-style quasi-journalistic storytelling...how it's weirdly analogous to forensic work, except it's aware (or should be aware) of its own emotional investment, its impulse to narrativize and frame the evidence. But the show also feels exploitative to me. I keep cringing at the way these kids' lives are being converted into a lurid, suspense-filled tale - ""find out next week!"" (The very name of the show implies this.) Again, maybe that's in the nature of this type of storytelling and this show it just pointing it out more bluntly than usual? Any pleasure is a pretty complicated, ambivalent pleasure, to say the least. But boring it ain't. And I like that Koenig genuinely doesn't know how it will end - she's a few steps ahead of us but only a few, which means she can only control our perspective so much. That's pretty neat."

3bucks	20141111T011707	1	Ethically Challenged	The idea of long-format, episodic story telling is fantastic. That being said, I am truly disgusted by the choice of content. It is amazing to me that intellectual individuals , such as the producer if this podcast, still don't understand that crimes are almost never logical. So, just because it doesn't seem consistent with who this young man seemed to be, doesn't mean he didn't do it. Clearly, clearly, clearly this murderer was the only one with both motive and opportunity. He did it, period. What i question is your judgement. Giving this murderer 12 hours of fame is sickening; and the incredible amount of pain you are inflicting on the family of this murder victim is astounding. By leaving this review and closing my checkbook to NPR, I would like to leave a clear message, you have exited the expected sphere of morality and damaged the trust that your listenership demands.

Sarah and her team do a great job of putting us in her shoes: a layman using commonsense, thought and investigation to both learn about how the judicial system works - or maybe doesn't - and try to figure out what the hell happened. I especially like how it feels like real time. Each week, we feel like she's NOT just reflecting back on something that's done and determined, but rather like we're with her during that point of her investigative journey.

The host does a great job of exploring all the details of the case, from the law issues, to the social psychology issues. While the law issues are the most important parts, those issues are naturally going to be answered last, if they can be, but because the host does a great job of exploring the intriguing social aspects of what kind of character the suspect is, the audience forgives being strung along for the ride. Again, fantastic show, keep up the good work.	The first season so far is fantastic.

nic_msp	20141108T032544	5	Good Stuff	Although I like the novelty that This American Life has by keeping each theme different every week, this podcast does a good job of asking some serious questions about this specific case. I'm hooked on this one already and I can't wait to see what the other seasons have to offer. The reporters do a good job of giving nuanced clues in general. However, they make it seem like the main character is innocent, some of the issued raised overall are pretty interesting. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes 60 Minutes, This American Life, or Dateline type shows.

True crime cases are a fascination of mine and this show puts you right in the middle of an investigation and takes you through it step by step it's so interesting.

JRA1989	20141103T021323	5	Very Well Done, But Tired Of This Story By Now	I'm a huge fan of This American Life, and I've been really enjoying the first few episodes of this story. But by episode 6, I'm experiencing some fatigue with this story. With every episode throwing tons of contested details and he-said-she-said quotes, I'm just sort of eager for this story to be over with. It seems like nothing in the plot has advanced that much after 6 episodes. I hope the next story is a little more interesting and concise. Otherwise, the podcast is great.

I don't know if Adnan did it, the brilliance of the podcast is that (so far) it hasn't resolved this case. To not trivialize the realness of this case, a real person was killed, a real person is in jail for life, but this reminds me of Twin Peaks in a way; have we really found who killed Hae Min Lee?

drea perk vador	20141031T044658	2	"I'D Rather Be Watching ""Rectify"""	At this point, the only thing this show has going for it is a really good theme song. I was on board in the beginning, now I'm just annoyed. If you don't want me to think Adnan is the killer, please give me at least one other viable suspect with possible motives. You'd think that after five episodes, this might have been mentioned, at least in passing. Maybe this is partly why every time I hear Adnan speak, my gut tells me he's guilty. Unlike the host, I don't find him very likable or interesting. He has the cadence of a liar. More importantly though, the handling of the story isn't nuanced or compelling. The repetitive examination of the same minutiae, episode after episode, is not deepening the tension / mystery, it's flattening it. I do like the premise of the show, and hope they might take some cues from other serialized forms of entertainment, but so far you have not left this listener wanting more.

planctil	20141031T041453	3	Serialized Like A Dickens Novel	I agree with the more negative reviews on here but don't think it's terrible. The host is really just mindlessly speculating and gossiping without really going anywhere. Each episode ends on a note of mystery though - a hook. So then this is pretty much the modern equivalent of a Charles Dickens novel, sadly, but even less narrative drive.	I agree with the more negative reviews on here but don't think it's terrible.

Thank you for producing this and sharing it. I'm thoroughly engrossed in the story and its many paths. And I find myself listening to it multiple times instead of other podcasts or even music on occasion.
bytor	20141027T231424	3	Where Is This Going?	I must say I really enjoy listening to this but I'm not sure why. I like Sarah's voice and the story is fairly interesting but I can't help but feel that the person who commited this crime is right where he belongs. He claims he loved this girl but I feel no sense of sympathy or loss in the tone of his voice. I am not sure where Sarah is leading us but I guess I'm along for the ride.

Ryguy331986	20141026T163224	1	Loose	I have a number of issues with this: 1) through 4 episodes, outside of some minor inconsistencies and timeline stuff, there's nothing that says this guy didn't commit this murder. 2) If he is innocent, then Jay has to be guilty or culpable, for why would he make up such a story? Yet we've barely talked about his possible involvement as more than an accomplice. By ep 1, this is THE QUESTION. Is jay lying and why? Yet it's ep 4 and the question remains unaddressed. Bad or lazy storytelling. 3) As a narrator, it seems that she forgets that a young girl with a life to live was brutally murdered and buried in a shallow grave. The tone should reflect that. Maybe there is not enough material to make 10 episodes, hence we're avoiding the main question and meandering, but I'm not listening further.	"I have a number of issues with this:

Start at the beginning of this series in order to capture the entire depth of the story. I hope more podcasts in this style show up. It is thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking.

chris winn	20141025T135718	1	Painful	I'm a big fan of TAL so I was excited for this. It's terrible. Listening to Sarah Koenig narrate tapes of her gossiping and speculating about a murder offers no more insight than I could generate on my own. There's nothing interesting about speculation. I'm not listening to a detective or an FBI agent. I'm listening to a radio producer say, Who did it? Who knows? It's excruciating and getting more credit than it deserves purely because of the names involved.	"I'm a big fan of TAL so I was excited for this. It's terrible.

cookie_jess21	20141023T174754	5	Very Engaging	I happened upon this podcast, and am very intrigued by this 'case'. I was graduating high school in 99, so the timing/timeline is weirdly familiar to me having been in their 'shoes' at that time. Listening to several episodes, I can tell you I would have hardly any memory of anything that happened 15 years ago while in school, but my friend was not murdered/ accused of murder, so it's hard to say... I find myself really thinking hard about the details, timeline and everyone's stories and am not sure I believe or disbelieve anyone at this point which is interesting because I believe Sarah is in the same boat. I think that is what makes it so powerful. I also think her story telling style and even her voice works well in a podcast format.	I happened upon this podcast, and am very intrigued by this 'case'.

(I'm not surprised given Koenig's previous work, of course, but it's worth noting.) The details can be fast and furious, but it's not difficult to keep up. I've actually listened through twice, which is nice for reviewing how ""earlier"" things sound now that you know more information.

The first being: The Episodes are too short!- I don't know about you, but at thins point, I'm just used to a longer format, and it's deeply frustrating to me that each episode seems to end so quickly after it's begun. Secondly: This whole week to week thing is KILLING ME. They really should have gone with the Netflix season model and released the whole thing, at once, in chapters. As it is I'm thinking I'll stop listening to it until the whole season is out, and I can listen to the whole thing. besides that... it's great... I HIGHLY reccomend it... just as soon as all the episodes are out.	"First, let me say, that I love serial, and I think it is riveting and beautifully told. That being said I have 2 issues with it.

This is the moment you pull into your driveway, but the story on NPR is so gripping, it's impossible to turn the key in the ignition switch to off. You just have to hear the end of the story. I say all that to say this... Serial in its entirety is a driveway moment. Could their be a higher honor amongst public radio aficionados? I think not. Around the office we've dubbed it the ""True Detective"" of podcast. It's a slow burn podcast that isn't wrapped up with a bow at the end of each episode. There's a reason to keep tuning in. Serial is a must listen in a age saturated by podcasts. Great work to everyone on the team, I hope this message reaches you."

Lizie_bee	20141011T234308	4	Great So Far	This is a very well done podcast that I am very excited to keep up with. I think it has potential to last a long while. The only reason I gave a four star instead of five is that I am concerned with the notion that the producers don't know where the story will end. One complaint I have about TAL is that some of hte stories feel cut short, or lacking in closure. I am afraid that this series could do that to us a lot. If they don't know where this story ends, how can we trust that the ending will be satisfactory? This is just a small concern though, I am excited to follow the journey to the end.

Laryssa C.	20141009T234021	5	Tal Spin-Off Series...Does Not Disappoint	This American Life decided to take some of their longer stories and transform it into a serial radio show.

So far, it's been fabulous.

Ryaaaan	20141008T065911	5	A Gut Punch To The Soul	I cannot help but writing this review. Serial is a podcast format unlike anything I've ever heard. Though the This American Life producers are masters at condensing compelling stories into short formats, they've unbound themselves from the shackles of the traditional hour-long radio format to create a spinoff show, Serial, which dedicates an entire season dedicated to investigating and telling a single story. Sarah Koenig makes a masterful debut. In uncovering the tragic story of the murdered Hae Min Lee, Koenig leaves no stone unturned. She digs deep into the personal lives of Hae Min and her ex-boyfriend and accused murderer, Adnand. Her story includes reading excerpts from Hae Min's diary, digging up her intimate and sometimes silly memories of teenage angst that everyone has experienced, albeit not as publicly as this. Koenig weaves an incredible story of the role that love, heartbreak, sex, murder, lies, drugs, religion, and family plays in these teenagers lives. She does this without leaving listeners feeling like she's exploiting the story of the deceased Hae Min. I don't know how she does it. It's sublime. I cannot wait for the next one. Listeners beware, this isn't a fun podcast. It's incredibly dark, visceral, and will fully engulf you. There's a moment when a certain RandB song plays in the podcast that punched me in the gut. I was a teenager in 1999 and that song meant to Hae Min the same thing it meant to every teenager, and it brought the feelings home closer than I was prepared for. Thank you folks at This American Life for venturing into another format. Wait 5 years for my income to go up a bit and I'll throw all my money your way.	"I cannot help but writing this review.

eka707	20141008T010328	5	Already Hooked!	After listening to Serial, I am already obsessed! I even tried googling facts about the case to see if the main character was released from prison yet (he hasn't been, ugh). Although I was skeptical at first, I subscribed to the podcast and listened to it because I've been a huge fan of This American Life for several years (it was my gateway drug to Radiolab, The Moth, Risk, etc.). My initial (disappointed) impression before listening was that it was a fictional podcast, and I was thrilled to find that it was a real story! I don't know why I thought it would be fictional, but I love the way Sarah narrates the story. She is a wonderful orator: even when she's speaking, it's like reading a (very well-written) book. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this podcast! My only gripe is that the episodes are never long enough, and I don't know how I'll possibly go an entire week between episodes. It's hard enough waiting for The Moth every week, and those stories aren't even continuous! Looking forward to the next few months!	"After listening to Serial, I am already obsessed!

I've always enjoyed Sarah K's contributions on TAL, and Serial proves she's more than capable to have her own show. She weaves, or unravels, depending how you look at it, an intriguing story from the first few sentences of the premiere ep that had me hooked. I had to drop everything I was doing and listen to the two eps that were released back to back, and I can hardly wait for the next one.

Missy2278	20141004T030238	5	Amazing New Podcast!	I'm not only a podcast junkie but an audible book junkie. I listen to tons of podcasts and this one had me hooked from the preview. It combines the shorter, frequent stories you get on podcasts with the in depth detail and development of a true crime book. Genius! I really care about this story and the people involved. Can't wait for the next download!	I'm not only a podcast junkie but an audible book junkie. I listen to tons of podcasts and this one had me hooked from the preview.

AshleyActually	20141004T004910	5	Hooked	I have to say this is one of the most engrossing stories I've ever had the pleasure of being at the edge of my seat for. I need to know what comes next! I'm so excited to fall in love with a new podcast, especially one that's doing something so unique. The stories matter enough to give them real time and attention. I'm drawn to that. Thank you, Sarah for your insatiable journalism!	"I have to say this is one of the most engrossing stories I've ever had the pleasure of being at the edge of my seat for.

HuJo742	20141003T231558	5	Amazing!	"Love the idea of a serialized show, especially one with such amazing production and investigative work. Really excited for the rest of this season, and for what future seasons may hold. Reminds me of the documentary miniseries, ""The Staircase."""

Lc485678	20141003T194210	5	Already Dying To Hear Episode 3	As a major fan of This American Life, and Sarah's stories in particular, I could not wait to listen to Serial. I found myself mesmerized by Adnan and Hae 15 minutes in to Episode 01. The way Sarah and the team is presenting this podcast is devilishly addicting. Also - I love that the letters are posted on the Serial website. You've teased me in to obsession and now I want to know the truth in this mildly fanatical way... I am dying for Episode 03!

GRubi25	20141003T180945	2	1St Episode Doesn'T Download	I was excited to see that, finally, the first episode was available today. Not only that, but so was the second episode! Unfortunately, there is something wrong with the first episode. It does not download properly. I don't know if the file is corrupt or what, but I tried downloading it again, and it didn't work. The second episode works fine, but since this podcast is serialized, I obviously can't listen to episode two until I've listened to episode one! Please fix this ASAP and send me a downloadable version of episode 1!	I was excited to see that, finally, the first episode was available today. Not only that, but so was the second episode!

I just thought of the joke in the title and wanted to put it out there. And what's so bad about jumping the shark? It was actually a great episode of Happy Days. The Fonz jumped over a shark! It's time we take back the term and use it to mean ""a slight turn in direction of a beloved entertainment program that, in hindsight, will not really change how we feel about said program""."

When will this race really begin? Never mind, that's kind of stupid of me to say. It is very great though, and it seems to just be getting better and better! Is he really innocent? Wow!
