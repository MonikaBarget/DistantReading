6,The_Real_Honest_Reviewer,20230222T040224,1,"Gross, Unveiled Racism With No Journalism In Sight","If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, ""Nice White Parents"" is not for you. If you want a hate piece targeting white people, then enjoy this misleading propaganda. This podcast spews a slanted viewpoint that white parents are everything, and the only things, wrong with NYC schools. Whether they enroll their kids, fail to enroll them, run the PTA or merely participate — it is all criticized as the narrator tries to prove her prejudiced point of view. This self-proclaimed ""reporter"" admits in episode 5 that she ignored evidence of white parents working on yet another integration plan because she decided, without any investigation, that their effort was inadequate and uninformed. All the while she criticizes every move white parents make, she refuses to criticize the POC who wrongly accuse the white PTA parents of stealing money. She neither acknowledged the fact that the non white students clearly don't want the white students present nor criticized their blatant racism. And while belittling the participating white PTA parents (sole reason: their participation numbers are higher than nonwhite participants), she gives a free pass to the non-white parents who chose not to participate. She never asked why aren't the minority parents more involved. Instead, she apportions all the fault of the NY school inequality to white parents — and only white parents — while inadequately trying to prove that everything white parents do is wrong. I listened because Sarah Koenig's name is attached. I am embarrassed that she put her name on such poorly reported project. I expected more from Sarah. Her credibility has taken a hit by this lackluster race-baiting piece. The narrator here only researched, or only included, facts and opinions that support her desired story-outcome. She did not diligently follow facts; she selectively sought ones that aligned with the woke, white-shaming picture she sought to paint. This is only half a story and it was told with the sole purpose of making an anti-white propaganda statement. This was a shameful and gross misuse of this formerly-reputable platform. I'd give negative stars if possible.","If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, “Nice White Parents” is not for you.

12,msh441,20230205T195636,3,Infatuation And Prioritization,"Great podcast series. Very well produced. I think season 1 and Adnan's case / exhortation in particular is a couple well spoken women (Koenig and McLean) becoming infatuated with a charismatic killer. A single witness in a library (McLean), some collected evidence that was deeming to be unrelated, and different interpretations of cell phone tower data is enough to ignore several eyewitness who were present when Jay and Adnan spoke about the crime, call recipients, and physical evidence that matches testimony. The explanation presented is 'witnesses forget', and dependence on tower data, from towers that have changed over the years. Specifically how they prioritize and hand off calls. Koenig should've spoken with Hae's friends and family more. The 'possessive stalker' behavior exhibited by Adnan was brushed over in episode 1, and never again comes up!?! Because Koenig is infatuated with him. A fact she acknowledges in multiple episodes. Adnan ultimately benefitted from stoked racial tensions of the day, and is a free man today.","Great podcast series. Very well produced.

A stoned liberal at the time with little to no critical thinking skills, I wholeheartedly bought the notion that perhaps Adnan was innocent. I relistened to season 1 recently and concluded that yea, he totally did it and the podcast gives Adnan the benefit of EVERY doubt pointing to racism and xenophobia as the reasons why our justice system could possibly find him guilty. I certainly don't know what really happened, but I know Adnan is a liar or at least he's a half liar with an awful spotty memory. Season 2 was ok, but boring. Bergdahl was painted a bit too rosey in my opinion. I couldn't get past episode one with season 3 out of sheer boredom and disinterest in swallowing anymore propaganda, so I can't fairly comment. Based on the comments I'm reading, don't waste your time unless you can believe the hogwash information coming from media concerning Covid the last couple of years. I'm not even a dyed in the wool Republican, but trash like what this podcast and others adjacent like it (NYT, NPR, etc) are dishing out is pushing me more and more towards conservatism.","Season 1 of Serial was the first podcast I ever listened to and opened the door to the podcasting world.

Journalism is about providing the facts and letting the audience make up their own opinions, not providing your own opinions and telling the audience what to think.

However, these last few episodes ""We were three"" lost all credibility when it reported about Covid and the treatments for Covid and the comments made about those drug treatments. Yet, the reporter didn't state a single fact, didn't reference a single study done regarding these treatments, didn't reference any studies done on vaccines, or anything medical findings in relation to proof of statement they were making about Covid treatments! It's sad to see the New York Times is still stuck on one side and not able to look at all the evidence before reporting on important subjects like Covid. I have a book I can refer you to if you'd like that is full of pages and pages and pages of numbers, studies, that prove your podcast had many inaccuracies!

The deep dive of the first season, the nuanced new take on a story that had been heavily but shallowly covered by media in the second. Then the third season came around. It opens with an anecdote about a woman blaring music on a speaker in a courthouse elevator. The lawyers and courthouse workers in the elevator were judgmental. Why would anyone be judgmental of someone with a complete lack of social awareness being obnoxious? The narrator gives us the reason: racism. This is the depth of critical thinking for the next two seasons. Why does the criminal justice system favor people with money and influence? Racism. Why do wealthy people take an interest and get involved in their children's education? Racism. It's tiring. The first two seasons were great because they looked at the stories from different angles. Bergdahl was demonized by the press as a uniquely cowardly traitor, the reality was more complex involving hundreds of awol troops, untreated mental illness, and a military desperate enough for numbers it would look the other way. Adnan was a convicted murderer, case closed, but there was ambiguity and uncertainty in the evidence. Season 3 and 4: No complexity or nuance is worth exploring apparently.

Your work shows brilliantly and honestly both how important investigative journalism remains to the functioning of democracy and how impotent it has become in the face of deeply embedded racism and corruption. I particularly loved how transparently you dealt with the issue of ""objectivity"" — a loaded and culturally relative term which should have been interrogated and abandoned in the US journalistic sphere long ago. Brian's pique at the apparent violation of objectivity on the part of Hamza was profoundly revealing. I'm so glad you included that in the series. I also loved how there is no gotcha at the end.

Tracing the history of one school district certainly allows one to see trends in behavior over time. This is a great in-depth examination.

Cons: Too often, the author tries to over-generalize, arguing that the problems of the NYC school system are problems everywhere with little proof. However, sometimes she does state the NYC is unique in being the most segregated school system in America (Ep 5), therefore occasionally demonstrating that some of these problems are unique to this type of school system.

The comments show people will run back to the same arguments over and over again, which is why this country is still where it is. The podcast is older so the term systemic racism isn't as popular yet. The message is clear. Children do not have equal opportunity. Parents that have time to petition or have their staff petition for their children, are not the norm. Children that misbehave one year should not suffer for the rest of their school career. The author is right, you can't measure nice! And you can't punish kids because both parents have to work or they can't afford a French tutor and so on. I would listen, with an open mind. Is it going to attack you personally? Yes. You'll be ok though. This author isn't solving anything but telling a story and an outcome, which we all can take lessons from.

We can all agree we don't want segregated schools. We don't want some kids getting a worse education than others. But when white kids/parents moved into this school and created diversity, and had a different way of doing things, they were admittedly unwanted. I agree the fundraising gala seemed extravagant but at the end of the day it raised money for the kids so who cares? Just because it's not the way you do things? Why is everyone so mad about what everyone else is doing? That parent (Rob I think was his name) had connections and know-how with fundraising and he brought the benefits to this school. What is the problem. Then the teacher you tried to paint as racist for sending her kids to a different school to get away from what she described as disruptive students. She said nothing of race. If the kids happened to be Latino or black, how is that her fault? Maybe if their parents taught them how to behave respectfully there wouldn't have been an issue. Then I thought I'd try to listen for 5 more minutes and you go into the ""gifted"" program. Oohhhh my god. You literally said the white kids are performing better than the other kids at the school. But then you imply that the gifted program is unfair because most of these kids are white and are there BECAUSE they're white. Do they get no credit for their merit? Why is this ongoing narrative so one-sided? WHY are the white kids doing better? Do they have better support in the home? Do their parents work more with them after school? You like to say you're pro-diversity and believe in ""inclusion"" of everyone, but really you have all the biases you're claiming that white people have.","Trying to listen to Nice White Parents with an open mind.

562,garshnarwhal,20200829T142554,1,Biased,"The first episode is irresponsible and I am not compelled to listen to the rest. The school was in danger of closing so they tried heavily to recruit more neighborhood kids to the school, which were well to do white kids. They were successful in large part due to one man taking an interest and organizing the community to enroll an influx of new kids. This man also raised tens of thousands of dollars for the school and started a French language immersion program with the principal's full blessing. Now the school is doing well and it is much more diverse. Diversity is supposed to be great for learning and creativity. Sounds great right? First of all, unless there is no choice, no one of any race wants their kid to be one of only a few in a race/class in a school. That is why, in fact, so many at the school were uncomfortable with the integration of whites into the school. But the reporter takes sides here. This reporter gives a megaphone to a few people in the school who are both resistant to change and power hungry. They are mad that many of the donations are made into a foundation that takes away their control of how to spend it and keeps the donor intent. They had no interest in fundraising to start with. Why don't they keep doing their lackluster job of raising funds since they were so happy with the $2k a year they were raising. They are also mad that the principal did not insist on a language immersion of languages many of the children already spoke. Let me ask you what would the kids be learning then? Why does the reporter talk to these couple people on the PTA so many times more than the other side? She is trying to justify their inflexibility and anger. But she does not succeed. Why would you assume that the non-white kids would not want to learn French or benefit from the programs and funds raised for the school by these white parents? Maybe this first generation of inflexible kids won't but I assure you the next set of classes would begin to matriculate in. Very shortsighted observations here. I am a liberal leaning person but I just can't see how the developments at this school can be seen as anything other than a good thing. Maybe not perfect, but certainly not deserving of a serial podcast to call them out as racists when they are trying their best to integrate and improve this school.

The story teller seemed to want him to be guilty, even though the evidence showed otherwise. I hate that they didn't continue to follow this story, it is much more interesting and shows the flaws of the ""justice"" system in our country. 
They ran off to do season 2 it was not interesting to me. Feel bad that he was a pow for 5 years, consequences for poor choices. His story didn't need to be told. Her compassion and understanding for his was amazing compared to how she believed a 17 year old honor student was a murderer. I wonder how much race played apart in her handling of the 2 men??? Season 3 is offensive only listened to 2 episodes it was disgraceful and disgustingly racist. And no change in that system is coming to that courthouse."

1322,Felix Snow,20190130T174725,1,Very Left-Leaning Angle,"While I like the first season, the third season reveals a very anti-police, anti-white slant that I find offputting. I know police officers in Cleveland and they say that they are sick of all the black crime and if they do anything forceful to detain a black criminal, they are under intense scrutiny. The commentator practically laughs at police who say they aren't going to change anything about the way they handle crime. She thinks the way they handle black suspects is racist - when it is not. I know cops handle criminals the same - whether black or white. If anything, they are more lenient on black criminals because of the intense media bias they face all the time. So I strongly dislike the third season. Again, it's become mainstream - so controlled by a leftist agenda - which is wrong.","While I like the first season, the third season reveals a very anti-police, anti-white slant that I find offputting.

I'll allow that the defendant is often simultaneously a victim of vengeful, racist, immoral police officers and overzealous judges and prosecutors, but at the end of the day, these defendants/victims are criminals at their core and require at least rehabilitation and retribution at worst. As Sarah herself has asked, do they have a choice? Unequivocally, yes. Whether it's not walking around with a blunt or walking away from a bad situation, they always have a choice. I hope as I continue to follow this season that Sarah and the rest of the Serial team dig into the criminals a little more skeptically. I also hope we refocus on the courthouse and less on these particular cases which are interesting but not deeply intriguing or demonstrative.","Listening to Season 3, I enjoy and appreciate Sarah and Emmanuel’s line of questioning and investigative research however often it sounds like they are siding with the defendant.

I'm interested in law school, so hearing the perspective of the attorneys and what their daily work was like was great to hear for me personally, but the obvious bias in this season started to become obnoxious after a couple of episodes in. As someone with a criminal justice background, I absolutely agree that the system has flaws, that the justice system sentences minorities on a harsher scale across the country than whites, and that lengthy sentences do not deter crime. There is plenty of research to support this, but this season does little to actually support that with these stories. I feel like the constant argument is that the criminals interviewed for these stories, who are committing crimes over and over again (by their own choice most of the time), are somehow not to blame for their actions. Police brutality is certainly real and it happens, and I think in some of these reports it really happened and should've been punished, but I feel this season just painted everyone who works in the justice system, especially in Ohio, as racist and as if they have zero good intentions. It felt like an hour long blame game session, without any type of suggestion for how they would recommend fixing these issues. I'm generally left leaning in politics, but I just couldn't get over how wide a brush Serial used to paint everyone in a negative light except the habitual offenders. Oh and she absolutely lost me over the sentencing of the guy who shot the baby. I absolutely agree with that prosecutor. The season was okay. But it was that—just okay.","I loved season 1, and mostly liked season 2 (though it wasn’t as interesting but was still worth listening to), but season 3—I just couldn’t get excited about.

Not because of the production value or reporting, which is very good, but because of the stupid comments made every now and then. Exp: Episode 1 season three is filled with your typical leftist dumb comments about feminism racism etc. For example, the host tells the girl who is being prosecuted for battery on a police officer something to the effect of, weren't you afraid of talking that way to a cop? And the girl responds, well no because I am a white girl. And the host says, I know exactly what she means. Then later on, come to find out the girl has a criminal record. So rather than reporting that she has been around cops for parts of her life and probably has become a bit jaded towards them this resulting in her not being afraid of speaking badly, the host panders towards racism. Give me a break. There are other examples too but this review is getting too long. Typical liberal reporting.","So after season one I had given this podcast a 5 star review.

1875,Moldy Taco,20180925T165202,2,"Great Content, But World View Shaped By Racial Groups","I loved the first two seasons of serial. Amazing content, good audio, and just overall fantastic stories to listen to. I've listened to the first two episodes of the third season and they are riddled with comments about racial groups and the narrators belief in their supreme importance in the justice system. Comments that lay out the racial make up of the judges, and who they preside over in their courtrooms. Do racial groups factor into how cases are decided? Yes, but the comments made by the narrator make it seem as if racial groups are the most important factor. That a white Irish catholic judge is not an individual, and that he or she can't possibly judge a case fairly that involves black people. I'm very disappointed in the comments made throughout these two episodes of season three, racial groups are made up of individuals and that's why we all have different names. Otherwise you might as well as just call people by their race and sex, ""black man, or Asian woman"". This world view is childish, and slanderous to the individuals in the story who get labeled as ""old white men"" with no comments to support the claim that they aren't fairly presiding over the cases before them due to race. Not once did they pause to clarify what they were trying to say, just threw out racial comments flippantly.","I loved the first two seasons of serial.

The only problem we have with this podcast is that it felt too drawn out and really repetitive. It seemed like a lot of the information was said over and over It seemed like all the attention was on Jay and there wasn't enough exposition about the other characters. The narrator, Sarah Koenig, we felt was partially biased towards Adnan and him being not guilty. We'd highly recommend this to anyone into mysteries and thrilling conspiracies.","Overall this podcast was quite enjoyable we loved the story and the narration was very helpful with telling the case of Hae Min Lee.

I was hoping it would end in a confession so the family could at least get that. I can hear the lies in this guy but the host can't. Justice has been served, let the family have peace. The least thing he could be would be an accomplice, after all he spent the day with the guy who knew where the victim's car was. The host is just asking us to put that little tidbit aside?So why all the second guessing? It was either masterfully planned by Jay who had no deep attachment to the victim or like it is in 95% of cases due to the ex boyfriend being hurt and jealous. Why even look at serial killers.? Why would Jay help a strange serial killer hide a car and pin it on the ex? Jays story knew when phone calls were made and places they went before they even had the phone record to match his story. I would expect a few inaccuracies, but the overall story held, he saw a body in the trunk of a car and had details, liars don't have those kind of details. I think the host became infatuated with the murderer, this could be easily settled, just ask Adnon to do a polygraph, any wrongfully imprisoned person would be begging for a polygraph. My guess his response would be, ""I would love to but my lawyer forbids me...."" I feel bad a family had to suffer with this being brought up again for our entertainment, I was very interested.","I have been hooked listening to this show, I do think however the narrator has an attachment and visceral need to convince herself and others this guy is innocent.
