6,The_Real_Honest_Reviewer,20230222T040224,1,"Gross, Unveiled Racism With No Journalism In Sight","If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, ""Nice White Parents"" is not for you. If you want a hate piece targeting white people, then enjoy this misleading propaganda. This podcast spews a slanted viewpoint that white parents are everything, and the only things, wrong with NYC schools. Whether they enroll their kids, fail to enroll them, run the PTA or merely participate — it is all criticized as the narrator tries to prove her prejudiced point of view. This self-proclaimed ""reporter"" admits in episode 5 that she ignored evidence of white parents working on yet another integration plan because she decided, without any investigation, that their effort was inadequate and uninformed. All the while she criticizes every move white parents make, she refuses to criticize the POC who wrongly accuse the white PTA parents of stealing money. She neither acknowledged the fact that the non white students clearly don't want the white students present nor criticized their blatant racism. And while belittling the participating white PTA parents (sole reason: their participation numbers are higher than nonwhite participants), she gives a free pass to the non-white parents who chose not to participate. She never asked why aren't the minority parents more involved. Instead, she apportions all the fault of the NY school inequality to white parents — and only white parents — while inadequately trying to prove that everything white parents do is wrong. I listened because Sarah Koenig's name is attached. I am embarrassed that she put her name on such poorly reported project. I expected more from Sarah. Her credibility has taken a hit by this lackluster race-baiting piece. The narrator here only researched, or only included, facts and opinions that support her desired story-outcome. She did not diligently follow facts; she selectively sought ones that aligned with the woke, white-shaming picture she sought to paint. This is only half a story and it was told with the sole purpose of making an anti-white propaganda statement. This was a shameful and gross misuse of this formerly-reputable platform. I'd give negative stars if possible.","If you seek unbiased or fact-based reporting, “Nice White Parents” is not for you.

245,666oclock,20211209T083934,3,S3+=Boring,"The first 2 seasons of Serial are some of the most memorable podcasting I can think of. It feels like y'all fell into the guilty ""woke"" white people pressure of trying to cover relevant news S3 onward, but it's profoundly boring and I can't stand to listen ever since. There are so many other podcasts doing this work and in a way that isn't this tedious to listen to. S1 + S2 were so incredible because it felt like a film that got perfectly treated into podcast form in a way that was still incredibly relevant today's news and culture. Both of those first two seasons say way more about the country we've become than the desperate fake woke white person journalism happening in S3+. I appreciate your work, I just wish you all would return to form and to what made Serial so incredible in the first place, long form is where you shine. Please consider how trite it is to add to the noise the way these last few years of content do. It feels like content by people for white people to feel better during a civil rights crisis, whereas S1 and S2 feel accessible to everyone and have a huge impact that simultaneously provide startling commentary on the current culture. Sorry this is so long, it's been bothering me that every time I check for more Serial, it's just this same bloated fake-woke, current-climate journalism that we're already inundated with everywhere. It's very sanitized when you come to think of it! And Serial started out so much bigger than that!","The first 2 seasons of Serial are some of the most memorable podcasting I can think of.

318,Jeannieplake,20210521T110324,1,Didn'T Listen,"I was so much of a Serial fan that it is unbelievable. I started the first episode a couple of times and had the impression that this was going to be WOKE nonsense so I stopped and said I would go back later. When I opened the podcast this morning The reviews caught my eyes. I normally don't read the reviews because all of us enjoy something different. But once I read the reviews I was certain that I wasn't going to listen because I knew listening to this would only make me feel angry inside. I am tired of Young people who don't know what they're talking about dividing this country with their WOKE ideology. Honestly, if I were a black person in America I would be insulted that this generation think I too stupid to wipe my own butt. I come from mixed race. My great grandfather was an African Slave. TRUST me when I say, none of us were or are stupid and anyone thinking that you can't rise above the color of your skin in modern America is not well educated. So no thank you Sarah, I'm taking a pass on this on and hitting the ole unfollow button.","I was so much of a Serial fan that it is unbelievable.

544,SilverDollar007,20200907T172905,1,"""Nice White Woke Writers""","That's what this series should be called. I made it through three episodes but grew tired of the racist bias toward white people. These liberal white woke writers insist on blaming everything on white people. When does personal responsibility come into play? Many people choose to maintain their low standards and resent it when others come in with higher expectations. Why is it that the ones who constantly point out a person's race also happen to be those on the left? When will they stop pointing out differences and instead focus on the commonalities and ideals that unite us? When it stops being profitable for them. The media continue their work to divide this country along racist lines. What happened to considering a person's character before their color? I predict it will soon backfire. Check out Freedom, Georgia to see how black people are segregating themselves from white people so they can feel ""safe"". And they are promoting this as a solution to black people all around the country. Will the woke white people try to infiltrate the black self-segregation areas? This could get interesting.
