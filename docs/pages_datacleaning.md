## Data cleaning

Up to a range of about 50000 social media posts, data can still be cleaned semi-manually in EXCEL or a browser-based cleaning tool. More data usually cause severe performance issues, so cleaning via script is recommended. The following script permits the cleaning of all kinds of social media collected in .txt format, with a special focus on deleting @ signs, hashtags, URLs and emojis:

Tool recommended for cleaning structured data (e.g. in CSV and EXCEL format): [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/)
