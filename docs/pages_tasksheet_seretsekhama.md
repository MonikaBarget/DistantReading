# Interracial marriage in colonial times

A United Kingdom is a 2016 biographical romantic drama film based on the true-life romance of Seretse Khama, 
heir to the throne of the Bangwato Tribe in Serowe, with his British wife Ruth Williams Khama.
Serowe was then part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which was established by the UK in 1885 and, after independence,
became the Republic of Botswana.

The couple faced many obstacles and discriminations although Seretse Khama came from a royal African family and received an excellent education,
studying law in England. Have things changed since Botswana`s indepencende in the 1960s, and can couples coming from different cultural and ethnic
backgrounds now enjoy a better life? Have opinions about the relationship between Seretse and Anne changed in hindsight? And what can we learn from how their
relationship was and is discussed in terms of a larger postcolonial discourse?
