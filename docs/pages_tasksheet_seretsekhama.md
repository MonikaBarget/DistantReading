# Interracial marriage in colonial times

A United Kingdom is a 2016 biographical romantic drama film based on the true-life romance of Seretse Khama, 
heir to the throne of the Bangwato Tribe in Serowe, with his British wife Ruth Williams Khama.
Serowe was then part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which was established by the UK in 1885 and, after independence,
became the Republic of Botswana.

The couple faced many obstacles and discriminations although Seretse Khama came from a royal African family and received an excellent education,
studying law in England. Have things changed since Botswana`s indepencende in the 1960s, and can couples coming from different cultural and ethnic
backgrounds now enjoy a better life? Have opinions about the relationship between Seretse and Anne changed in hindsight? And what can we learn from how their
relationship was and is discussed in terms of a larger postcolonial discourse?

The data sets suggested below may help you get some insights.

## Idea for further data analysis: historical novels that cover romantic relations across perceived color boundaries

For your final essays or in future research, you may also want to explore how historical novels address romantic relationships across perceived color boundaries. Take, for instance, Vanessa Riley's book "Island Queen," which offers a fictionalised account of the life of [Dorothy Kirwan Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Thomas_(entrepreneur)) â€” a freed woman of color who rose from slavery to become a prominent landowner in the colonial West Indies. This detailed first-person narrative highlights how the main character navigates family ties, business connections and several romantic relationships despite social constraints:
