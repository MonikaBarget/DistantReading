## Research strategies for data collection

Finding sufficient data for a topic you are interested in can be challening, also because relevant data may not include the most obvious keywords. Here is some advice to identifying
useful data sets by source.

### Finding podcast, games, books etc. with sufficient reviews on the Apple Store

### Developing useful search terms

Regardless of the search engine or platform you use to find content related to a topic, it is important to carefully develop your search terms. Mistakes that students often make
is that their search terms are either too broad or much too narrow. For example, searching for a podcast on "history" will give you more results than you can process, and it will not help you to create or answer a clear research question.
Instead of searching for “history,” you may want to search for “medieval history in France” to get a more manageable list of results. One example of the opposite challenge is that a student
of mine in a past course tried to find podcasts on "genital mutilation" but the few results that came up had absolutely no reviews they could analyse. In such cases, it is recommended
to branch out and consider related aspects such as female bodies, female sexuality, or violence against women. 

#### Use Apple store search feature
        
You can directly open the Apple podcasts app on your device for research, but you should be aware that reviews may only be visible when you open the show / episode website.
This is a special challenge for MAC users as their machines tend to automatically re-direct to the app. Also, you have to consider that searching by keywords in the Apple Store
will only give you limited results because the search engine focuses on podcast titles and the short podcast descriptions. If your keyword is not mentioned, a relevant podcast may
not come up as a result, so using external research tools is recommended.

### Podcast aggregators and airectories

Websites like Podchaser, Listen Notes, or Spotify often list top-rated and specialised podcasts. You can often filter podcasts by subject, reviews, and popularity.
After finding relevant podcasts, check whether they are available on Apple Podcasts. Most professional podcasts are on Apple.

### Explore Social Media & Forums:

Platforms like X, Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, Reddit, and Facebook groups often have communities of podcast listeners who discuss and recommend shows.
Subreddits like r/podcasts can be a great source for finding highly recommended or niche podcasts. You can also consider asking other social media users for their
podcast recommendations on a specific topic.

### Generative AI (GenAI) for podcast search

In the MA DC course "Machines of Knowledge", students are explicitly allowed to use ChatGPT (or similar tools) to get Podcast recommendations for their topics.
However, the quality of the results that AI suggests varies greatly. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary to double-check if podcasts really exist, if they are available on Apple,
if they cover the topic of interests, and if URLs provided by AI are correct.

Students can directly prompt AI by asking for general recommendations, e.g.
      
           *“Can you recommend podcasts about the history of technology available on Apple Podcasts?”*

In my experience, this often gives you few and not necessarily recent results, so it is better to explicitly ask for a certain number of podcasts and specify if you want
results from a particular time period or country:

*“Give me the top 5 podcasts produced after 2018 about ancient history that are available on Apple Podcasts.”*

Another strategy can be to provide AI with the names of podcasts that the student already knows to ask for similar content. Moreoever, AI can also help generate relevant
search terms for a subject to make finding podcasts via Google etc. easier. When a student wants to work with podcasts on “women’s rights,” for example, AI can suggest related topics like
“feminism,” “gender equality,” or “reproductive health” to broaden the search. In all cases where you use AI, it is vital to make transparent in graded assignments why you used it and what prompts
you gave the tool.
