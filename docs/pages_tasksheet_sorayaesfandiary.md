# (Post)colonial challenges of identity

## The problem of choosing or defining sides in colonial controversies

Historical border-crossing in the form of white abolitionism: what is "postcolonial" about it, what is inherently colonial? Prominent figures to consider icnlude Thomas Clarkson (* 1760)
 and Elizabeth Heyrich (1769-1831) to Benjamin Lay (1682-1759). The latter is particularly interested because he was not only white but a member of the Quakers and physically disabled, thus
 experiencing marginalisations of his own.

 When does "postcolonialism" begin historically, is it the same as "anti-colonialism", and who can legitimately present postcolonial concerns?

 In more recent history, we also find border crossing of a different kind: people who have a family background in a colonised region but grow up in "the West" and subsequently struggle with their identities.
