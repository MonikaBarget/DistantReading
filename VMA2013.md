<h2>Cultural background</h2>

<p align="justify">As an example of a social media event that can be analysed via distant reading, I have chosen the 2013 MTV music awards performance by Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke.

The controversial performance was extensively covered on Twitter and still incited comments and comparisons years later.</p>

<p align="justify">At the time of the actual event in 2013, one of the most frequently retweeted posts with 372 retweets was <a href="https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/372040980910067713">a photo of the Smith family's reaction shared by @thejeremyvine.</a> Of course, this user was by far not the only person who disseminated the same or a similar picture.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2022, a <a href="https://twitter.com/milesholy/status/1488596498753499142">post relating to a mannequin wearing an imitation of Miley Cyrus's VMA2013 outfit</a> got 3608 retweets and 35700 likes. According to the Spanish-language post, dressing the mannequin in this way was meant as criticism. The post also stated that Miley's reaction was to take a photo of herself "with a mannequin that looked like a donkey."</p>

<p align="justify">In general, the Twitter controversy started by the VMA 2013 was very much an <em>image war</em> in which people shared videos, original photographs, collages or memes to express their opinions. When collecting a data set for distant reading, it is therefore vital to take the high number of tweets without text into account and to harvest tweets relating to several keywords and hashtags.</p>

<p align="justify">Another challenge of this particular controversy is that the number of replies or commented retweets considerably outweighs the number of original tweets (using clearly identifiable hashtags), which is some ready-made tools for harvesting tweets may only capture a tiny fraction of what is available. The Web Data Research Assistant developed in Southampton, for instance, tends to ignore text in replies. Gathering tweets on different aspects of the VMA2013 debate (e.g. the impact of the show on children), I was able to collect 33006 initial items via WDRA, but having deleted duplicates, tweets that only had visual content, and replies that came in as empty cells, only 320 unique tweets with meaningful content were left. Depending on your research question, WDRA may therefore not be the best tool to use and you should consider alternatives. The most efficient way of harvesting social media data is, of course, to use the official APIs and scripts (e.g. in Python and R) that can be customised to suit your case studies. Using code, however, requires advanced skills.</p>

<h2>Challenges of the Twitter query</h2>

As Miley Cyrus's performance incited 306,000 tweets per minute, the data that we can collect on the event are "big data", indeed. However, this does not mean that such a huge data set is easy to analyse. On the contrary, some central keywords such as the names of the performers will become even more prominent in the data set the more tweets we collect, which can make using a word cloud and other visualisation tools very difficult. Finding sub-themes such as the representation of women or cultural appropriation in the data therefore requires a more careful pre-selection.

<h3>1) First Twitter query with more generic keywords:</h3>

<code>'query': '("miley" OR "cyrus" OR #miley OR #mileycyrus OR #robinthike OR @mileycyrus) ("vma2013" OR #vma2013 OR "performance" OR "vma" OR #vma OR "tv") lang:en'</code>

<h3>2) Second Twitter query with more specific keywords:</h3>

<code>'query': '("miley" OR "cyrus" OR #miley OR #mileycyrus OR #robinthike OR "robin" OR @mileycyrus) 
                ("vma2013" OR #vma2013 OR "performance" OR "vma" OR #vma OR #twerking OR "tv" OR "stage" OR "women"
OR "children" OR "family" OR "culture" OR "black" OR "appropriation" OR "hip hop" OR "people of color" OR "dancers" OR "finger") lang:en',</code>

<h3>2) Third Twitter query with specific keywords but excluding retweets:</h3>

<code>'query': '("miley" OR "cyrus" OR #miley OR #mileycyrus OR #robinthike OR "robin" OR @mileycyrus) 
                ("vma2013" OR #vma2013 OR "performance" OR "vma" OR #vma OR #twerking OR "tv" OR "stage" OR "women"
OR "children" OR "family" OR "culture" OR "black" OR "appropriation" OR "hip hop" OR "people of color" OR "dancers" OR "finger") lang:en',</code>

In all cases, the search focused on the time between 1 July 2013 and 1 October 2013, thus covering debates before and directly after the performance. 

<h2>Challenges of the analysis<h2>
  
  <li>Frequent use of slang, e.g. "molly" for the drug MDMA / Ecstasy: <em>Miley Cyrus Was She On Molly During the VMA Show? #molly #MileyCyrus #VMAs</em></li>
  <li>Visual communication through images and emojis is lost in the text analysis</li>
  <li>Many tweets are very short, e.g. <em>Miley Cyrus on chatty man tonight. should be interesting #twerking</em></li>
  <li>Even is linked with an abundance of hashtags that create cross-references in the community, e.g. <em>#MileyCyrus #Thicke #Gaga #1D and #Bieber sound so much better with these #Beats</em></li>
  <li>Twitters users heavily on sharing links to video clips relating to the event (many URLs in data set)</li>
