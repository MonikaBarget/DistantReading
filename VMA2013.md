<p align="justify">As an example of a social media event that can be analysed via distant reading, I have chosen the 2013 MTV music awards performance by Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke.

The controversial performance was extensively covered on Twitter and still incited comments and comparisons years later.</p>

<p align="justify">At the time of the actual event in 2013, one of the most frequently retweeted posts with 372 retweets was a photo of the Smith family's reaction shared by @thejeremyvine.</p>

<p align="justify">Of course, this user was by far not the only person who used the same picture.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2022, a post relating to a mannequin wearing an imitation of Miley Cyrus's VMA2013 outfit got 3608 retweets and 35700 likes. The Spanish-language post
stated that Miley's reaction was to take a photo of herself "with a mannequin that looked like a donkey."</p>
