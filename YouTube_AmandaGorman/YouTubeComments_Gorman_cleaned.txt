these things are a drag no money in my pocket amanda gormans poem joe biden as president and the sun shining on my face
she is breathtaking yes the sad part when the government is involved the shade will stay in so many ways paying immigrants a great sum when our hardworking people are limited our social security our soldiers killed when coming out of afghanistanbut the lord above is our hope and i believe has given this special lady a very special heart
i found this a bit verbose
lets go brandon
what i thought trump was still prez
so inspiring

she gave me swedish homework
what an annoying rhetorical style
its interesting to listen to amanda gormans brilliant poem and to see it was obvious to everyone and definitely to amanda what had happened so in the future when people say they didnt know they are lying  we have seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded 
@jonny propaganda trump might be elected again in 2024
history has a big fat library of their traitorous acts one of the most shameful periods in american history we dont talk about trump losers anymore were the future
this is amazing
9k dislikes jealous people lol
nice poem but you need to be realistic people do not get along that is the way the world will always be
well i think she agrees with that quiet does not always mean peace pretty much says that people only get along on the surface but their discontent should be expressed
much better than donalds circus show haha
jimmy neutron head ahh

so touching for an excellent video
lol whatever you say
you communists couldnt win the election legitimately so you stole it by using mail in voting joe biden is an illegitimate president correction an illegitimate dictator
yawn hi russia
041
her words historically approach lincolns addresses in its fluency someday maybe she will be a leader and this poem speech as an opening to her future
america didnt elect dementia joe
@carol smith russia this is pathetic youre fresh out of fools to gaslight
@jonny propaganda joe and kamala dont trust president trumps vaccine https//youtube/b8illjbvkus
@carol smith got it how dare he fulfill traitor trumps commitments how dare he end the other sham war you guys started yall are really reaching for anything anymore
@stephon growing upthiss how our president got 80 million votes https//youtube/eqigb5rm8ak
@jonny propagandajoe biden is fast becoming the most embarrassing president in us history https//youtube/pwxnl6zrn4u
yup by a friggen landslide proven by 60 courts but note we dont care if you make fun of biden your old us vs them doesnt work i would have voted for a rock vs traitor failure trump
we did
* more pronounced than the theory of relativity* _regards _ 
they literally said white translator is not capable to translate whether gormans poetry because he is not black this is white racism do not call antiwhite movement or white racism because it is just racism and it is so obvious to understand so im saying black actors/actresses shouldnt play hamlet or romeo and juliet because they are not black and they are not capable to understand white hetero love sometimes im so happy to say thank god im not from america
where are you from i follow your logic
wonderful poet
cool amazing for a black woman mediocre for every other ethnicity
you sould very much like a racist
her inspirational words of hope went right over the heads of all the racists on here
some people will never understand the power we have when we eliminate the evilness from a creature no longer pure enough to be glorified in the presence of god therefore him and his followers ejected and now finds pleasure in watching mankind miss the opportunity to elope as one by finding the weak to keep us apart theyre also hitting that dislike button
hope tis is a one time opportunity it realy sucks
the kind of ebony i like 
eww thats coming off as quite sexist and like you got some type of closed mind going on there
she gave me homework
so grateful for such beauty she makes me cry
if were to live up to our own time well come together under jesus wow this poem
we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another that made me physically jump
love it 
men in general judge more by the sense of sight than by the sense of touch because everyone can see but few can test by feeling  everyone sees what you seem to be few know what you really are and those few do not dare take a stand against the general opinion
0040 the dawn im sorry im a big the weeknd fan im sorry guys im just trying to do my english hw
when le black
best ever 
her mom is my english teacher
started listening knew that we would hear something regarding race got it stopped video
me no like information that challenges my caveman brain hulk smash
well amanda gormon tell me how you feel about bidens botched withdrawal from afghanistan and the killing of around 100 people in an isis k suicide bombing that happened as a result
@z floyd because trump never botches anything*** ***if you exclude losing the senate the house georgia arizona the election 60 courtcases re the election international credibility as well as his failed covidresponse insurrection pornstar payoffs university/realestate/hotels/steaks/vodka/marriages/airlines/social media platforms but best of all he has exposed the rotten core of the republican party and having lost all credibility as a governing party yall will never be back tldr enjoy finally being the minority youve always really been
@jonny propaganda true trump made the plan but biden severely botched the plan in a way that trump would not have
good thing traitor trump made that deal with the taliban or is that an inconvenient fact for your personal delusional narrative also biden never started an idiot insurrection nor killed millions of americans with sheer ineptitude and negligence but keep telling yourself whatever makes you feel good
good thing the taliban has our weapons now now theyll have enough man power to destroy isis for good
@geography history geo politics and more what what you are saying makes absolutely no sense first of all what do you mean by by the time biden was in office and secondly the situation in afghanistan absolutely was bidens fault you may say well trump was the one who initiated the withdrawal however if trump was in office he would have actually planned the withdrawal strategically to get as many americans home safely as possible and he definitely would not have had the military leave their weapons for the taliban to use to take over kabul however biden being a weak president botched the withdrawal really badly by 1 having the soldiers leave before the american civilians left and 2 because he had the soldiers leave their military equipment in afghanistan for the taliban to take
sorry trumpist by the time biden was in office most troops from afghanistan had been evacuated
poem for a woke communist
a truly wonderful writer with a nice voice but i find this style of preformative poetry distracting stop moving your hands so much lady
literally made me cry when she did the r run considering that she once had trouble wiynthst legend
when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
there once was a punk from nantucket
people are so easily manipulable
just look at trump traitors right
mr president dr hakainde hichilema madam vice mutale nalumango zambians and the world at large a ford we cross our throats were dry we sought for a stream we asked ourselves about a day to seek less quench our thirsty and live in endless harmony from injustice emanated chaos selectivism sow division taking us back in the time of colonial dominance sadly in recent time the division became amongst ourselves corruption has sullied our beautiful land democracy had been by design tempered withnearly chucked out but the voice of the people gave us a victory we embrace today from afar the whole world witness the beauty of her atmosphere all embraced are without fear filled with subtle feeling of peaceful happiness the world witness a new chapter a fragment of our history full of hope and ambitions for a better landa land of fortune and dignity innovation and free from oppression as well as favourable living conditions a land brimming in joy with bursting relieving love doves in the sky attesting to its beautya safe haven for humanity being the sole citizens of the land is an exceptional privilege we should take pride in it is our inheritance let us help the land to attain its full capacityfilled with light we can make this land an epitome of hard work peace justice and equity that possibility compel us to be disciplined be focused the interest of our land is something we must prioritize we can but it starts on the individual level together as one we may not be perfect but we have a purpose we may be slow but can never falter we may be dirty but have a strong vision as one darkness cannot to prevail the twinkling stars will forever copulate with the sound of a violin because there are no restrictions in imagination you can be who ever you imagined to be working hard is required to put imagination into reality we have imagined before and reimagine a better land now hence together with understanding of the elements attached to hard work and knowing what we are doing the land will become a better place pep you up break fast flakes will never make one a famous ball player it is high time we understood the notion for us to be in motion always focus yields success negligence yields failure and faith yields grace the world knows that the loveliness and beauty of her endowment bring awareness to a man lost in thoughts as though in a hypnotic trance her features are not stories of fancy and that when we divide ourselves everything will fade we can live in unity let us find light as we continuously cross mother zambia sweet music is amor
her identity as a black woman makes this all better than if it was a white man  my fellow liberals

ignoramus afroamerican woman paying tribute to a bigot biden who delivered the eulogy to a former member of the ku klux klan senator robert c byrd
while we have our eye on the future history has an eye on us may we always remember this
@agamemnon of mycenae did you write this poignant and true
history looked at us but we failed to learn from it blinded by the future that we cannot see the present bask in false victories while shirking responsibilities fail your allies cooperate with bad guys see a nation in violence while maintaining radio silence saigon came and went afghanistan left for dead all the while asking 20 years for what

stolen election complete joke biden was installed
@rot earth classic communism lets dive into that what in everything that both you and i said remotely invokes any mention of or reference to communism its like communism is the boogie man to you russian pawn trolltraitors fear ignorance not words
@jonny propaganda you`re incredibly ignorant clinton worked with a russian despot to facilitate lies and innuendo for a dossier against trump common commie tactic is to accuse your enemy of what you`re guilty of the same goes on today biden is on video saying racist things being a pederast there`s emails of criminal conduct yet trump is the called the criminal pervert racist etc classic communism now the world is so incredibly divided and ready to explode all thanks to the billionaires who control large segment of the democratic and republican parties trump probably included
@meggiesaurus by the most votes ever in us presidential elections
lol hi again russia
trump lost get over it
ronald mcdonalds niece  what a clown

gross
boohoo lmao
terrible
@f r lmao then you cant criticize poetry as a whole who are you no one important to the world of poetry why dont you criticize something you are a part of like the society of pointless commenters
@meggiesaurus my ability to write a poem or not does not affect the terrible quality of this poem (or terrible quality of modern poetry in general)
lets see you do that then
when will we put our differences aside liberals love corrosive bloodletting in politics you dont fight an evil by adopting it and practicing it ayn rand
time 26 you are belly of the beast for the great goliath reset
i get goosebumps everytime i hear this her vibe is so positive and ive memorized most of it its words still give me goosebumps every 200th time
while the poem is good and the poet good if misguided she is speaking for a fake president put in power by the very forces she speaks again and the party that put her people in chains in the past and intends to keep them there mentally into the future it is hard that someone this educated can not open her mind to see this but god please spare us from those indoctrinated from lies from the masters of gaslighting
step aside joseph goebbels watch a pro do it
where is her daddt
ugh
as the greatest poet i would like to say that this poem is flawed so im a make a better one
girlwhere yall find this poet from i need to poet donald trump inwhat the hedouble hocky sticks is this as the greatest poet in america i do jot approve

watching gormans recitation of her poem in january i was impressed by her poise but as i expected underwhelmed by her poem occasional poems are notoriously difficult to write well since the writer is obligated to serve the occasion not her imagination however what astonished me was the nearuniversal approbation the poem received including in normally serious quarters such as the new york times now that the poem has been published in book form the critic william logan has taken it on (in the new criterion) logans reviews are famously biting and i would not have expected him to admire the poem still his criticisms are so exactly on point that (in a mainly losing battle no doubt to encourage people to rethink whether gormans work is truly serious and memorable as poetry) i cant help but quote a few of them here that the country was moved [by the poem] is a reminder of how poorly poetry is taught where it is taught at all   [h]er poem was a sorry affair composed of stock metaphors and dreary banalities with the rhymes of a breakfastcereal jingle and the heart of a stockbroker gorman indulged in excruciating puns and gameshowhost wordplay (we lay down our arms / so that we can reach our arms out the norms and notions of what just is / isnt always justice and even worse we seek harm to none and harmony for all) the text was also full of sphinxlike riddles to make a reader of poetry wince and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it / somehow we do it do what exactly (and shouldnt that be was ours) the fragmentary sentences dont help in the opening shed written the loss we carry a sea we must wade she may have intended that the shard be governed by the previous sentence which began where can we find    but where can we find the loss we carry a sea we must wade doesnt make sense or is the sea the loss we carry not even the colossus of rhodes or paul bunyan could wade a sea elsewhere    that is the promised glade / the hill we climb if only we dare it / because being american is more than a pride we inherit / its the past we step into and how we repair it the promised glade really a glade is an open space in a forest so not usually something you can climb and why are we daring the hill (she should have said dare to but she needed a rhyme on inherit) finally the past cant be repairedonly its mistakes no one expects a poet of limited rhetorical gifts and a taste for timeless drivel to write a masterpiece gorman was only twentytwo and perhaps shell be more than a nine days wonder    [t]his keepsake edition of the inaugural poem ought to embarrass poets readers and the famous washington dead

der hugel den wir erklimmen von amanda gorman mr president dr biden madam vice president mr emhoff burger amerikas und der ganzen welt wenn es tag wird fragen wir uns wo wir licht zu finden vermogen in diesem niemals endenden schatten den verlust den wir tragen ein meer das wir durchwaten mussen wir haben dem bauch der bestie getrotzt wir haben gelernt dass ruhe nicht immer frieden bedeutet und dass die normen und vorstellungen von dem was gerade ist nicht immer gerechtigkeit sind [die ubersetzung konnte auch lauten dass die normen und vorstellungen von dem was gerecht ist die betonung legt aber die obige interpretation nahe wahrscheinlich spielt die lyrikerin hier aber bewusst mit der doppelten bedeutung von just anmdubersetzer] und doch gehort die morgendammerung uns noch ehe wir es wussten irgendwie schaffen wir es irgendwie haben wir es uberstanden und bezeugten eine nation die nicht kaputt ist sondern einfach unvollendet wir die nachfahren eines landes und einer zeit in der ein dunnes schwarzes madchen das von sklaven abstammt und von einer alleinerziehenden mutter grogezogen wurde davon traumen kann prasidentin zu werden nur um sich selbst in einer situation zu finden in der sie fur einen vortragt und ja wir sind alles andere als lupenrein alles andere als makellos aber das bedeutet nicht dass wir danach streben eine gemeinschaft zu bilden die perfekt ist wir streben danach gezielt eine gemeinschaft zu schmieden ein land zu bilden das sich allen kulturen farben charakteren und menschlichen lebensverhaltnissen verpflichtet fuhlt und so erheben wir unseren blick nicht auf das was zwischen uns steht sondern auf das was vor uns steht wir schlieen die kluft weil wir wissen dass wir um unsere zukunft an erste stelle zu setzen zuerst unsere unterschiede beiseitelegen mussen wir legen unsere waffen nieder damit wir unsere arme nach einander ausstrecken konnen wir wollen schaden fur keinen und harmonie fur alle lasst die welt wenn sonst auch nichts sagen dass dies wahr ist dass wir selbst als wir trauerten wuchsen dass wir selbst als wir schmerzen litten hofften dass wir selbst als wir ermudeten es weiter versucht haben dass wir fur immer verbunden sein werden siegreich nicht weil wir nie wieder eine niederlage erleben werden sondern weil wir nie wieder spaltung saen werden die heilige schrift sagt uns dass wir uns vorstellen sollen dass jeder unter seinem eigenen weinstock und feigenbaum sitzen soll und keiner ihnen angst machen soll falls wir unserer eigenen zeit gerecht werden sollen dann wird der sieg nicht in der klinge liegen sondern in all den brucken die wir gebaut haben das ist das versprechen der hugel den wir erklimmen wenn wir es nur wagen denn amerikaner zu sein ist mehr als ein stolz den wir erben es ist die vergangenheit in die wir treten und die art wie wir sie reparieren wir haben eine macht gesehen die unsere nation eher zerschlagen wurde als sie zu teilen die unser land zerstoren wurde wenn es dazu fuhre demokratie zu verzogern und dieser versuch war fast erfolgreich doch auch wenn demokratie von zeit zu zeit verzogert werden kann kann sie niemals dauerhaft besiegt werden in diese wahrheit in diesem glauben vertrauen wir denn obwohl wir unsere augen auf die zukunft richten die geschichte hat ihre augen auf uns gerichtet dies ist die ara gerechter wiedergutmachung wir furchteten zu beginn wir fuhlten uns nicht bereit erben einer solch schrecklichen stunde zu sein doch in ihr fanden wir die kraft ein neues kapitel zu schreiben uns selbst hoffnung und lachen zu schenken also wahrend wir uns einst fragten wie wir jemals diese katastrophe uberstehen konnten stellen wir jetzt fest wie konnte eine katastrophe jemals uns uberstehen wir werden nicht zuruck zu dem marschieren was war sondern uns auf das zu bewegen was sein wird ein land das zwar verletzt aber dennoch intakt ist gutig aber kuhn kampferisch und frei wir werden uns nicht umdrehen oder durch einschuchterung unterbrechen lassen weil wir wissen dass unsere untatigkeit und tragheit unser erbe fur die nachste generation sein wird unsere groben fehler werden zu ihren lasten aber eines ist sicher wenn wir barmherzigkeit mit macht verschmelzen und macht mit recht dann wird liebe unser vermachtnis und veranderung das geburtsrecht unserer kinder also lasst uns ein land hinterlassen das besser ist als das welches uns hinterlassen wurde mit jedem atemzug aus meiner bronzegegossenen brust werden wir diese verwundete welt in eine wundersame verwandeln wir werden uns von den goldbeschienenen hugeln des westens erheben wir werden uns aus dem windgepeitschten nordosten erheben in dem unsere vorfahren zum ersten mal die revolution verwirklichten wir werden uns aus den von seen gesaumten stadten des mittleren westens erheben wir werden uns aus dem sonnengebrannten suden erheben wir werden wieder aufbauen uns versohnen und erholen und jeden bekannten winkel unserer nation und jede ecke die unser landes genannt wird unser volk vielfaltig und schon wird aufstreben zerschunden und schon wenn der tag kommt treten wir aus dem schatten heraus entflammt und ohne angst die neue morgendammerung erbluht wenn wir sie befreien denn es gibt immer licht wenn wir nur mutig genug sind es zu sehen wenn wir nur mutig genug sind es zu sein
the oppressed woman who only received a $43000 per year 1  12 year private school education the poor thing  and she also suffered through a harvard college oh and education debt  her education cradle to grave was paid for by others
this mans dont know what oppression means
she forgot to do the air quotes around doctor biden the air quotes are mandated by those of use who have read her dissertation
i think the message was beautiful but for me the poem was average at best before anyone attacks me i too am a poc woman so that rules out me being racist or sexist i write too and analyze poetry and for me this wasnt it however i am very proud that she delivered such a great performance here and on such a momentous occasion
beautiful

source
how come the first black president and the first female black asian vp were democrat how come most of the black and asian/hispanic congress members and senators are democrats
any evidence for your claim
disgraceful
@larry c indeed anyone linked with politics has a bad image for life
@_bionic_frog_ i dont think the young girl is a disgrace its a disgrace that she did this speech in front of the most corrupt people in the world
youre the disgrace larry c
how used and disposed of do you feel now
this was incredible loved it
thank you having subtitles
didnt even rhyme though
it doesnt need too
my grandma sent this to my
slam poetry is the death of art
sometimes we need the young to remind us to never stop dreaming beautiful

roses are red violets are blue
joe biden i love  you  so much and good to have you
really give me a break
your poetry cant change no man what a coward attack in ny
what ny
wasnt robert frost an american poet
youtube please stop scrubbing my dislikes from joe biden videos
when i hear the sentence because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation  i think of the fact that the usa is the only country in the world who has not ratified the un charta on the rights of the child ( #ratifycrc )  and is one of the few countries in the modern world that does not ban child corporal punishment legally this is unthinkable almost everywhere in europe 
people who dislike are people who got homework
i like amanda gormans poems
im glad you like it
me too
do we really need racist poems read at inaugurations america has lowered the bar from robert frost to this
how is this racist lmao
woahhhh the subtitles are so accurate
everything about her screams look at me look at me look at me me me me me me me
its almost like thats the point of using a microphone and giving a speech in front of a crowd
this poem was in the words of j j from good times dynamite
guh are these things always about hating the previous guy
lol
she has very little talent and too much ego
confidence isnt an ego michael
her poems are beautiful 
thanks for the awesome new gas prices commie joe
@alien pov i guess that makes sense i grew up in a poor family so i kinda understand how pricing and stuff affects people but we never really had a car so it really never came to mind but honestly bidens been causing a lot worse recently hes not a hero hes just slightly less evil than trump
@meggiesaurus no that of course is not my biggest worry but it is a symptom of a much larger illness that increase in price affects many people financially it may not be anything to you it is to many
everything going on in this country and gas prices are what youre worried about
@_bionic_frog_ youre obviously a kid because the gas price is legitimately awful rn
cry
good job
must watch8 yr old jaya winn perform entire poem in honor of amanda gorman
weve learned that quiet isnt always peace
what a c u n t
someones mad boohoo white guy theres worse problems in the world than you getting your feelings hurt and type it with your whole chest next time
how black you are
well this young lady will regret doing this in her lifetime 
no
why
this is not poetry
the only thing worse than this poem is implanting a victim mindset in an american child and exploiting her to fuel your divisive destructive and deadly democrat seeded race war
this poem sucks
bruh all these people degrading her in the comment section are making me lose brain cells
mediocre poetry but this is hailed as wonderful gee i wonder why
racist
how is that racism
@j m j source
@cohen harrison if i found that translators of my poem were judged by the color of their skin and i didnt speak up id be a racist too
did mcdonalds sponsor her outfit for this
lets unite but you cant translate my poem unless you have my skin disgusting can we be honest and admit we are creating a recipe for disaster in for the next generation
amanda smollet
such a boring and under delivered speech i felt really annoyed by the whole ordeal she tried so hard to be the next mlk but to be honest i dont think she was moving at all
the steep slope that we tumble down (retruthed poetry) when dark comes we ask ourselves  where could we even find light in this neverending shame  the loss we carry a void we must make we are the belly of the beast we have to learn mans peace is not true and mans justice is ajustice and the nothing will soon be ours we ignorant man stupid proud nullos scripture tells us usa is to be destroyed because they abandon gods fear they dare to resist god and the steep slope they surely tumble down god will end for ever democracy democracy = nothing people unable to govern themselves unable to choose rightly democracy must be destroyed for ever god listens only those who obey him as cumberland plateau is deserted so all their union is to be it it will and after usa all nations dont do the clevers  signed  someone somewhere sometime
but this is a speech not a poem
i dont hear the beat
her flow go crazy
she makes more sense than shakespeare
maybe because you understand the context and ordinary language
too bad she is racist because she is too young
@z floyd cool good for her
@meggiesaurus she disallowed white people from translating her poem
shes not racist stop using words you cant understand
ami torna a scuola la longo interroga
she aint no martin luther king jr
keeps saying descendant of slaves but she is not
oh really youve collected a sample of her dna lab tested it and everything
the speech is not about her
let us leave behind a country better then the one we were left with  its been less then 2 months and you already f#%ked that up
what an oversentimental linguistically lowlevel load of rubbish cliches
@gadzi madzi pizza even
@francesco de gregorio pasta
spaghetti
 nbc shep shep 
i honestly cant believe people like this mediocre college campus coffee house crap
dr seuss wrote better poetry
 man am sure you all like/love the poem but just dislike the video because of the homework  (i hate the homework too )
lmfao this was absolute *garbage* cringe  justis isnt justice lol lol lol lol lol
@quinn t buggy im your father
like this
i love the irony of a african american making this speach about oppression for the inauguration of a man whos policies put millions in jail who is in the same party that fought to keep slaves fought against civil rights the same man who said he doesnt want his kids growing up in a racial jungle or that obama was the first articulate black man that the black community is full of super predators if you dont vote for me then you aint black and many more
and where is the rhymes if it is called poetry
@mia seligman oh really so better to wright blank verse (free verse) my dear if poet couldnt do rhymes u better open wiki to find definition of poem and then u could text something here
lmao poems dont have to rhyme my guy
her metric really sucks
i love allah
this was ineffable
cornballish 
blah blah blah
how many lies inside this embarassing speech
@rick74 politically correct is the key
explain
liberals are weird
you really wanna die on this hill after you actively supported donald trump of all people
@quinn t buggy thanks for proving my point
wtf
is famous because shes black
no
what a hollow poem a bunch a platitudes
this is propaganda biden/harris are neoliberals min wage raise rejected covid package reduced the poem is unctuous rubbish
@super fantastic top 10 in french en suite is actually ensuite
@super fantastic top 10 there is nothing to win the only thing you gained is arrogance as you werent willing to educate yourself and actually learn a little on the french language technically laisserfaire is also correct as it is the infinitive form pronounced identically derived from french and sharing the same meaning it could be spelled both ways and mean the same thing laissezfaire is the imperative form and laisserfaire is infinitive heres your cup champion  
@_bionic_frog_ laissez faire is correct in english usage as is en suite culdesac and other expressions whether or not they are used exactly like this in french your attempted correction was therefore wrong i win
@super fantastic top 10 literally was autocorrect because i had spelled it wrong once before  but as a frenchcanadian i can confirm that laissezfaire is from french origins as it means abandon let go or seize doing no need to lecture me about my language american boy
@_bionic_frog_ we use the phrase laissez faire in english im right youre wrong you also spelled literally wrong if youre going to patronise people at least do it well as a literate adult without basic spelling mistakes 
@super fantastic top 10 indeed it is a z but thats just the term because proper french would be laisser faire also i dont see how the covid package could be reduced if trump did litteraly nothing about it and just denied the pandemic
@_bionic_frog_ laissez faire look it up
@super fantastic top 10 actually its laisser faire because with a z it would be conjugated 
@rick74 you spelled laissezfaire wrong and economists no neoliberal is not a synonym for libertarian although there is some overlap learn to write something approaching a correct english sentence and then you may lecture me on what is laughable 
neoliberals is a term for laissez fair economis what you call libeterians you seem to have no understanding of the concepts of the terms you use that is laughable to an academic
she could run as president tbh
we still aint got a black james bond just saying
overhyped
this poem sucks
great googly moogly
um there is no dr biden ms biden is an english teacher dr biden dnt see pts
@rick74 well said
i know you dont have an md or seem to have an understanding of how higher education works but a master degree makes a person a doctor of science
@slims boss its the same they give to entertainers look it up im not saying she dont have a doctorate
she have a doctorate sweetheart hence doctor biden 
 marieke lucas  translate stop  not black  victor obiols  translate stop not black  dont get the job because you dont have the right skin color  thats racism isnt it 
basically america is bad and im 22 and i will fix everything
pretty much sam you nailed it lol
is so good when you acheve something not because you were the best but because of your biological characteristics
she is gorgeous and and brave    
who else hasto write an essay about her now
lmaoo are we all here cause of school i guess every teacher in the world had the same idea lol
victim victim everyones a victim im black theyre out to get me im a female theyre out to get me ahhhhhhhh runnnnnn what a way to live
do you not know what racial injustice is or
@steel pulse what
and your going to hell for eternity what a way to live
ive watched this a bunch of times over the past couple months any time i need to be uplifted my beloved aunt just died of covid thank you amanda once again for helping us endure
this is so bad its comical all these clowns in the comments section praising this trash have never read real poetry
yeah okay paul
  and now place to the lgbtq martyrs poem 
love the comments form all the trump supporters who would rather hear trump telling people to inject bleech into their veins and end with god bless the united sush
trump never told people to inject bleach that is a media lie
and in the meantime refuse to have her poem translated by white people  the irony
@airborne82 youre using internet which is notorious for being brought by occidental civ/aka whites thus i feel offended than any other person being anything else than white would even dare to answer me here see how dumb that sounds 
you misspelled activist
self righteous partisan idealogue
you gave me homework
hey to all yall pointing out the obvious bs and great acting by a race charlatan yall better be careful this is #blmusa even jake from state farm is not allowed to be white anymore 
she stole the show i remember just about nothing about the inaguration but her poem
lol you can spew anything and call it poetry nowadays as long as you play the race card
this amazing i love this this is something i will listen to it everyday
so like what make this so amazing im no poet so can someone breakdown her art
@radu bradu chill buddy
@eddy love did you even vote
@ lmaooo you a clown
@radu bradu she mentions her race in a handful of lines out of dozens and dozens of others but nice bait
lol art you mean the art of playing the race card
jut kann mir mal einer sagen welche stilistischen mittel sie verwendet  hab ne hausaufgabe hahhah
she bores me up
homegirl didnt create a poem she created a sermon
@mark mandel word
it was both poems dont have to rhyme
to bad her call for no division isnt being honored by those who put her on the stage
someone put a beat on dis 
she does know he is a racist right
why did she write a poem for a senile racist
@oyra2206 biden has said sone very racist things
senile racist no that was trump
drivel
we were forced to watch this in english class and then do some boring poetry assignment on this
look creepy joe cocoa butter and hair grease go sniff
i think nobody will outperform maya
overrated that doesnt even sound very poetic  or maybe its because im not american 
@km i watched this video because everybody was talking about it  i watched it for culture i indeed feel like i wasted my time but why are you insulting me  you seems like someone who only care about whats happening in their country thats kinda stupid since all countries are connected and what happends in one can have influence on the whole world
if youre not an american do you enjoy watching this video what a waste of time you are hahahaha well you are not worth anything
@ernesto and antiwhite thats why she was put there
shes anti american
its called a sermon not a poem
how much money did black communities get from the 90 million dollars donated to blm
90 million dollars to combat police brutality are you stupid
patheticjust a pr stunt
overrated poem is cliched pastiche written all over it
whats the fuss about her  a pretty boring delivery 
being a skinny black girl descended from slaves is meaningless in 2021 you dont get any extra points or points taken away for those things being raised by a single parent is a difficulty that is hard to overcome
why yall mad you cant get sympathy or fame by being honest need to lie be extra dramatic and definetly do whats trending and make yourself a big ol victim n if youre a real professional at this you better pull the race card why yall mad she did her job right 100%
not about scoring points simply stating facts but of course youd skew it however you like to well score points
blame the government for incentives to be a single mom
@cannibal lee right poems dont come with bios
and does it make her a good poetress writer or artist il dont think so
she goes from inauguration poet to common liar like jesse smollett in less than 60 days
this is poetry lol
no
wtf is that crap on her head
its called a headband girls and women often wear them as fashion accessories
the democrats and their fellow travelers always have the same message this countrys a failure
no this country is unfinished
soros doll
welcome world to another great poet ascending great steps
she probably didnt even write it herself
@gary sheldon jr how do you like these gas prices biden boy
@liberal voters against biden you not funny you sound stupid play that game with someone else
@gary sheldon jr nice grammar bro did you even complete 3rd grade i doubt it
how do you know was you there no you wasnt
whatever man
im sorry but this doesnt sound like poetry it just sounds like someone giving a speech now i know that not all poetry is supposed to rhyme(i did take literature and english classes) but if a politician stood at this same podium and read these same words nobody would call it poetry she would make an excellent speech writer
if you dont get it you dont get it  thats all
so many people dont understand poetry and it shows in these comments
oh the drama 
yawn ofcourse those folks always want to act like victims trump 2024
this poem should be backed by michael jacksons we are the world i come from a multi racial family of different adopted siblings my parents surrounded me with and has taught me beauty and unity comes from diversity assimilate to a rainbow everyone loves looking into the sky after a rain shower to see a rainbow rainbows arent just made of black and white its made of millions of different hues and shades the world is made of many people and cultures im not tryna sound like a hippie but it is just that we need to get it together because if we dont as a world come together as this powerful young women has said we deserve to be left in the dust i hope this gjrl moves mountains for the rest of her life because shes doing just that now inspiring raw honest and beautiful is how i would describe her speech she is what martin luther king stood for and wanted for our country and for the world you go girl 
and still no acceptable healthcare plan this nation is a failure
@soup i know saying we have no healthcare plan love juice approves of so the country is a failure is pretty dumb imao
@out of compliance that was so ignorant lmao
@schniedel mief wait let me get a magnifying glass and tweezers first
@out of compliance open my pants go to work problem solved
get a job and pay for healthcare there you go problem solved
now playing the race card
i still cry when i listen to your poem  wow
she is giving me iyanla vanzant vibes
https//youtube/htwhcstq3iu
io mai dimenticare italia politica covid 19 lockdown napoletano
come mai cnbc news caricato coesto programm io non e dimenticato covid 19 atentato 27 media io za conosco mio selulare sociale
the brighter the image
she gave me a 5 paragraph essay
biggest election fraud in history of the usatrump is the true president of the usastop the steal
saying that will probably trigger her ptsd
yea yea whatever only fraud when you lose grow up this is democracy oh wait trump and his base dont know what democracy is
mediocre at best and her poem is based in lies which makes it hollow and naive how sad id like to see her do a poem based in some objective truth
https//youtube/htwhcstq3iu
if youre so committed to equality for all people of all races then why did you fire your dutch translator because she wasnt black  thats actually the definition of racism this is the exact reason the mass majority of people in the world do not believe a single thing the msm and government agenda is pushing its all bs to divide us even more divide and conquer right news flash  we dont buy the evil racist fascist bs youre selling you can try and trick the world for a long time but that time is up #therealtimeisup
every thing she said are obvious truths that are overly dramatized and excessively articulated three quarters of that crowd probably stopped following her after twenty five seconds there are a lot of much more talented poets in the us its just that they arent a black girl
28 million views  what a wonderful poem 
its garbage
bruh i got a week of homework from her
is this a hamilton based poem lol
im shocked to see a young black woman with a victim complex
actually democracy has been defeated historically and by gods will it wont destroy americas republic 
haha looser
nice poem racist woman
from all the praise she was getting i was really expecting this to be something more this is some highschool tier trash
@andrew petro it is thanks for noticing do you think i look good
@ayden berg is that a selfie in your profile pic 
@dylan scott np mate cya later
@ayden berg oh art is subjective okay i will make sure to keep quiet about my opinions then thanks
poetry is an art form art is subjective but could you do something better that makes everyone happy
this poster black child
disgusting activism very dangerous person god save america this is version or beginning of communistic terror we know it very well from fifties
yeah because old communist regimes are known for their commitment to cultural and ethnic diversity  thats why the holodomor occurred stalin was an sjw for the human rights and dignity of the ukrainian people
i am also a poet of course im not worthy to even be compared to the great amanda gorman her poetic genius is earthshaking and beyond anything i could ever hope to write myself here is a modest little offering of my poetry i reminisced of a time long ago when i was only twenty years old i was studying english 101 at the university of british columbia in the summer of eightyfour it was at a summer session because i had failed english 101 two years before a failure due more to my citizenship in a different realm than to the failings of my intellect aptitude or the magnanimity of my core you have such a poignant and evocative writing style wrote my teacher on the short story i had submitted the week before i had written about a lonely sojourn on a desolate beach in the pregnant moment when sunset injures days abandon and grants night the freedom to roam i had written about the mighty north shore mountains hoary with age and reverberating with an energy ineffable to the mind but savored by the soul i remembered how exhausting of mind but above all of the soul writing that shortstory had been i tried to reveal my spirit bare and exposed i tried to destroy the ramparts and blow open the heavy gates shielding my secretive core but through my exhausting efforts i had only succeeded in weakening the facade between me and the world usually held at arms length but through my story then only slightly nearer yet still remote there is an essence within everyone hidden in a chamber far beneath the veneer that encrusts our core we seldom allow it expression beyond just its fractured shadows dancing on an external wall but if we all dig deep and reach into this secretive chamber we will to our astonishment discover we are all reaching into the same chamber not a separate one for each within the all and then we will grasp each others samehand we all share the same soul i knew that in the novel of my compulsion i would have to expose this chamber ramparts and heavy gates destroyed once and for all and my novel would then cry out from this collective chamber and speak for my left and for my right with one voice for all it would be the ineffable ground of being reaching out to humanity from the navel of creation proclaiming the dawn of a third age it would announce the sunset of the second age before this coming dawn a moment pregnant with change that will forever be remembered in the annals of the civilization of man it would herald a paradigm shift far greater than the renaissance not just an age of reason but of reason and divinity intertwined as an inseparable whole i envision the third age to be promoting the two primordial dancers the abstract magical and the other its complementary whole to engage in the dance and thence unshard into the eternal garden from whence we all came forth they are in eternity entwined but sharded into the realms of space and time they are shards of the divine would composing such a novel be an arduous journey exhausting my body and above all my core would i be as a drowning man gasping for breath kicking and screaming while with futility grasping for shore but would every paragraph and page exhaust me yet also leave me yearning for more it would i am sure this arduous compulsion will also uplift and invigorate me with waves of catharsis and frisson and i pray dearly for the same in my reader of soulpiercing joy if i fail to evoke the same in my audience then i would have failed to breach the ramparts and the gates shielding my innermost chamber our collective soul only within this innermost shared sanctum can i truly touch someones soul and by touching one i will be touching them all
she looks good in those chinese flag colors
the republican party looks good in the same color as the chinese flag
@olds aurora you sound immature i dont think you understand american politics at all waste of my time i doubt you even vote
@olds aurora u right u right canadas better
@madeleine maxwell yes because the america she describes dont exist i turn on news its yelling name calling and lies congressman bash each other start wars rob the american people blind
you dont actually believe amanda gorman wore a yellow jacket and red headband because she secretly/openly loves the chinese government do you have you ever heard her say anything positive (or negative) about china at all maybe just listen to what she actually said she only spoke about america and what we can achieve together
@ayden berg so you agree shes dressed in chinese colors not the red white and blue colors of america you sound dumb america aint canada
she does look good in the spanish or macedonian flag colors if we include the white then we can see poland or canadian flag colors if she was going for symbolizing the chinese flag i would have expected the coat to be red and the thing in her hair yellow so shut up
so just read that amanda gorman done a request that the translator should like to be a younger and preferably colored woman to translate her poem to danish and in the netherlands have chosen marieke lucas rijneveld to translate but a colored women janice deul criticized the election of a white person marieke lucas rijneveld chosen to withdraw so colored are racists maybe even more then white did not see that coming
key word is skinny she is happy she is not fat
this is not poetry
@nicholas tait yea sure you did buddy
@gary sheldon jr ill have you know ive memorised the whole of eliots four quartets and you cant even construct a short sentence
then you dont know poetry is
very cool good message but im also here for school
really a poem consisting of platitudes and cliches
mmmmm much theatrics very woke
 awesome bravo

@sam schoo yeah i expected thatbecause you wrote about high level of education in your countryand this is it she is product of usa low level education
@adam broz nope
@sam schoo so you probably dont live in usa
@adam broz where i live we have one of the highest education systems in the world still its very human to hold on to a card why cant you just let it go and give her credit for such a good speech
@sam schoo well i my country even little childrens can recite without reading infront of peoplediferent level of education probablybut this was not worthy of potus inauguration
@adam broz this is not just an opinion youre just straight up being rude of course she wrote it herself she a poet let the girl have her moment why do people always have to be so negative shes standing in front of a lot of people maybe she wanted to have the paper in front of her so shed feel more secure maybe she was so nervous she couldnt remember let her be

the only reason i am here is because i have english homework but other than that very powerful poem
as good as bidens speech was her speech stole the show no doubt glad biden or whoever made the decision to have a poet laureate
does she have a poem for the blm violence thst biden and the democrats looked the other way over last year
@mike cynic what that blm is a marxist organisation that doesnt care about black people
you dont get it do you
is it so important that teachers give you this speech as a homework in my opinion it is not something you guys should be annoyed of just see this speech as a chance to understand the importance of essential life values like equality and brotherhood
so we see all 7 thousand trump supporters who disliked the video which shouldnt have been disliked for just speaking facts
oh boy oh boy i sure do love the same politics i try to avoid become my homework
her clear skin is literally goals
half of the comments **praising her for being so smart** the other half of the comments *she gave me homework*
@bob your welcome cuckboy atleast were not bowing down to a demographic that kills over 56%
@bob bob is literally a middle aged white guys name
@rose hu hi dear
@dizzi 051 herab same i just wrote what ever in my essay
so true
she gave me homework tho
lol im doing it now
@bob would a middle aged white guy be concerned about homework think before you type bob
@dizzi 051 herab thanks for your comment middle aged white guy
i just listend to this 5 minute speech still dunno what she wanted to say girl if you wanna say something do it  i have to sum it up for homework i bet i can do it in 3 lines  honestly streching your 1 minute speech up to 5 doesen t make it more interseting 
what twaddle
yes she is great i think best speach of the day  loved her superbowl spot
be brave enough to see the light be brave enough to be it gave me the chills 
@eddy love i am so sorry to hear that your mom smoke crack 
oh thats just a symptom from the crack you smoked
terrible shes no poet shes a hack how embarrassing
@oyra2206 actually president trump was the only president to keep his campaign promises in decades the worst president of them all obama did nothing but lie to the american people
yeah and donald trump was not a president he was a hack as well
yeah this is a joke
being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it
basically im black and i want money for free
just is isnt always justice im sorry but thats pure cliche trash white black hispanic doesnt matter this was poor writing
kids shows
how can she stand in front of the most violent and racist party in american history who for months burned down cities and murdered people while claiming they seek harm to no one im sick of the gaslighting joe biden is a racist and his party spreads a racist poisonous ideology youve all been misled its not the right doing this i promise with all my heart and soul its the left already there are children turning their parents in to the authorities to be held accountable for dissent against the left the right isnt doing that trump never did that youve all been used you either comply with democrats or they want you suffering and dead biden administration you may trick the kids but you dont trick us who were once your henchmen shame on you democrats shame on you for what youve done shame on you for your fascist ways shame on you for using this young woman to spread your hate in a soft voice to camouflage your racist ideology you cant hide behind tokens i know what you are ive been there ive seen you we see you i will never ever comply with what you are you tricked me once before i will die before uniting with evil again
she gave me homework

there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it if only we are brave enough to be it truth gems
merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy love that line
whats up with the captions
i have so much to say about this election but i must first speak from my heart this young queen had me in tears she was so articulate so poised so captivating yet so strong today marks a day that our little girls can stand with dignity pride and hope of their future our little black girls have seen on today that they can be what ever they set their minds to be congratulations to vice president kamala harris the first woman first african american woman first asian woman to become vice president i am really overwhelmed with joy and so thankful to have witnessed this amazing inauguration welcome 46 we have a real president thank you god for keeping them safe through the inauguration of president joe biden and vice president kamala harris history has been made

subtitles be like hahshduwna heee uojjjj cee gee dat wat jaggle hum age de do
why such anger hopelessness and despair be happy you are young healthy and live in the greatest country on earth
sounds forced
pretty smile she has
why nobody notices her signs of hands the is the satanic witch
yo shut up
a wonderful reminder of the power of poetry in an age where we have a thousand ways to communicate simply standing in front of people and reciting words youve crafted is still the most potent
she trying to rap average
419
she gave me english hw and im procrastinating
thank you so much
wakanda forever
aych en bee
quiet is not always peace wow  well said
she got me thinking outside the box to help my daughter with english homework 
thanks to her i have so much work and i have no idea how to answer it thanks a lot
she is an amazing  young 
spoken ever so eloquently well said poet poetry is my passion i am a poet as well 
i am a poet too i am a 13 year old writting a poem to my mom and dad as a gift for their aniverssary and my poem is going to talk about the essensces of love and how it is important to not drown ourselves in hate while transmiting it their anniversary is in 21 days and im still defining the poem s structure and i am pretty stressed cause i have a long way but i know i can do it especially because amanda inspires me a lot (in fact my poem is inspired by the hill we climb) what poem or peice are you working on
why did you give me homework your speech was amazing tho ngl
tip click transcript and then you can just read through it
smh i wouldnt make any poems until we have some tangible assets from us building this country period damn biden and kamala til then our songs and poemsdances and all are purely entertainment til then nothing happens with this we shall overcome energy
thx for the homework
communist propaganda with king of ukraine joe biden
this is honestly one of the best speeches i have ever heard
she is way overrated any student of acting and any woman who hosts a talk show news show gives the weather or gives cnn or fox news or commentary could read a poem just as effectively any theatre actress theatre student or woman whos used to speaking to large groups can read a poem many school teachers as well dont yall think its much more than a coincidence that amanda gorman is young and pretty come on people if she were middle aged or obese or homely she would not have been selected to read a poem at the inauguration or sb and you stinking know it i also have to believe that is she were white she would not have been selected but these days young pretty and especially black  gets you lots of privilege but even if ag was white id still be saying the same thing there is just too much hullabaloo over her for godsake she read a poem with passion this is not a oneinamillion capability any adolescent involved in school plays can do this
you have a vaild point but she is standing up for the black community not just in america but across the globe and i think thats what matters
wakanda forever
she speaks eloquently just dont like her   the only reason people are talking about her is because she was chosen to be in the inauguration mad funny bro
@felix jessup fair but congrats to her she can write a piece of paper speak it and now shes famous 
@felix jessup so does literally every 8th grader for english xd
this is poetry
@corn pop the bar for art has lowered to point of a childs finger painting being revered the same as a rembrandt oh the emotion and the feelings in this lol no produce something worth praise you dont get credit for feelings
@felix jessup it sounds like someone simply talking in coherent and complete sentences apparently its considered an art form these days
good job
is anyone else getting sick off all this 
democracy took a vacation for 4 years but now its backyeah sureamanda sure
it did
love her dont trust biden
@emily baker why not trust him though
@imneofr dude him being better than trump doesnt mean that hes particularly great
whywhy shouldnt we trust bidenit was literally proven that trump worked with the russians to sway the vote in 2016 and he lost the election but somehow became president biden has literally been running for president longer than youve been alive and he hasnt won since this year if thats not an honest man i dont who is havent you noticed how quiet the news has been since biden became president every other day there was some drama with trump but with biden hes in the background actually building our country back up and passing bills that will effect the future in ways we cannot imagine the news has nothing to report on him because there isnt anything to report in the first place hes doing his job
she is a rough diamont
and biden just put as agriculture secretary to mr tom monsanto vilsack but hey you had a nice poem in the inauguration wake up gringos
want to keep scrolling to see it so i took it and im guessing he probably stole it too
she killed it 
its just comforting to know new born spirits start incarnating with the direct message/light we are the light  do not ever never forget to shine in order for all humanity shinethanks amanda
stunning
amazing 
this is a bad poem
layers upon layers of platitudes
@jim katsieris go to china
go to bed
a deliberate biased democratic political message hypocritical sounds as if the democrats are not guilty for all their division and destruction of the country over many months how could anyone listen to this speech and believe they have a monopoly on truth their actions prove they are not to be believed i see it in this address
please
she is so ahead of her time this made me cry her speech embodied all that is good noble pure truth respect dignity love 
is no one going to talk about the captions no de feed pappie koos bubel huh edit  nevermind its just dutch sorry to anyone who is dutch i didnt know
hahaha im dutchspeaking and that is some kind of phonetic translation of what she is saying but it barely means anything in dutch d
her speech and her actions say two different things
@milissa schidecker your opinions are clearly influenced by religion nothing else the reference to natural family gives it away
@jim katsieris sure
@milissa schidecker look up where i go by many female friends who identify as feminists yet in no way hate men or the natural family
@jim katsieris look it up how do you think i know
@milissa schidecker thats not true come on
@jim katsieris soon as she touts being a feminist its a wrap dont you know that feminist hate men and the natural family
do tell
she is a second rate poet just like paul lawrence dunbar she is a man hating feminist and a racist
i can do better much better its not that i dont appreciate her performance but i want to put it out there that its just the matter of being at the right place at the right time
humble huh
her hand movements made me happy
you guys should check out the guy who was mistaken for a suicide bomber on this day right outside the building just because he was wearing a cloth here is the link https//youtube/24fk6ukgwqo
love her yellow and red  what a beautiful inspirational speech
thanks for being a fan this is not an official channel  it is a private channel where i get to connect with my favorite fans religiously and privately i wont be able to reply every comments on my official channel but i would reply every comments without interruption on here once again thanks for being a fan and god bless you
hello heather
i have an homework assignment on this and its late 
i was being sarcastic but honestly if you just write about left wing ideals youll get huge marks
@legendlength can someone tell me what this poem is telling us in general cuz i need help lol
just talk about how great biden and democrats are youll get 100% mark each time
 wow that was wonderful such wise words 
lol if only the dems believed as she does ive been yelled over by more liberals than i can count in the past year and ive never ever voted republican i have made the grave error amidst my peers of asking questions and have been cancelled for it the hypocrisy of those who consider themselves openminded is something i will not forget
i mean im sorry about it but its not reflective of everyone whos more affiliated with the left
your personal experiences dont reflect every liberal
trump cloned himself 7000 times and disliked the video
this has nothing to do with trump its not true poetry and it sucks
yeah no it is just bad and pure ideology
xd
amazing 
normal people shes a great poet  legends she gave me a homework  
*godlegends biden was an awful president who was installed not elected he was installed by the ccps voter fraud*
this is so powerful and inspirational
black queen magic no other race can be like this we are magic
black supremacist
grace eloquence and inspiration  at 22
the alliteration the assonance the wordplay  just isjustice this young lady is so inspiring to so many i hope she handles her instant adoration well
imho she doesnt pause enough in order to maintain rhymes and rhythm sometimes she just keeps talking after a sentence is over without stopping or lowering her voice thus as a non native speaker i find it quite hard to understand when sentences start and end though i consider my english to be decent also idk if thats how most poetry is said/read in english but it sounded like american rap to me (mainly eminem) it is interesting because it really is different from how french poetry is read i think it might be linked to the fact that all syllabes are pronounced at the same pace and that the pitch of the voice doesnt fluctuate nearly as much in french therefore she reads it with a rhythm that is weird to my untrained ear in order to emphasize what sounds similar/matches in sentences that follow one another rather than stopping when people would usually stop ofc there is no judgement there as i dont know anything about it just some thoughts and observations from a naive foreigners pov though i can tell she must be good by browsing through the comments ^_^
she has a speech impediment so has to deliver the words with a certain cadence to avoid stuttering
this poem will be in the history books mark my words
terrible terrible poem
yes it will
ive already forgotten about greta thunberg
if you have a problem figuring out whether youre going to vote for me or donald trump then you aint black president joe biden
go back to your own country you cheaters

future english literature students get ready to study this
mashallah
beautiful young woman i love what amanda gorman had to say through her beautiful poetry  may god bless you may god bless this world we all must live in 
so what the big deal
division is what the left wants racism is prevalent but by the other race not white blm is trying to punish whites for a crime they did not commit it was committed by others from the past  this new administration is the most racist against white people  you want peace let the past go
if you dont like the idea of unity and everything she said youre not a true patriotic american see to be patriotic one must remove himself and realize that we are all in this and the main goal for many is peace equality and the same life anyone would want for themselves why people truly believes others dont deserve the things they feel entitled too when its the hands of those same people who helped them have it is insane
a powerful speech to a powerful young woman of color good for her language truly holds a power worldly power will never understand
overrated garbage shes just using her voice tone and sentence pauses and all the sudden shes the it girl lol
she has a speech impediment you ableist
this gives me hope
she gave me english homework and its due today (
@arielle legrand how is that being a hater

it is enough that the people know there was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything ~ joseph stalin
very nicebut feels more like a speech than a poem
whos also here because their english teacher sent them
me
a very special person you areamanda gorman incredible speech performed so beautifully
who else thought of anne with an e
amazing   a whole poem about hope upliftment the strength of black ppl too bad she never once specifically mentions the white supremacist ideology that has fueled the amerikkkan imperialism nightmare from its inception poets are supposed to channel the whole truth not half step acquiesce in the face of persistent evil
ur part of the problem seek some help
as a swede i have to study more english but i get tears in my eyes and i get very angry when i see that 7273 have disliked this (20210131) how can they
as an european i think that amerika has never been in more mistrust of each other than now a split nation but i know i have not the right to have any opinions someone of you has told me so
@jimmy george ok i shall be quiet but we in europe are also following this with great interest
@staffan olofsson you are in europe not here so you really dont have much to go on right we see it here clearly half the nation is not confident at all and its our nation
@jimmy george sorry i just wanted to tell that we in europe are content that mr biden won this election and terrified that almost half of the american people mistrust the result what a world are we living in
not everyone just walks in lockstep and praises someone because they are a certain color as most here are doing
it is all a lie
so what the big deal
this sucks
i hate poets
@peanut just letting you know so you are in no doubt
didnt ask

funny she has more negative thumbs then positive she is pointless and will remain pointless sad skinny black girl i bet we trace her heritage back she is a rich black girl just saying words
she has more negative thumbs than positive can you read numbers or 75k compared to 77k 75000 likes compared to about 7000 dislikes are you okay and youre mad that a black girl is successful get used to it lea
@staffan olofsson exactly im watching this as a spaniard and it baffles my mind they think trump can still win
sorry you are wrong 62000 positive 7000 negative (20210131) and sorry there is so many dumb people in usa just a thought from europe
she will be forever forgotten in history
shell be remembered for decades
the amount of dislikes sad hateful world but beautiful words
she might be the next president
this young lady may be a future president
the hill we climb when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it i stole this but i didnt want to keep scrolling to see it so i took it and im guessing he probably stole it too
@steve s they are still recounting in some states now and biden is still winning
what a fantastic poem and young lady we climb hills every day during our lives some easy many steep and difficult but its how we treat others as we climb these hills that count
@zed dravot woah dont come for lady gaga like that broski 
@steve s exactly i dont like trump anymore than biden but there are real problems with the integrity of our electoral system democrats went for years believing the baseless delusion than russia interfered with our elections to help trump that was proven to all be false and any trolling was inconsequential compared to the massive influence of corporate dark money the hundreds of millions from blm donations that went into dnc coffers and far more influential countries like china and israel there was a great amount of false propaganda used against bernie sanders trump and now any politician who tries to build a populist (noncorporatist) movement
@n g you dont know what the word baseless means or you are lying election fraud is a major issue in this country its how bush/cheney won twice its also likely how biden/harris won
if one has ever read and loved good poetry in their life its impossible not to be cynical about this garbage we also live in an age where lady gaga is considered a special original artist no surprise the politically propagandized would fall for this hogwash
@n g our claims arent baseless we have questions we got no answers why did they illegally change the voting laws in pa no answer why did they not allow poll watchers near the ballots no answer why did they put poster board on the windows in michigan no answer how did a pipe burst in ga no answer how is there 100s if not 1000s of people that voted from addresses that dont exist no answer see our claims arent baseless we were simply told to just move on without a single answer if your guy lost and these all happened against you youd want answers too
thanks oikawa
@n g i dont think so bc it speaks about a force that would destroy this country if it meant delaying democracy as if denying the constitutional rights of ppl is somehow necessary or justifiable
@n g good to know dominion falls under baseless according to your logic
@r she is probable referring to trump and trump followers baseless claims of election fraud
r your guess is as good as mine
what does she mean by delaying democracy
thank u sm
@souufflee hehe ok
thank you oikawa
that was beautiful
can someone help and tell me what the general message of the poem is iam from germany and the women speaks too fast
damn what a perfect example of a human being i hope the aliens saw this one haha
@alyah marie not really tryna be funny meant that seriously
so funny 
i am sorry to see so many dislikes and wonder why anyone would come to this conclusion  it does not matter wether this is technically a good poem or not  wether this speach was held at bidens innauguration or not  this is one of the best speaches i have ever heard and it will no matter how many dislike she gets here  go down in history  you only need to be brave enough to see it 
it was intended to inspire and unite americans  weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated thats when she was referring to donald trump
with young people like this america has a future
7k dislikes really
stolen election we will not yield
such an annoying way of speaking very weird
she has a speech impediment
this is incredible
she is so graceful in words gestures and presence
wats up with the many dislikeswat didnt you like about her wonderful deliverance
350 is that karl from mrbeast on the left side
thats my homework on this ( a describe gormans view of the past and recent past (mark the passages) b explain which passages resonate with you (that speak to you or touch you) and why (mark the passages) c study gormans poem to find examples of stylistic devices and other rhetorical strategies explain their function within the context of the poem
and for b
can you please tell me what you have for c i have to hand it in in 4 hours
and why is that special if it wouldve been a white boy nobody would care gahahahahahah
the fact that your fifth grade reading level doesnt allow you to see past the color of her skin and find something significant in her words is a shame youd feel embarrassed if you werent so ignorant
how many other qualified poets who wrote amazing poems lost out because this girl is black she had to black political bs
famous legend not bad for only 22 years old i like what she wore but mostly what she spoke beauty came out of her mouth she should be speaking at every stateand get paid for it

american decay with chocos in white people clothes you digging your grave by own hands cmon spread yor ugly and morbid democracy inside of the country the wider lay the thinner is too many freaks you was freed from their leashes

lmao brainwashing from age 8
brainwashing 101

this is why you cant have nice things america because meghan markle obama keep pulling stupid stunts like this
doctor biden shes not a doctor
@borg colective a doctorate degree is the highest level of academic degree in most fields  for research or university teaching the degree is usually a phd while applied professional doctorates include the doctor of medicine (md) the doctor of education (edd) and the juris doctor (jd) among others
@kelly hno i have a doctorate in software engineering that doesnt mean i gonna call myself doctor
quote dr biden has been an educator for more than three decades prior to moving to washington dc she taught english at a community college in delaware at a public high school and at a psychiatric hospital for adolescents dr biden earned her doctorate in education from the university of delaware in january of 2007 her dissertation focused on maximizing student retention in community colleges she also has two masters degrees  both of which she earned while working and raising a family
australia does not have nuclear weapons the uk and france do both of which have significant territories in the pacific when push comes to shove australia will severe its ties with america america will be devoured and america wont stop pushing both the republicans the democrats they are blowing up cities like beirut another country with strong ties to france germany they are running their torture flights with blackwater even bombing their own military bases in iran not to mention all the planes they have shot down with missiles or the dictators they employ for their torture programs america has fast become a global problem they are arrogant enough to continue making themselves a problem especially with meghan markle running their fkn country
in other words maga
in other words stf
ill never get poetry its such a lame craft
your spoon fed mind is ready for its next scoop of irrationality
youre just hearing someone not very good at actual poetry (i studied it)  but who is very good at making political topics sound searing like obama did speeches like these rely entirely on rhyming cadence  evangelical style the left thinks they are atheist but all they do is create new religious rituals
i think poetry only works if you *get* the poem like i hate poetry and also think its kinda lame but then one day i found a poem that really struck a chord with me and it became the doctrine of how i want to live my life its just that one poem that i really click with tho like i still cant appreciate or be passionate about any other so i guess you just havent found any poems yet that resonate with you
thats a good speach
is she quoting hamilton  the musical
yes she is she said that she had a speech impediment where she couldnt say the letter r and memorising the song arron burr sir helped her to overcome it
i now have english work on this 
same here
beautiful 
the best inauguration poem so far
she gave me english work but i dont care this is an amazing speech
damn nice barzz bro
many are called and few are chosen the first shall be last and the last shall be first
casting lots a an object used in making a determination or choice at random casting lots to see who will go first b the use of objects in making a determination or choice at random chosen by lot c the determination or choice so made the lot fell on the widows only son
@rnb x destinys trinity well after biden obama markle oprah fired their latest shots at the crown the discussion about war on america has shifted from if it happens to when it happens the word of god tonight is all about gather around and haggle meaning the nations are to start casting lots on who is going to hit them in the head who is going to kick them in the balls who is going to cut their head off its no longer about preparing american communities to stand in the war that comes as pockets of safety but to build a pathway for american refugees to escape the war they started
@rnb x destinys trinity america has taken its old civil war with the crown and turned it into a world war both republicans democrats meghan should never have become a duchess harry should never have followed her to america to launch his attacks on the crown the rest is future history
@rnb x destinys trinity it doesnt matter who is president the damage trump meghan markle have done with oprah obama cannot be contained america launched a world war on their allies both the republicans and democratics did it and the democrats have continued the fued as exemplified with this oprah girl they used at the first ceremony of their new president american intentions are clear the world gets the message you have sent both the republicans and the democrats bombed beirut both the republicans and democratics run blackwater torture flights for the cia so stop ya fkn dreaming american wake up to what your country has become
waste of time for those who wish biden wasnt president and would much rather have president orange
i told ya a biden election was a waste of everyones fkn time
dogs of war and men of hate with no cause we dont discriminate discovery is to be disowned our currency is flesh and bone hell opened up and put on sale gather round and haggle for hard cash we will lie and deceive even our masters dont know the web we weave gather around this place and haggle cast lots
let slip the dogs of war a prophetic warning playing out no one is willing to back down
this is what happens when you empower dangerous people biden you should have learned from trumps mistakes with markle oprah the raaf when they blew up beirut meghan oprah have pulled another stupid stunt that has put america in the hot pot keep going the us isnt strong enough without its allies who you continue to fkn attack
trump markle blackwater the raaf started ww3 america remains committed to the path they laid out end of story
and the only way left to deal with markle erik prince and assad is to deal with america because you just wont fkn back down ever
and america is going to continue attacking its own allies because they are too arrogant to back down from what they have fkn started with trump erik prince the raaf meghan markle
i hope the us is sanctioned so fkn hard over their cia torture flights beirut blast crimes against humanity that no one from the usa can sell anything outside us borders
@charming nowhere to hide you want to sell music under sanctions you will have to leave america exactly as the prophet marcus garvey told you
she gave me music homework
but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust
mother theresa
that was a rookie mistake biden meghan markle threatened the queen with a tell all interview with oprah you put this oprah girl up on your ceremonial stage now a blacklisted documentary was leaked on youtube as a result of this stupid stunt
even trump wouldnt pay for meghan markles security in that area he has already beaten you after you put up an oprahmarkle girl for your ceremony
dont forget the us ally australias role with the raaf megxit markle threatening the queen either
the us has gone after europe with brexit put the uk at risk of sanctions over cia torture flights now your exiled megxit duchess has launched a war in your name against the queen and you put up an oprah girl to read a poem at your ceremony the us is already at risk of sanctions that risk just went through the roof
the best advice you can ever get is to have nothing to do with oprah meghan markle
loved it
i wonder how her hair smells maybe joe knows 
because she is black was chosen to recite her poem biases is here
@austin henry aww nice mexico is wonderful stay safe too and god bless

@austin henry amen
when you listen to someone so talented  you shouldnt be able to see colour sorry

heres a poem for you roses are red violets are blue what about obama telling familys in flint michigan their kids will be ok heres another the sky is blue money is green i lost my house pension and retirement but corporate america got bailed out you are no poet you are no lorca or sexton you just signed a deal with a modeling agency keep buying the lies and trickery america at its finest
you are no poet shes better one than you she has empowering sentences when you use yours to diss also your poem is unstructured and have no grammar or punctuation at all you are no poet
notice the racist who gave a down thumbs  united states  will be all americans

just a bad poem if even a poem its more just repetative statements
its an amazing poem that speaks of the problems of recent times repetition is key to a poem and she constructed a touching one whether you liked it or not stay pressed
miss gorman yes what a stunning woman what a performance those words big bold brave handed to the world by this confident talented woman is a hope of a better world in itself i say bravo and applaud you miss gorman you are going to be great wrong you are great and you will be remembered
amil ist schlecht in fifa
she isnt a dr
its so good i got homework now
this isnt particularly good neither in rhyme meter or vocabulary she doesnt leave any pauses either how can anyone focus on the contents
@rnb x destinys trinity i see you must be a liberal therefore no one is allowed to express a contradictory opinion nowadays and to bolster your own viewpoint you put forward the obamas much mirth honestly you rate the oh bummers far too highly you do know that virtually all of obamas public speeches were penned for him dont you my word if you are rating them and their intelligence then no wonder you rated that poem so highly i watched a documentary on that girl that teenager (19) and let me tell she is quite something special however the poem for the inauguration was not all that in my opinion i speak as a poet by the way
@athos74or3m hmm i see im no poet but why be so critical and strict shes only a teenage girl and you may not see how great of a poem that was but the obama did and they have one of the best education in the world so if they said it was a great poem imma take their word for it since they are more smart and experienced than you but however you see this poem is how you see it
@rnb x destinys trinity you clearly are not a poet it was relatively simplistic language nothing outstanding at all and the pauses if you can call them that were by no means enough nice sentiments and phrasing though
the vocabulary was incredible and advanced she wanted everyone to understand not a bunch of smart old people she wanted everyone to understand and she had so many pauses yet you cant listen
she was most likely timed and she was most likely super nervous and it was a free verse poem so there wasnt meant to be any rhyme this isnt me saying anything referring to the political subject but the literary work itself
i just feel like i am listening to a rap song no offense what she said is certainly great but my ears are bouncing
its poetry
she should have recited the lords prayer because thats what this country needs as its headed down a dark path if it doesnt change its evil ways
when i was a kid in communist czechoslovakia this kind of rubbish was called engaged poetry and top commie comrades loved having it at their big events soon the time comes when youll be getting police visits because someone reported you for not clapping enthusiastically enough to this good going murica youre pretty clueless about whats happening to your country
@peanut youre getting there and people like you are not going to notice until its too late )
except that the us is not like that and this is just a speech
i really dont get the fascinationits a black teenager reading
@charis kampanje its a simple reading please stop making brilliance out of nothing
@rnb x destinys trinity i agree with you if it was a white girlno big deal for her youd think they discovered william shakespeare
so and if a white girl did it no one would have said what you said no one would even have a problem stop hating 
she wrote it too show us your work
100 times more vocabularies than trumps longest speech bigly
@destined2winamanda lays out more of a plan for america than trump ever did whining about the whole world is against him like you oh i get it now losers gonna lose
at least trump doesnt bore me 
there is hope for the world

racist trump supporter screams from this comment
and the more i thing about your comment the madder i get first of all stay in your lane we have never heard of you little girl you should be glad miss obama even hug you dont nobody want the virus them mask are a hundred percent guarantee no she dont want her husband catching a virus barack was hugging everybody he was overdoing it so dont make it sound like you was somebody special young lady you need to slow it down until you get a real big platform of your ownto call out michelle obama girl by
oh shutup shes more than you ever will be your acting like you are somebody when shes the one speaking on the presidents inauguration shes successful already who are you michelle obama knows her for hard work thats why she dont know you girl bye
this female poet is a joke
i had to come over and make a comment after watching the show the dish they brought up that this young lady said something about miss obama being jealous of her husband hugging her number one girl by you bout to mess up already talkin too much dont know one care about that her husband touching you number one she didnt want him hugging everybody because of the virus didnt have nothing to do with you miss brokeness so dont get it twisted and dont be trying to make michelle obama look like a black jealous woman i cant believe they gave you a play in the first thing you do in the interview is talk about miss obama matter fact i dont even want to hear you talk no more i dont even like poetry no way be gone 
be gone hater you dont like poetry dont listen michelle obama lives this young lady and if you are trying to speak on michelles behalf she would be disappointed with you
the lecture doesnt impress me very much
didnt ask
what beautiful prose and poetry america were rooting for you
was a beautiful poet for a young woman of her age but this inherent tickling in her voice makes me to anxious and its just one of those young prodigy type performances that didnt actually make an impact cause its all pathos and feel and hitting the vibe of what a youngster thinks an inauguration poem should be like
very little rhymedpretty bad poem actually (
@franz fuchsschwanz poems dont have to rhyme
@mshroomii hmmm wellstill doesnt make it rhyme
its a free verse poem poems dont have to rhyme or have a set pattern or rhythm in fact one of the earliest poets walt whitman wrote in a similar fashion to amanda and he is considered one of the greatest modern poets of our time

@anjafasting _rainswallows_sso why is she the reason
nice to know someone loves her because i do not i ha///the her since she is the reason my dad is dead
is she a poet or a narcissist referring to herself as she
this gave me chills  had to watch it again
i have english homework because of this
speech impediment more like smart impediment because shes stupid
much ado about nothing  a typical black high school senior level piece  with no reference to the greatness of this country  but constant declarations of coming out of the darkness  what  exactly  rule of law  securing our own borders  job creation  keeping us out of useless  heart rending foreign wars  but this amorphous whining is what passes for intelligence and sensitivity in black america  and rather than empower through economic prosperity  pandering is what the biden asphyxiation will continue to be all about 
am so honored to be able to hear this thank you sister for your elegance and those precious words
we put together i think the most extensive inclusive voter fraud organisation in the history of american politics joe biden
the only time i appreciate boring uncreative quotations from the video in the comment section is when my english teacher gives us homework that requires us using the quotation from this poem /
disturbing and very satanic
wtf how is it satanic enlighten me
hows it satanic because shes black girl bye
she was on point only there on point
national treasure
biden is hardcore racist all his career was one crime bill after another to put more black in prisons democrats never change they always was and are party of kkk confederates and slave owners
all the thing you listed last are things extremist republicans believe nice try buddy

when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade 5 weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice 10 and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken 15 but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president 20 only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect 25 we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us 30 we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another 35 we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried 40 that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
t
we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one 95 we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south 100 we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful 105 when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it 110 if only were brave enough to be it
and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade 50 the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it 55 weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed 60 it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us 65 this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power 70 to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert 75 how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold 80 fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation 85 our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy 90 and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest
everyone wow what a high iq how did she do this omg me thinking this could be told by a toddler with a little imagination
r/iamverysmart
shes indeed beautiful her voice personality and her whole self

@alexander schramm well probably the guy is right
the contrast could not be greater  between this young intelligent and extremely gifted lady who just wrote a poem for the history books  and your comments 
our country is doomed when the garbage spewing out of her mouth inspires the woke culture
dr biden what a joke
fake fraud treasonist biden hes not the prez
uncle joe would have wished her to be younger
i heard of people who cried after listening to this poem it is a powerful poem but the only reason that i did not cry is because i never really cry lol
what a pretenious cliche and empty speech suits biden indeed
this girl as an old person i celebrate a young persons need to not only be understood as a philosophical young person but also her recognition of lives and generations before her in a poem/speech/big deal moment she cant exactly understand all the decades before and after her but she helps us to at least *look* at *it* a gift i hope she goes away to another country and hunkers down for a while
just came across this she is cute but i dont think abyone watched harris/obama inaguration
if you dislike your either a republican or a 
trueee
faxx
the natural liquor preferentially snow because teller locally reflect regarding a bitter attention kindhearted automatic weeder
i dont see anything special about this  the world loves to make things more special than they are now days good for her but i just see a girl speaking as any other girl saying a speech her hand gestures are actually annoying
@gojisama just like that bernie sanders meme that everyone was posting everywhere and i didnt find funny or understand why everyone was posting it as if it was the funniest thing on earth i dont get that either and i also asked why and no one could give me a good reason for it eithermaybe i just dont find most things to be funny like the majority of peoplewho knows
@gojisama she might have to you and alot of people and thats fine i just thought it was ok nothing great but thats just my opinion and thats no knock on her as a person just my observation good for her im just an honest guy and dont mean to hurt anyone when i see something i dont understand i always ask why maybe its a bad thing because people can take it the wrong way but its never to be malicious to anyone
@themusikryder i get what you mean and i can see your comment was from a place of observation but i dunno i feel like amanda did really great in her speech
@gojisama i wish i could make a living out of criticizing people for a living without living home  unfortunately thats not the case
@gojisama im being honest not a keyboard warrior if you were infront of me i would say it to your face this is the internet and its my only way of communicating my opinion that doesnt make me a keyboard warrior if im being honest in my opinion every news outlet made it seem like this girls speech was special and i dont understand how its my opinion and i voted for biden and cant stand trump good for her but in my opinion i just didnt understand why everyone was making a big deal is that ok can i have my own opinion without being labeled a keyboard warrior im not talking bad about her personally i just didnt understand why the speech was so special
no one said this was special youre a keyboard warrior that sits around all day doing nothing criticizing people for a living the fact is the entire video is just a recording of amandas speech thats it
bless her and her gift lord and use it for her good but your glory in jesus holy name amen
blacktifulll poem
nice words amanda a great moving poem but do not let the craziness of being on the spotlight get to you keep it sane as far as running for president in 2036 that is a long way off but a nice thing to consider just do not let other people use your hopes and dreams for their own purposes
amanda the poet our future is in your hands  keep writing and loving the things that make you happy 
hilarious
that was a lame rap song
its a free verse poem in fact one of the earliest poets walt whitman wrote in a similar fashion to amanda and he is considered one of the greatest modern poets of our time
dear ms amanda gorman here is your working inquiry as promised by methe messenger that speaks what is truth god bless  and have fun under he who is the son of godnamely jc 1262021
058 she is reciting infront of the president and the nation but somehow its not good enough only actually being president is this is the disrespectful sjw cult of hate and destruction on display
too bad the folks that run this country will not heed those words its that they just do not care about us only themselves god help us all
dam dope af
prince ea female version
turn on the captions its 1000 times better
@valkyrie ziege because the poem is lousy youre being a tad harsh in my opinion what she presented was more a rhymed speech as opposed to pure poetry as that it was good i love beat poetry but lets refrain from the denouncing of everything that isnt ones vision of perfect
@sanjay thandeeswaran r/woooosh
great time at om liquidam teacup
thank you
@thomas kaiser trash is just about the point  because they are auto created then translated back and forth from english to dutch to english they turn out hilariously bad
shine a light on this because im hearing impaired and watch everything with captions or subtitles and youtube captions are trash
holy hell that is amazing xd  automated english voice recognition to text to dutch back to english makes for a great read
@sanjay thandeeswaran thats what im sayin
yo whys it in dutch bruh
brilliantly written and delivered the majority of the world could benefit hugely from the message being conveyed
we the people dont like pedophiles 
@jj remember he did lose his child so his connection with other kids is different for him
@jj thanks im gonna watch it rn
@subliminals xoxo you want proof huh well here it is watch videos   biden touching kids compilation looks like a trailer to a horror movie (the peoples ledger) creepy joe biden hair sniffing and groping little girls compilation (dailymotion) truly horrifying that people turn a blind eye to this as if this inappropriate touching/molestation of females of all ages is acceptable and ok  god help us all would you be alright xoxo with biden touching a female in your family in this way i hope not
idk who you are calling a phedofile but think before you call someone somethinf like that without actual proof got it
bravo
i want to thank you for obeying orders and installing your new communist leaders the oneworld communist takeover is now complete the new communist flags are coming soon you will be required to display it at all workplaces and communist government schools turn in your guns now or we will have to confiscate them resistance is futile you will own nothing and you will be happy
boooooooo this sucks
im here after watching jlos inauguration
can yall reply my comment what dud u understan
talent wasted at a sham inauguration/ installment one day shell realize and regret this
https//rushlimbaughjrjrblogspotcom/2021/01/bidenharrisshipwreck2021html well lets see interesting year biden wins pennsyllvanis by 25000 more votes than registered voters he wins wisconsin by 17000 more votes than voters their were two states with over 300000 combinred votes that were from people who did not exist but according to the courts all the way up to the supreme court who said it was legal needless to say i no longer trust the supreme court
all should be equal because god does not support racism division and inequality loving this keep it up and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect *we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man* and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside
amen one nation under god he is involvedhe made all of us so beautifully fearfully wonderfully 

@good life exactly  ugly hearts ugly souls ugly consciences ugly minds etc god is for love unity peace hope joy faith grace and his driven wisdom more need to read his word and grow a personal relationship with the one who actually created them to do better when it comes to serving him themselves others and be more of a positive influence within this world he created for us all  or they are just roaming around lost incomplete destructive and downright miserable and we all know how misery loves company
@wise guy again with response to your last 3 posts *1) the united state of american *one nation under god* with liberty and justice for all hmmmm seems like you should join another country *2)* are you also speaking of the person responsible for covid getting out of hand now within the us alone there are 25708124 cases with 431882 deaths what about all the other crisis in this country effecting millions of lives that started in the last 4 years you want to speak about life further no politician from either party supports infanticide or killing a baby thats been born which is illegal those that do choose this option for a myraid of reasons where are the laws and programs in place to to help resolve the surrounding issues in order to get rid of the reasons as to why some choose this option *3)* sorry to break it to you but there is nothing imaginary about god  and if you believe that you are in for a rude awakening during this life time as well as what comes aftewards
@good life ur telling me an ugly heart for not beliving in youre imaginary friend sorry mate but the invisible and the nonexisting look very much alike
@zeal0t seven looks like kelly shut him up lol god dont like ugly hearts
@wise guy preach ironic i know but i mean it )
@wise guy are you also speaking of the person responsible for covid getting out of hand now within the us alone there are 25708124 cases with 431882 deaths what about all the other crisis in this country effecting millions of lives that started in the last 4 years you want to speak about life further *no politician from either party supports infanticide or killing a baby thats been born which is illegal* those that do choose this option for a myraid of reasons where are the laws and programs in place to to help resolve the surrounding issues in order to get rid of the reasons as to why some choose this option
@wise guy the united state of american one nation *under god* with liberty and justice for all hmmmm seems like you should join another country
@kelly hno if you want to live in a country leaded by god you better go to join the taliban but sometimes its hard to tell the difference betwen taliban and fundamental christians
@kelly hno people are shooting medicals with shotguns in the name of youre god for having committed abortion
@zeal0t seven god is love which is why he the first in line that should be involved in otherwords he should be put first in our lives the living bible (his word) is the greatest teacher and guide thru this so called life of all time he created us all with unique special gifts and talents he knows each and everyone of us more than we could ever possibly completely know ourselves
@wise guy we were all made in gods own image he does not like division nor racism he intended us all to love live and work together towards prosperity and success everyone should have that shot without any road blocks this is the united states of american one nation under god with liberty and justice for all not the divided confederate states of america under no god with liberty and justice for a certain race
wow your first sentence is so wrong unless we arent talking about the same god
why does god have to be involved as compassionate and caring people we can speak for ourselves and say no to hate and injustice

@donovan zuniga complaining about homework is valid complaining about the poem itself is valid but complaining about a weird assignment like this is particularly important because it informs me about what school during the pandemic is like i _never_ had to a homework assignment about a slam poetry recital about a presidents inauguration not even in college not even when president obama got sworn in (which was a huge deal at the time believe me people cried and everything) my only question is how can it be homework i thought everyone was doing school from home already all the kids i know are going to school online where i live

martin luther king is smiling in heaven right now 0) thumbs up from canada amanda  historic poem d
the hill we climb by amanda gorman (recited at the 46th presidential inauguration) chinese translation by tb ooi  (amanda gorman 2246, ) when day comes we ask ourselves  where can we find light in this neverending shade  the loss we carry , a sea we must wade  weve braved the belly of the beast  weve learned that quiet isnt always peace  and the norms and notions of what just is  isnt always justice  and yet the dawn is ours  before we knew it  somehow we do it  somehow weve weathered and witnessed  a nation that isnt broken  but simply unfinished  we the successors of a country and a time  where a skinny black girl  descended from slaves and raised by a single mother  can dream of becoming president  only to find herself reciting for one  and yes we are far from polished , far from pristine  but that doesnt mean we are  striving to form a union that is perfect  we are striving to forge a union with purpose  to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters , and conditions of man , and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us  but what stands before us  we close the divide because we know to put our future first , we must first put our differences aside  we lay down our arms  so we can reach out our arms  to one another , , we seek harm to none and harmony for all , let the globe if nothing else say this is true , that even as we grieved we grew  that even as we hurt we hoped  that even as we tired we tried  that well forever be tied together victorious , not because we will never again know defeat  but because we will never again sow division  scripture tells us to envision  that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree  and no one shall make them afraid  if were to live up to our own time  then victory wont lie in the blade  but in all the bridges weve made  that is the promise to glade : the hill we climb  if only we dare  its because being american is more than a pride we inherit  its the past we step into  and how we repair it  weve seen a force that would shatter our nation  rather than share it  would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy  and this effort very nearly succeeded  but while democracy can be periodically delayed  it can never be permanently defeated  in this truth in this faith we trust  for while we have our eyes on the future  history has its eyes on us  this is the era of just redemption  we feared at its inception  we did not feel prepared to be the heirs  of such a terrifying hour  but within it we found the power  to author a new chapter  to offer hope and laughter to ourselves  so while once we asked  how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe ? now we assert  how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us ? we will not march back to what was  but move to what shall be  a country that is bruised but whole  benevolent but bold  fierce and free  we will not be turned around  or interrupted by intimidation  because we know our inaction and inertia  will be the inheritance of the next generation  our blunders become their burdens  but one thing is certain : if we merge mercy with might  and might with right  then love becomes our legacy  and change our childrens birthright  so let us leave behind a country  better than the one we were left with  every breath from my bronzepounded chest  we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one  we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west  we will rise from the windswept northeast  where our forefathers first realized revolution  we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states  we will rise from the sunbaked south  we will rebuild reconcile and recover , , and every known nook of our nation and  every corner called our country  our people diverse and beautiful will emerge  battered and beautiful  when day comes we step out of the shade  aflame and unafraid  the new dawn blooms as we free it  for there is always light  if only were brave enough to see it  if only were brave enough to be it  (if only democracy is replaced with theocracy and america by the world , , )
if you go to the cia website it details the armies for the world and their numbers of troops tanks etc china currently has 1000 divisions of troops thats 10 million soliders we know that in order for china to rule the world they would want the resources of the americas thus unless we use nukes nor will they their troop strength out numbers us 10 to 1 as the last time i looked we have 100 divisions so even if they send their entire army usimg conventional warfare tactics we still our still out number their armies 3 to 1 as the population of the united states is 328 million minus the ones not willing to fight the young and old children etc we still have approx 100 million citizens willing to fight back so you wonder why am i explaining all of this if the current administration bans and tries to confiscates are assult weapons what do you think the outcome will be knowing we have as of current 393 million guns registered in the us i hope i am painting a picture for whomever decides to read this lengthy post the our gun rights are so important  guns were designed first and foremost as tool of liberty which we turned into modern sporting rifles for hunting etc my point is our 2nd amendment rights which state the right to keep and bear arms against all enemies foreign and domestic is a right not a law take them away and you better start learning the chinese language my fellow americans no matter what your beliefs are no matter what your political affiliation is the firearms is an instrument of liberty and freedom id fight for each and everyone you if need be millions of us would as well we all have red blood and we need to start thinking as one nation so this great nation will not perish from the earth the firearm is the tool that will protect us all and our way of life while you bbq this weekend in your back yard with neighbors friends and family lets not forget why we get the great privilege to keep doing so are armed forces we americans are that force lets keep it that way

she is so beautiful
this is tremendous so why is there a bloody great sticker over her face saying the inauguration blah blah who is in charge i want to see her beautiful face cnbc wtf move it somewhere else
beautiful words now what do we do
those words and her eloquence can spontaneously combust trump and his racist supporters
 honestly i enjoyed this poem and performance its sad how much negativity is shown in these comments regardless of whether you like this or not i hope you guys all have a good year 
im surprised the trolls are even on a poetry video thats like literacy
@zed dravot propaganda of what
@anthony pritchard wrong i never supported trump i do however have taste in poetry that prevents me from considering this as anything but amateurish propaganda
the haters are all trump supporters theyll do anything to criticize the left even if it means making fun of someones inability
its too bad politicians cant put their differences aside for the sake of the country
@reaver red my man you look like dollar store ms beast sit down

hi it is an nice speech but you can hear a little stuttering at its deception
wow an awesome poet i ve ever come across  ) thanks amanda
my eyes hurt from rolling so much what a load of virtue signaling nonsense
i enjoyed this poetry to the bone thank you
thank you so much for this video
the cheaters are back in office i swear i will not buy or rent any videos movies or music until these corrupt people are out of the white house
he just left and went to the panhandle pandhadling
what very strange comments here shes acting its bs deep state somebody else wrote it omg can these people not believe that some people actually have talent are they so consumed with hatred cynicism no wonder america is in so much trouble such violence so much denial of reality 4000 deaths a day from coronavirus people actually killing each other in the streets such ingrained racism such denial such negativity like so many other people in the world im glad i dont live thereif some of these comments are an indication of the soul of the country the country is very unwell when its people cannot believe a truth standing in front of them and take that person on proven face value its doomed if this young woman who is a harvard graduate (she aint no dummie) and has been writing poetry for years is a fraud its time to lie down and die and yet probably lie down with the belief that a proven lying cheating bully of a businessman conman can be a great president for america  the greatest such ignorant immaturity
ikr put aside political differences and at least appreciate her poem if people wanted to complain about the outcome of the election they did not have to come to the poem video to do it here are the 3 comments above yours my eyes hurt from rolling so much what a load of virtue signaling nonsense she sounds moves and looks like an alien that just stepped out of a space ship to trick earthlings proof aliens are not little green men and why she keep wiping her nose n mouth with her hand rank  the cheaters are back in office i swear i will not buy or rent any videos movies or music until these corrupt people are out of the white house  these comments are so disrespectful ignorant salty and partially irrelevant

@victini there you have it its not meant to be theatrical yet she moves more than an inflatable armflailing tube man my criticism had nothing to do with the content but just the form i also think most people would not have paid much attention to her if the media and influencers had not gone crazy over the speech basically forcing people to love it in terms of the content i think a big part of the message is actually quite combatant and not very unifying given the current situation of the country  moreover do you not see the incredible contradiction in what you say in your comment how can you talk about unity and then assume almost half of the population is against you you are the one dividing society into teams trying to box them into airtight ideological blocks without any information fortunately society is not as simplistic as you would want it to be and i think there are more people on the side of getting over our differences rather than manically focusing on them
its not meant to be theatrical the girl is just reciting her poem of unity since you seem to be rightleaning by your rush to criticize it is befitting of you to want to tear down this girl
black washing is cancel culture
i wish i could say i share her optimism but i dont at least not in the short term
black people on the grassroots reject this crapwe dont want poemswe want tangibles#cutthecheck
lets look more closely at this harvard graduate activist poet for example heres a stanza from a poem she wrote several months ago concerning the pandemic so it is contemporaneous the poem is titled the miracle of morning and herewith the second stanza i see a dad with a stroller taking a jog across the street a bright eyed girl chases her dog a grandma on a porch fingers her rosaries she grins as her young neighbor brings her groceries are you kidding me first any qualified (and i know thats asking a lot today) english instructor might see something like this in high school freshman english and still give it a c but but even worse is that a harvard graduate uses the totally incorrect plural rosaries  and apparently no one noticed least of all amanda how many rosaries did grandma have that she was fingering the standard number is one unless she has alzheimers
@popn no problem i thank you for and accept your apology
@rmpsumma ohh tysm for explaining and sorry again
@popna rosary is a single item one cannot pray or say more than one rosary at a time or to use amandas verb form fingering which she certainly means as a synonym for saying or praying therefore correct i say (pray) the rosary you say (pray) the rosary she (as in grandma) says (prays) the rosary the only way grandmas fingering (not the greatest word choice either) her rosaries is if she has more than one on her lap and shes literally fingering them for whatever bizarre reason known only to grandma alzheimers was my comedic guess in other words it is totally and irrevocably incorrect to say or write im saying (or praying) my rosaries unless you add something like for the week or im praying ten rosaries to fulfill my prayer pledge thus definitely intending the plural form and after all this amanda is still wrong oh and of course one can own ten rosaries or buy two rosaries or whatever
@rmpsumma when i linked you to a dictionary i didnt mean to say that you were wrong and were dumber than a 5th grader i meant that rosaries was the correct plural of rosary and that i wanted to know what you meant by totally incorrect plural im sorry i totally didnt clarify enough and came off as rude but anyways what did you mean by incorrect plural
@popn when you accuse me of hate and then direct me to dictionary sites to educate me on the plural of a noun a fifth grader should know what would you call it other than acting smart if you didnt know what i meant wouldnt simply asking me have been the appropriate thing to do
@rmpsumma idk anything about rosaries thats why i asked what does the standard number is one unless she has alzheimers mean i dont know much about this subject and i never said i did so please dont make it look like i was acting smart i wasnt and i had no intention of aggravating you
@victini no name thats perfect another patronizing condescending twit making totally unfounded accusations i offer a critical observation nothing more nor less however i have a right to be angered when someone equates my legitimate criticism with hate you do exactly the same only in a more florid style i have nothing personally against this girl but the gushing praise for her work is unwarranted lets see no name thinks criticism should be proffered only to aid (as if shed accept it in any case) no name further reads whatever he wants into a comment youre fairly risible in your priggishness hows that no name lol your overwrought and uncalled for comment is noted and equally dismissed thanks for the laughs though
@rmpsumma wow an overreaction of gargantuan proportions it is fine to critique her work and point out flaws and inconsistencies but the rancor with which you approach this is unnerving this woman is clearly talented and still in need of refinement but your criticism branched from one of aid to one of animus barring all literary skill what is so unbearably incorrect that you harbor antipathy for the woman you treat the matter as if she is an incorrigible your undue hysteria is noted and dismissed
@popn unbelievable apologia yes its one verse  but im not going to go through an entire poem i dont have the time or the stamina or the inclination i picked one verse as a notable example of mediocrity yes rosaries is the damn plural of rosary yes yes yes but its incorrect as she uses it little miss harvard i even explained the reason its wrong in my comment but it didnt remotely register with you why are people who dont know what theyre talking about the first to want to make fools of themselves by attempting to counter a credible comment with utter nonsense to the leftist nutsos legitimate criticism is now hate outrageous btw you dont know much about rosaries either
thats only 1 stanza though if a high school english teacher graded that 1 stanza as a freshmans whole poem im sure he might get a c but this isnt the whole poem and i dont quite understand whats wrong with the plural of rosary rosaries is the correct plural for rosary i think https//wwwgooglecom/searchbih=625biw=1366hl=ensxsrf=alekk01hrf4ewpn2fjbaxpeigdp4jgmrww1611630615354ei=f4gpyif5fitn9aol5lcobqq=rosary pluraloq=rosary pluralgs_lcp=cgzwc3ktywiqaziccaaybggaebyqhjigcaaqfhaemgyiabaweb4ybggaebyqhjigcaaqfhaemgyiabaweb4ybggaebyqhjigcaaqfhaemgyiabaweb46bagjecc6bagaeem6bqgaeledoggiabcxaxcdatokcaaqyqmqfbchajofcc4qsqm6bwgaeledeem6agguogqiabakujuwwkxcyonkaabwaxgagagjaygb7wesaqmyljeyaqcgaqgqaqdnd3mtd2l6waebsclient=psyabved=0ahukewjh4njyz7juahwem30khqsydfuq4dudca0uact=5  and its probably not completely crazy for a grandma to finger more than 1 rosary im not a poet and i dont know much about poetry but i dont think this hate is reasonable is she really that bad
with young people like this america does have a future amen
betty baker
thats my best friend
what an amazing young woman
powerful
why is this my english assigment
@everythingscomingupmilhouse amazing im sure you have been redpilled and now understand everything funny how that is i mean to say funny how one could believe that there is an allpowerful group of individuals who control everything yet you you a person of nothing in such a system are allowed to gain so much knowledge that you learn of their existence how logical 
because youre being brainwashed
because our teachers have no will to do something interesting
more like political prose than a poem
when you order the pledge of allegiance on wish 
@mshroomii when the speaker started using political phraseology like president and democracy maybe 
@mr meerkat when did basic human respect and being better as a people become a political idea
@mshroomii it was a political speech that was erroneously presented as a poem
its a free verse poem poems dont have to rhyme or have a set pattern or rhythm in fact one of the earliest poets walt whitman wrote in a similar fashion to amanda and he is considered one of the greatest modern poets of our time
so freeverse
nailed it
hello there

bundi gundi
what does have skinny have to do with it
it just contributes to the thematic imagery it is poetry after all
in my opinion it contributes to the notion that physical strength is not what brought her here but acts of moral strength and mental acuity which makes sense since her poem touched on topics like the resilience of democracy against things like the insurrection from trump supporters and the usas perseverance through supremacy and opression
my dog had her ears up looking at it
i will hope that changes will come soon in america if the poem was done by a with girl
incredible
8k despicable denizens of the shade she articulates showed up to repudiate her message of hope to humanity and desire to build a better tomorrow
@no name its no use reasoning with people who are driven by hate and emotion instead of reason and logic trump supporters are trump supporters for a reason after all
@david i suppose given that it doesnt carry any conspiracy theories or peddle hate fuelled lies 
or maybe they dont like the poem and i understand them
what is the message behind this speech im only here for my homework
@mackeyboy amane  i thought it was a beautiful speech but this is hilarious
she was talking about how much money she has and that shed bust a cap on someones ass after shes finished talking
remix
that voice went in one ear of bidens and out the other this country is smoke and mirrors and benevolence equality and justice is a joke to the ptb these people are puppets controlled by deep state a luciferian power with an agenda that has been working to design this country to be exactly the opposite of what shes speaking
ok boomer
she doesnt only dances with words but also with her hands love this 
@master joe ker *hitler and stalin would like to show some of their speeches *
her words her delivery her gestures and her mannerisms are perfect such a great performance message and young woman
this is literally the worst speech in history
@retardo davinci what do you mean
doesnt everyone in this rank of hierarchy do that i mean look at trump or just any president before that
i cant believe 8000 people disliked this so sad
@lmozep divers political correctness is a huge part of the problem because it inhibits critical thinking example having to use the term african american when you dont know the person no one can tell merely from looking at a person that they are american or indeed from africa its a stupidity that boggles the mind 4 years wont change any of that (the depth of intellectual laziness in this country goes deep)
@andrea andrea uneducated lets see where america stands in 4 years and if all the poltical correctnes and the so divers members of bidens team will make a good job
@reaver red haha people from ccp china are in the back room arent they
@chong qing68 the deep seated antiintellectualism in america needs to be addressed americans are terrified of the mind americans need to be educated education in america is appalling
the educated can alter the number
the uneducated there are a lot of those in this country
trump supporters
she is eloquent elegance in his words it is time for america to rebuild itself and put racism aside
wow she was incredible
the new roman empire
massive voter fraud not biden fault
biden is illegal  investigate and impeach biden first why states did not follow the rules and law and court did not get involved
investigate and impeach biden first why states did not follow the rules and law and court did not get involved
powerful
this is without a doubt one of the most platitudinous dull grasping uninspiring and ineffective poems ive ever had the displeasure of hearing utter drivel complete nonsense that does not reflect the attitudes and/or realities of the general populous at large im convinced more than ever that virulent and caustic nihilism is the only way forward all hope abandoned
im a try something see what will make a reply get deleted she has a sociology degree from harvard she attended a private (that means expensive) school in la k12 she included that line about being raised by a single mother to make herself appear like she came from nothing but in all seriousness she is the epitome of privilege this is a sham )
calm down austimo its just a poem not like you can do better lmao
i needed to be energized this truly energized me and brought a new light into my life 
i have read this poem  it is stupid it has no rhyme nor reason  it holds no actual bases in history for the black people  only for white america the justice in america is not broken  it was created by biden to destroy the black family along with those before him they picked this poem because it had nothing to do with the black people in america and everything to do with continual systemic racism find the time to read it  question each line research the words and how they are used she is the product of the black school system where history was not taught nor the command of the english language  only how to worship the white people
shes not actually saying anything its rather nonsensical and totally lacking in substance you could make this stuff up on the fly just say it with that preacher inflection theres no there there
i agree very boring
too flowery imo i came back here because its only been 4 days and id already forgotten what the poem was about (which is really a bad sign for a poem although i really did enjoy listening to her recite it at the time) im not hating good cadence and effective delivery makes it pleasing to my ear but i still cant exactly figure out what shes trying to say like i can tell exactly what kiplings if is about (stoic life advice being passed down) i can tell you exactly what the hollow men is about (the cataclysmic horror of ww1 and imperialism) i can tell you exactly what a dream deferred is about (the righteous explosion of fury by freed africanamerican slaves by promises broken to them) and i cant even recite most of the words to them i guess im just not very literate can someone more literate than i please explain the message of this poem to me
@bennie washington i have plenty of problems my friend by average probably no more or less than anyone else but unfortunately i dont understand what youre trying to say of course i agree that poetry doesnt have to rhyme (i dont think it even has to be verbal or written  poetry in motion for examine) neither _the hollow men_ nor the langston hughes poem i cited nor nikkita oliver slam poetry i enjoy rhymes in a traditional sense however _good_ poetry must have content or at least a message its trying to convey this is what i call an empty poem bad poetry it lacks gravitas a coherent message or an emotional delivery which in a meta sense makes it the prefect poem for president biden
you didnt seem to have any problems poetry is not a rhyme
@cornelius johnson let me know what you think i find her as a kind of antidote for the style over substance emptiness that the young womens poem in the video shows (or i guess *doesnt show*)
@dethkon ill check her stuff out btw
@dethkon she sounds like your average mid west valedictorian graduation speech also ive gotten in the habit of questioning anybody who seems to pop up out of nowhere way too much reconciliation words for a nation that dont even acknowledge ish
@cornelius johnson you hit it this is the reason why i cant figure out what the hell shes trying to say in this poem and from a young poet laureate just mediocre if i wanted to listen to slampoetry (which ill admit i still enjoy sometimes) id listen to nikkita oliver shes my personal favorite of this type of poetry
thats because she didnt say anything tbh its full of cliches and a disneyland perspective on american race issues i dont care if someone thinks im a hater lol
, ,
a wonderful poemshes amazing
boring
she said a whole bunch of nothing
thats what im saying bro
this is what kamala referred to as fancy speech all sound bites and no real meaning
wut
love from malaysia
this girl was really good 
the dislikes are from racist probably
rolls eyes
the way she speaksthe way she moves she seems so powerful
wow she is so confident
wow this is amazing
ok
who else is doing this cause school
cut the check f**k this speech
cringe
this is nothing but symbolic subservient garbage praising two people who hate black people just as much as trump only difference between trump and biden is that bidens antiblack racism comes with a smile afterwards
now everyone wants to be irishpay me 1 euro and i will be your official irish cousin now pog mo thoine
i have to listen to it atleast once a day
repent for the kingdom of god is at hand  jesus is god jesus is coming
tell um sister 
i dont think her red hair thing i suppossed to sit so far up 

cant stop watching and listening to this i have watched it for over 50 times you nailed it you spoke to the world on that day not just americans
she stole the show and shes brilliant talented and beautiful
pandering to black voters
this was phenomenal 
what
beautiful speech by this young lady but l feel it well fall on deaf ears in bidens democratic party as they are there for elite only im afraid you gave up the leader your country needed for the people time well tell we have the same problem in canada  with our socialist leader of trudeau but not for long hopefully
brilliant
something about this reminds me of jfks speeches in words and delivery maybe this young lady will be president someday simply gifted
what an impressive young lady 
this is so beautiful 
the only good part of the inauguration
shivers
https//wwwyoutubecom/watchv=jp9pymqnbzkt=3s
amen 
being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and see how we repair it deep 
this was beautiful she did a great job and i hope the people were listening this was one of the greatest moment i saw in the new day watching our new president and vice president being sworn in this young woman should be given an award
this presentation remind me the famous one that steve jobs did while ago to the students
uhhh no this is infinitely better
as an african american i am so happy i didnt vote for biden this whole mess with the demon democrats remind me of the movie east side high president trump is the good teacher who helped the black kids achieve and do well in class and the devil democrats are the bad teachers who didnt want the blacks to learn and do well in life
the media is our enemy
she is so gracious
hello there i find it really odd replying to your comments here because i dont usually chat with fans but i want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here  i realized how much you like and follow my channel thank you
i was hypnotized speechless bravo amanda gorman america needs people like you
this poem really made me cry welcome back america we were always great and we still are 
for once you actually put some thing on there worth watching
let our light so shine before men

american kids are indoctrinated with the question who would i become instead of which problem can i/should i solve
@tran viet prevails in the west in general or places with mobility or opportunity be it canada germany wherever the indoctrination part sounded weird as human if theres a chance we ponder on what wed be that doesnt negate the possibility of what to do better but it doesnt beg the question
@mario garcia not everybody i live in different countries and cultures the kind of sentence which contains i and some title prevails in the us
 thats everybody what does this have to do with us specifically
wow here stands the future president of america who once again will make america the great donald trump said
what a bunch of crap
amanda gormans inaugural poem the hill we climb miraculously lifted america out of the shades of darkness the way to go
no biden is putting us into the miry clay
barzzzzzz
she was born for this moment 
van itt valaki akki tudna nekkemsegiteni magyara leforditani hogy mirol beszelaholgy 
chilling words
how can someone have the gall to dislike this video she has spoken the truth if you dislike this video you are blind to the truth or just a pure hater of the truth
this poem is like a light at the end of dirty tunnels of politics
the whole inauguration ceremony was a terrible experience and a great shame for the usa  it looked like the 1950s when the bolsheviks took power in eastern europe the usa is not on its way to hell the usa is already knocking on the gates of hell 
 so powerful i cried
cornpop cornpop cornpop 
god bless all creeds and colors
israel embodied within our country the bicultural existence of jewish and arab israelis peace
very untrue
i have read and listened to this so many times i truly cannot get enough of it amanda has created such a beautiful and powerful poem what a remarkable woman 
@reaver red ive noticed youve nothing better to do than spam this video with bigoted opinions i can only apologise for how terrible your life must be
everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid

shut up
i am a disabled vietnam veteran i want to thank you for your poem you touched my heart with your words and gave me hope once again that all veterans did not fight in vane to defend the constitution of this great country regardless of our countries mistakes it has the ability to adapt change and progress towards the goal of one day all people regardless of religion race and education are accepted equally without ill will there will come a day when everyone understands that the purpose of life is understand that everyone has a purpose
@chris mabry hello again russia
@merle bicknell yes something i realizedfinally about two years ago and teaching my granddaughters
@patricia foster hope is always a good thing action is a better way to hold onto what is righteous we must remind everyone everyday of wrong doings until we silence those who would be king

it is disappointing where we are now and where we are headed i see so many people are products of the environment they create and rely on ie social media reality tv and a host of propaganda outlets praying on the vulnerability of those who choose to ignore history change and the reality of the moment the best chance we have is to be ever vigilant to protect this experiment in democracy by fighting lies and deceit with truth and reason @chris render
how bout now how do you feel where this country is headed
@random kid 7 hello and thank you for your message when i was in my teens so many years ago now there was never any doubt about entering into the armed forcesits what every young man and some women did and wanted to do service and sacrifice for our country was a given for everyone really i very much appreciate your words of appreciation but i was only doing what came naturally when you love your country
thank you for your service and sacrificing your life for the protection and wellbeing of our nation may god be with you
thank you for your service you are a an inspiration
@merle bicknell thank u for your service
thank you for your service youre a hero
@chris mabry it can sometimes come to pass that those who harbor fear and hate can later embrace compassion and caring of course there is also the opposite that can occur as well it seems to be ware we are at present wouldnt you say thankfully this country has and will for ever embrace change when there is wrong doing and ill will interfering with will of all the peoples rights i can only presume you meant to point out a time in history and meant no ill will towards anyone thats correct isnt it
@merle bicknell if you voted for the democrat party you are not someone who wants accepted equality without ill will they literally were the people who fought for slavery in the first place (although the civil war was more complex than simply slavery) for example the democrat party is the only party pushing for segregationist policies like affirmative action affirmative action definition the practice or policy of favoring individuals belonging to groups known to have been discriminated against previously literally textbook racism also the democrat party is the only party who puts down white people and deliberately disadvantages them simply because they are white the democrat party should be ashamed and so should this brainwashed girl for believing that their cause is equality in fact their cause is far from that united we stand but divided we fall and the democrat party is a party of division lastly how can someone like you who served for our country even look at these people when they made fun disabled vets and denied them medical help the country you should truly be proud you served is the country that held the core values of america life liberty and unity under god not the country the democrats are trying to build or should i say destroy become informed dont wait until despotism to fix the problem they want to control us wake up
@simon wang as long as we believe it will come to pass that someone will say in the past there was great anger and terrine but no more
you touched my heart i thank you so very much 3
@nickey bordelon when i was young many years ago i read the words on the pedestal of the statue of liberty which read give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free it never occurred to me that for so many americans would be so hateful and not understand these words are meant for everyone and not a select few the very foundation of our country is based on diversity of beliefs and the ability to seek freedom justus and liberty from those who would suppress it
a very sincere thank you for your service  god bless you 
in your hands
@dethkon your words are comfort food for the soul i will follow your many success in the future and rest well knowing that americas true greatness is
your welcome
@yui tsoi your more then welcome you can rest assure that thousands of people before me and thousands more after me have and will defend the beliefs that the constitution put forth all those years ago so are never lost to time
thank you for your service
the last two lines get me every time
sitting under the shade it means there is lightopen the eyes
what a load of tripe
i love you little sister you are powerful and brilliant a light for the world to behold stay strong grow stronger in gods name yes to you
even asshe gives us hope 
5 minutes of a perfect speech never heard that from trump im glad that we are heading into a better future
this women really talented with expression i loved it and the poem which she made mind blowing
the amount of mindless drones in the comments lol truly brainwashed sheep
why is she dressed like a cheeseburger
our blenders become their burden how perfect a perception and such a subtle take down to those people who refuse to be part of our society
@david canning i checked out the posted written versions
@patchessleeping sorry i am a foreigner it was how i heard it
our blunders become their burdens what we do wrong our children inherit
im a black 
the world waits
chilllllssssss
ive watched this probably 10 times nowlolwhat a wonderous young woman
a or the bright spot in the inauguration
she hit different
i would have loved this even more if bernie had won
stupid so what
soo much bs
peace
dislikes huh
indeed and very truly indeed quiet isnt always peace
@v k oh you mean blm and antifa cuz i was at the capital and i identified several people who were caught looting and rioting and identified as blm and antifa sooo not sure where you were going with that anyone who has military surrounding a building with a wall to keep all the plebs away and paying media news outlets and fact checkers to say there was no voter fraud  that would be disinformation as hundreds of people have come forward and said there was voter fraud i want to remind you of one thing if trump supporters or republicans or conservatives wanted to take over the capital they would have brought their guns and they would still be occupying the capital but this was a liberal blm and antifa riot that just wanted to give the media and democrats a reason to enforce communism on the american people by now painting all republicans or conservatives as a political party to oppress just like the chinese communist party put everyone of the opposing party in jail or killed or a reeducation camp which has been suggested by pelosi and to drone strike conservatives in their homes for opposing dictator creepy uncle joe and his insane policies according to a media reporter who works for cnn now who oppresses people for their political beliefs a dictator who controls the media a dictator who killed the president of tanzania he went missing for 10 days and then their media said oh uh he had a heart attack because he wouldnt play the game of covid19 being a pandemic now the american media is painting the tanzania president as a dictator but he wasnt he just took the covid 19 tests and tested pawpaw fruit mango a sheep and a goat and they all came back positive for covid 19 he told the media to spread the news that the tests from china were defective to provide a narrative that everyone has covid but you go ahead just let me know what biden has done that wasnt a communist act 
thankfully the dictatorship that tried to take the capitol with their terrorist friends failed and now we get to listen to the failures that scurried to the shadows like cocroaches complain on youtube instead from inside the white house
@kt rainbow the elections werent fraudulent there was no evidence of any such thing happening youre building this idea of biden being a dictator from evidence that doesnt exist simply opinions or prejudice whilst i dont think there can be a perfect leader for america i think that there can always be a better one and how has biden taken over the country with military force genuinely curious
@zainab i dictator tells you what you can and cannot do or you will be punished a dictator takes over a country with military force (read the times magazine article on how the election was fraudulent and we should be thankful for it) and military and fences will continue until may for the capital here are 2 mixed race twins to let you know their thoughts on dictator biden https//mfacebookcom/storyphpstory_fbid=3872369726177460id=153657598048710
@kt rainbow do you even know what a dictator is
rightis that why dictator creepy uncle joe hasnt spoken to blm
america is just racist and will always be when will african americans wake up and
sucks lol
amanda gorman has well expressed how united we stand divided we fall
historic speech
fun fact you searched this up (btw great work were all proud of u and i cant even imagine what your mother feels rn in the future i bet youll be as big larry king)
nation unfinished  ha ha joe finish it now
being honest l am german and saw her in the german tv and i was deeply impressed this is america and l am sure she will make her way great
@karen washer grudzien i dont know in what context you had to get rid of this sentence but if it helps you  and please dont forget to support your nation splitter
my father killed many nazis in ww2 probably some of your ancestors too

i mean wow just wow
beautiful
great
such odd coverage of this entire thing other than the same shots/angle of bidens group behind podium all audience look like paid actors no zooming in on anyone in that crowd much huh funny cause when you really look at snapshots of this it literally looks like a stage where they added trees and little blobs of color to look like people
us americans like this kind of speach the rest of the world considers it as overdrawn and ridiculous both republicans and democrats think the us are the centre of the world but hell youre not a nation that isnt broken weeellll  not so sure
i love this so much i literally translated the whole poem into my first language (french) its on my channel ^_^
could you copy it for me i would love to read it in french im a french teacher and it would be wonderfully uplifting and educational to introduce my french students to this poem merci beaucoup 
love everything about it the cadence the alliteration the beautiful dance with words the message the delivery spellbinding
lol at all the pretentious virtue signalers liking this condescending drivel 
what a joke skinny black girls dreaming of presidency let kamala tell you how it really works let kamala tell you how to get to the top its not what you know its who you know
what absolute trash
how does this effect you in anyways
beautiful
we have braved the belly of the beast
a low class dig at trump but lets shower her with compliments acolades big titles big job positions and a modeling contract
wait what minute was that in
im just wondering why this post got the dislikes that it did this beautiful young lady spoke peace and yet dislikes that lets you know the kind of world we actually live in where peace is frowned upon and or dismissed yet the opposite is the norm
hope one day amanda youll come to canada and visit us in montreal
this looked like amandas inauguration
what sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil that dark is light and light is dark that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter  isaiah 520 repent and turn to christ we are told that the end times will be dark indeed and we are all born as sinners joe biden supports abortion and kamilla harris wants to tear down the american constitution and says its outdated (america was founded on god) jesus mentioned events of what would happen in the end times matthew 24 1jesus answered watch out that no one deceives you for many will come in my name claiming i am the messiah and will deceive many you will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen but the end is still to come nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all these are the beginning of birth pains the chapter of the bible in revelation mentions the seven seals which include terrible events to come to those who have not repented there will be something called a rapture where people will suddenly disappear from the earth and those are the christians what is left here will be events of the coming of an antichrist up until receiving the mark of the beast (satan) it condemns you straight to hell and the only other option is to die and only be a servant of god instead of inherit eternal life john 1416 jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me turn to jesus now because we are all born as sinners no man or president will be able to save you from what is to come only christ was pure and if you want to be set free from what is to come and not be condemned to hell you need to accept christ soon time is running out https//wwwbiblicalprophecyunfoldingcom

marxist dung
amazing
but antifa and blm riot loot and break windows in the name of unity  ya right
dr biden hahahah 
what in the hell does she have on her head
a democratic poet who likes to frequent italy for its history no for her culture no to frequent the milanese upper class like miuccia prada here they are the court jesters of the democratic party now only the logo remains democratic ridiculous how can they represent the american working class i thought that in italy we had incapable politicians but in the usa everything is always big
i see the trolls are out
wow 
love this recital awesome job amanda
hello felicha how are you doing
new maya lou angelou torch seems to have been passed for next gen god bless her

shes brilliant
this is amazing i love how she includes hamilton im going to learn the poem
president of the united states of voter frauds
she shone like the sun on a new day
now i see 81000000 people are brave enough to be a light
she is incredible also the live for hamilton references
@o k she literally said history has its eyes on us lol
@o k the scripture yes but i heard other similarities too
i thought the same thing for a second but hamilton was referring to the bible and so was she lol
if romney had beaten obama in 2012 i dont believe a devout teenage mormon would have given a biblical address about how theyd endured four years in the belly of the beast
blah blah blah poetry while the left says submit
well there are moments and there are moments and that was a moment youth guiding us a path gives hope that our future can be better amazing words from an amazing mind
ms amanda gorman stole president bidens inaugurationi believe he was okay with it #blackgirlmagic
blackgirlmagic yeah thats not racist at all what about white girlyellow girlred girl
she a real hustla the next al sharpton go on get these suckaz while the gettings good shawty
what a joke stolen election
biden began his phony presidency with a disturbing inauguration speech that signaled his administration will target any political opponents who reject his radical agenda this would be a continuation of obamaera practices which saw the obama irs doj fbi cia etc used to target obama opponents ranging from small citizen tea party groups to thencandidate donald trump indeed that virtually no ordinary americans were allowed to view the proceedings in person thanks to a politicized military shutdown of our nations capital doesnt augur well for this republic and our civil liberties and then biden immediately undermined the rule of law by shutting down virtually all deportations and essentially ending all enforcement of our nations immigration laws you can read the details here and of course bidens mere presence in office is a challenge to the rule of law because of his personal corruption issues there is substantial evidence from documents and witness statements that the biden family including president joe biden may have been involved in criminal activity involving among other issues foreign entities tied to ukraine and china joe bidens son hunter has already acknowledged that he is the target of an fbi criminal investigation
i have read and replied (positive cmnts) but there is a debbie downer in every crowd that is what is wrong with america today we need to lift each other up not tear down we have all suffered with covid but yet a lot of people are so negative is it really that hard to find some good in everybody i thank god for my heart and i feel sorry for the people picking her apart its disgusting esp at a time like this smh
the black girl serving the rich white man
she is 22yrs oldabsolute genius

awesome i love it amazing
poet shaddap pussi
nice do whats it made from
the hate in the comments from people arguing she just wants division while talking about peace is the height of hypocrisy
aoc wants to put white men in reeducation camps good start for unity

she made a statement
she will never get her point across without looting and rioting
making people cry when theyre wearing facemasks )
its amazing how humans of all races look so alike amanda gorman looks very east asian the only differences are the skin color and hair texture her features fit well in east asia and in africa if only we noticed how much we look alike and see this as how we are related to each other maybe there would be less racism for racism is mainly based on hating those who look different
i really love her english i wish i can also speak like her

and the award to the best english teacher goes to amanda gorman  wow her mother shd rly be proud of her

what a shame people think that this man joe biden is somehow a decent person and that hell do well if they only knew ive spent the last 2 yrs examining everything i could get my hands on about this man his history and everything to do with the politics of the day what a stinking shame that hes going undo what trump did and tell me something why does this young lady have to present herself as black person daughter of a single mother come from slaves good grief this is 2021 i come from an indentured servant of sir yeardly in the 1600s so what why cant she just introduce herself as a poet i dont care if she is black yellow or purple i feel like its such pretentiousness that those who are black now have to have a serious introduction they are just like me so when i step up there as a poet myself do i need to talk about my single mother my ethnicity no of course not is she more special because of her individuality of course not everything about this administration taking away what trump has worked for and pretending that people in ca did not detest kamala harris for her many short coming as the ag it makes me want to wretch and we are not whole we are guided by media who guard and cuddles the democrats so that they cant be found out we have those who try to mock bully and diminish us as conservatives on the right like never before it is a scary time for us and shes probably so young that she has no connection to what is really going on in this country as they call good bad and bad good and notice this there were far more cheering for trump after his goodbye speech than the hello speech that biden gave it was embarrassing that so few were there except for guards it was so embarrassing my friends who live outside of dc said as they actually wen to that innaguration thing if you knew how badly the left hates trump youd understand that a coup was formed in 2015 to keep him from winning and those same people were never going to allow him to win this time they planned out well on what to put into place and youd have to be stupid not to understand what happened of course even the republicans who have to get along with the biden administration are not going go say anything except to say they saw no proof of cheating just in the last 3 yrs in different states you can find verified cheating/fraud examples on youtube this went on on a massive scale in several waysyes it happens and in fact has been going on in pennsylvania for decades im almost 70 there isnt a lot that gets passed me these days
you tell em donna it just goes to show how low those democrats will sink to use a young idealistic politically naive woman like this to promote their socialist agenda what is more she is from a privileged background and went to a private school in santa monica that costs $34k to $42k pa
those who lived in socialism know this politic poetry very well welcome to socialism
@mark newbold comrades are always the same through the time and countries so when you know what to watch for you can see it
damn comrade who told you
that has surely more flair and meaning than ayn rand thats for sure )
wtf she is not wearing mask covid is over
she is very daring girl her speech and expression is mind blowing hats off lovely girl
i do not wish to worry for her but for some unknown reason i do  and that pains me but then again that is just my fear showing nothing to do with her 
over 7000 dislikes on this video just because of an eloquent poem from an african american im sure most of the dislikes are from white supremacists (also known as trump supporters)
prada
vain babbling
why does she have a plane neck pillow on her head why
am not only in love with the confidence its in the melody at which the words flow out of her mouth and the glow 
this girl has been given everything on a silver platter one of those privileged people in america and she still cant do anything but complain
no thanks 1 he cheated 2 liberals dont want peace or unity else they wouldnt be striving to get fired and doxx any trump supporter that was in dc that day even ones that didnt even approach the capitol building this country is screwed under democrats
djt is the president  do better youtube
he isnt stop crying
and just think  she was surrounded by very powerful men women
this will be read for years to come but will never have the same impact it has for us now because of what were living through
what was that on the head
im getting old so hurry up and run for president
yawn
dump chum are you listening  i bet you chum cant speak like this kkk 
anyone who had the audacity to put a thumb down shame on you
exactly talented angel you are definitely showing off your ancestry coming from a line of kings queens emperors chiefs and pharaohs standing out like no other keep it up
@a biss oh dear the irony all you morons do is project project project control your blaaak victim complex its pathetic
@a biss they prolly do
@stacey gram you guys wanna be the victim so bad stacey
@stacey gram oh really then go support woke supremacists and be quite lol what a joke that is that is no comparision to centuries of heinous crimes white supremicists have done get a clue
@jonathan alvarez oh really then go support woke supremacists and be quite lol what a joke that is that is no comparision to centuries of heinous crimes white supremicists have done get a clue
@yash200 wzee black supremacy is only a positive in the eyes of black supremacists sorry for ruining your fun racists * shrug *
@stacey gram still delusional are we you came into a postive thread making a negative hateful remark
@yash200 wzee when/how have i been hateful oh right youre still just projecting
@stacey gram still hating
@yash200 wzee still projecting
@**** it is a market that he targeted while campaigning the bad people or the naive people however you would think that the naive ones would know better to side with the bad ones or maybe they are just as bad in heart themselves we got a good look at all of them on the videos that continue to surface from jan 6th
@stacey gram hate hate hate those who look differentits all people like you do i would be embarrased too to admit i support him
@**** project project project its all leftists ever do
you cant tell a trump supporter nothing remember they hate people who dislike trump more than they actually care about trump like a cult where they dont care if he is wrong they will continue to turn a blind eye and ear even if he is so blatantly against god and his word so unless 1) you have a deep hatred for people of color  2) a greedy wealthy person with no ethics morals on real values 3) not educated on what trumps history of what he has said and done or 4) not playing with a full deck of cards upstairs to follow someone that is clearly mentally unfit for this job there is no godgiven reason to vote for him his own family knows him and warns us not to mention tons of respected witnesses as well as video and audio tapes to prove it biden/harris has better character to lead our country back to where it should be and do better
@yash200 wzee nope not a big fan of trump still living in the sheepfold are we
@stacey gram poor thing heading to maralago are we
@yash200 wzee keep projecting brainwashed sheep literally every single thing that comes out of your mouth is the exact opposite of reality
@stacey gram clearly you are in denial history is the evidence duhhhh also you sound like the typical clueless ignorant stuff that hate groups want to spread as they support t r u m p  which would include white supremacists neo nazis q devil worshipers and others designated by southern poverty law are you really that upset that they could not stop congress and what the constitution required on jan 6 or because they were unable to storm the capitol yet again on this most memorial inauguration in us history
@yash200 wzee no but youre clearly projecting also you wouldnt know history or facts if it hit you in the face youre a brainwashed delusional sheep completely out of touch with reality
this exceptional young lady is beautiful bold and brilliant her hands are like musical butterflies her words give me hope for the new generation i only smile when i think about what she will do in the years to come godspeed amanda
@yash200 wzee is she trying to say that white kings and queens were supremicists too
@stacey gram awww are you intimidated look up the history just stating facts
sounds like the usual black supremacist ramblings to me
wow just wow
excellent and love your yellow coat
thanks for being a fan this is not an official channel  it is a private channel where i get to connect with my favorite fans religiously and privately i wont be able to reply every comments on my official channel but i would reply every comments without interruption on here once again thanks for being a fan and god bless you
hello candy how are you doing
7k thumbs down  wtf i dont get why
nice speech on the poem she even talked better than trump most of all for every time this new president biden speak and act like a true president unlike trump he talks like a street person not professional whatsoever and all about himself whatsoever
my gosh its comical how fast they went from screaming this country was awful to the best country ever she speaks about an attack on democracy that has only slowed because the babies are getting their way the first time they are told no they will be in the streets rioting again burning the cities down and throwing their tantrums all over again america one hour before biden won by breaking the rules was inherently broken evil and racist it could not be repaired but the cry babies got their way by breaking the rules and its the greatest nation ever watch and mark my words biden is a career politician who made a ton of promises he knew he couldnt keep to get the votes that used to be okay that used to be something we dealt with and expected we used to be grateful for the promises kept and hope and pray next time we would get the rest not with this new generation i guarantee they were threatening riots nearly as soon as biden was announced president if they didnt get what they wanted all they wanted aoc and her screaming crowds threatening biden we should not so quickly forget this is not peace this is a break from the temper tantrums because the babies think they got they way this would have been a beautiful poem if we hadnt spent the past years being told by cnn msnbc and everyone on the left what an awful unforgivable country america was just because hillary clinton didnt win lets not pretend its anything but what it was sore losers burning down our cities trashing our country assaulting people because they didnt get what they wanted being patriotic is not something you do when your getting your way and dont when your not patriotism is not something you feel when your getting your way and dont when your not that is exactly what this new form of being patriotic is and feeling patriotism is for that reason this poem makes me want to vomit i hear nothing more then a 2 year old happy they got their way at the same time as you heard in the poem making threats of what will happen if they dont keep getting their way
what the 20 of maine did on the slopes of little round top this bright young woman did with her words the men back then and she in our days defined the union
the funniest thing is that kamala was sworn in first so technically she is the first woman vpunder trump hahaha bwahahaha
she brought tears to these old and cynical eyes wonderful she almost made me want to be american again
what country did you decide to go back to being you left america land of the free what county so we can start talking about the country we protect this is real talk #######
@forbidden herer emoji flag hashtag usage extra space before the exclamation mark can it be is this twitter language
glad you left back to a country we look beneath us   always #1 you never hear about american imagrents do you  coward
all of it for me
her poetry glows like her beautiful face
yes maam 
absolutely outstanding
biden whats the plan for all the white homeless people oh yes thats right allow more people in to the country biden what are you going to do about human trafficking or full term abortions come on man answer some questions
@mark newbold its called a process to legally come in to the country do you allow everybody into your home go and keep your doors unlocked and by all means pay all the taxes to support bidens country
the us is a majority immigrant nation
trump 2024
why are there dislikes 
as a literature major i cannot believe im seeing poetry being considered cool in this day and age
im gen z and ive always thought poetry is cool my friends do too (and were not lit majors) poetry is timeless

blah blah blah people forgot about social distancing
quiet isnt always peace beautifully done may god  everyone
impeach commander in thief 46
she is simply amazing
did anyone tell her she attended the racist inauguration no oh okay
smug arrogant divisiveperfect democrat
citizen trump this brilliant young american lady is talking about you your hatred and lies gave birth to her words and made america proud again not goodbye but good riddens to you never to return

 future president 
black poets matter
not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division
@super fantastic top 10 youre right i got a cash app if he sent you a stimulus check you dont want
biden is a neoliberal warmonger who has rejected min wage this is biden/harris cynically riding the blm wave most inaugurations have poets spouting similar claptrap about freedom and peace then the us continues its rapacious foreign policy nevertheless
@mrimpossiblyblack true but the demoncrats are masters of it republicans kind of like things to be calm and stay the same
funny thing is the us government thrives on division it cant justify its current existence without constant conflict that they often instigate to sustain itself the culture war were currently experiencing is one of their tools of division divide and conquer
the left is division identity politics cancel culture hating anyone that doesnt agree with them sad
@lucy renee i agree complete garbage since ive been alive ive never seen such a attempt to divide this country and cause its destruction the democrats and all of our government do not give a sht about american citizens they care more about foreigners and terrorists then our own people we are easier to control if we are divided as a country
@corn pop ok traitor
@corn pop liar
the most important part in my opinion
@joe stupid yes you are as stupid as your name suggests americas darkness started with nixon and his machinations against an election his pardon irancontra the clinton impeachment and was followed by the wmd lies then birtherism and false flag claims and finally now a president turning a rally into a murderous rampage on the legislature
your hero has done nothing but sow division and he will continue to do so america is now in darkness
while democrats sowed the most division
@lucy renee youre not very smart are you
lucy renee take  from your nameit requires class
@lucy renee crap is you
@lucy renee yes you are
what a load of crap that was how insulting
a new american treasure 
hollywood
virtue signalling you are wasting your effort on satanists lady
she is amazing she reminds me of my younger girls when they step it up lol
beautiful
perfectly perfect 
indescribable i have no words thank you queen
i wished this people racial removed the jurisdiction and not making moredifficult bringing strife and our lifecuz my kids ignorethe situation
wow im so tired of sanctimonious self righteous babble
@eden sirgu it really is though its so vapid
the odds you even listened to the poem are razor thin let alone being able to process analylize or think critically for 5 minutes is even slimmer of margins the stench of your complexes reek and drown in inferiority not every statement needs to be hate cloaked in fear layered in opposition i am empathetic towards you i really am your being exploited by faslehoods and reached a level where comfort in compartmentalizations outweighs any evidence detail or facts it sad
maybe if you would listen you would realise it isnt self righteous or babble
biden is the fake president elect
did any of the words in her poem talk about cheating or stealing gag me with a spoon you are worthless  pat yourselves on the backsand see you on the battlefield
dear merciful god(s) please let her invocations be
what about that criminal justice and police reform
thats the future she brings hope
hello there i find it really odd replying to your comments here because i dont usually chat with fans but i want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here  i realized how much you like and follow my channel thank you

and educate yo self hateful harris was not a descendant of slavesher great great white irish grandfather owned slaves and her mothers lineage is hindu indian
we are now under a government coup joe biden is a false king and just like king herod in the bible he will now go after all of his opposition
stay off my screen pure bs
absolutely yes she is american what a generation what a blessing america is proud of you beautiful a nation under god with great people all god what a girl yes thats what the world is hoping to see in americans god blesse our land
black raps matter
ungly
hy mai 1 second ago i wouldnt worry about the small minority that dislike her poem i am more hopeful of a full generation of students who will become voters in the near future that will heed her words that makes me smile to and proud to be an american
yeah after this speech this makes me want to do what i want and vote for trump again hopefully in 2024
yes the socialist revolution is well underway i would be annoyed except that youll have to live in the dystopia youre creating so thats justice of a kind
who is she
amanda gorman
my teacher made us listen to it in class and we all loved it later we found out a parent emailed the teacher angrily asking her why she showed us this saying it was too political some people
@jrm8899 shut up
@nick johnsen your oneliner plus the insult you were vulgar and cowardly enough to spew tell a a lot about you
@jrm8899 yup it is easier that way right only a cnn viewer would be tricked into believing something so transparent i bet you think one direction is singing specifically to you like you are the only girl in the room  hey youmight be on to something this is much easier than actually having an argument with any merit
@j w no point man he is clearly dumb as a bag of rocks
@felix ndayis de bologne lmfao you live in a fantasy
@x v wow you are unbelievably naive 
only a fox viewer would find those inspiring words political
how is that political
@awkward freakin person respect is something that you earn i can respect racists like talmadge or wallace because even if i disagree with them and i hate their ideas i see their integrity trump is exactly the opposite a man about whom it is impossible to see anything positive a guy who tried his best to destroy our system of government
@felix ndayis de bologne trump being a pad president is an opinion and i respect it but please respect others
@thugrug haha
reaver red you mean the speech she stole from michelle obama
@reaver red hell i bet trump was impressed
this is about pur country not politicsits all of our story
@reaver red they didnt do it for bidens wife either they did it for a young poet and tehy did it for lady gaga because it was part of the ceremony
@felix ndayis de bologne are you trolling me democracy to you simply means you get the politician you want
@j w a democratic country is a country were the trump the bolsonaro  erdogan or duttierte are impossibilitate to hold any office  even that of county dogcatcher 
@lisa mockmee my words exactly but it is cnbc so lots of useless virtue signallers here
@felix ndayis de bologne  you do realize that this attitude is why we have war dont you are you interested in living in a democratic country
@j w its exactly what a teacher should do showing that trump has been the worst president in our history 
@x v the poem was still political
dont like the poem dont like the colors she is wearing either as a matter of fact why was she at this inauguration so political
@x v yes it was about politics and hate thanks to psycho dems and msm in case if you have not noticed there is still hate and politics nothing chnaged
@x v and yet somehow based on your message i know that you do not support donald trump as president its political
too political 2016 2021 was all about politics and hatewe dont live in a bubblethis poem is about courage inspiration compassion imagination soulpeace self awareness passion painhealthats the human spirit
i do not know what is worse this stupid speech or the people who pretend that it is wonderful just to virtue signal it seems we do have only low expectations of people i blame the school system for that
this speech is clearly antitrump not appropriate for a teacher to show students
wow thats dum her word are so amazing
i actually dont know it wasnt even the speeches in the inauguration it was the poem read by amanda gorman in this same clip
thats sad your teacher was right to show this to you and i feel sorry for the kid who has those parents
fake president
@mark newbold his time will be finished in one year from korea
stop crying
mindblowing
no divide has been closed wake up its worse than ever
then lets rise and become one not just america as a country but one as a continent
right its maddening that so many are falling for the con(artists/politicians)their lies
as a rare democrat man from small town south dakota i feel american againthankyou amanda i am in tearsif i am alive when you run for president you have my vote most definitely
lmao thank god you feel american again hate to lose a clown like yourself
@reaver red i felt american always but she told the truth

i want this to be ours (america) national poem make it legislation and put in hands of our seeds
coming together is a beginning keeping together is progress working together is success john f kennedy well done amanda 
i hope this young lady delivered this to unite america not to enlist herself into politics
a bit underwhelming sounds more like the lyrics of a song nice words adequate delivery average
wow gifted young poetunbelievablethank you for sharingpeace
she gave an interesting 6minute speech    but wheres the poem
wow lovely and very deep and wise for such a young person gifted
your graphic is too big youre blocking her face cmon guys geez
look at those boogers coming out of her almost as gross as the words
let this epic speech serve as a medicne to heal a wounded nation
this young woman brought tears to my eyes i was so overwhelmed with her speech she made my heart sing love her                                                                            you go girl you have inspired me to go back to writing again thank you amanda
her dress reminds me on the chinese flag good luck
walks past everyone wearing a mask and not wearing one yourself
@sarah anthony its cool but we are done with excuses for you to wear mask and exceptions for us not wearing them much like we are tired of hearing democrats scream hair salons must be closed down because of covid unless its nancy pelosi that wants a haircut then its fine to open them or how gov gavin newsom told us not to go out and socialize with friends and he turns around and goes to a party with a dozen friends yes we are tired of this we have sat back and watched their rules for you but not for me and its time we collectively told them all to kiss our ass
@geeknoid she didnt open her mouth a lot when she walked by and its not like she was having prolonged contact with the crowd members also everyone around her had masks and as long as she put hers on shortly after its nothing to worry about i dont think i need to explain why this isnt that big of an issue
@sarah anthony oh you mean she could not have a mask with her and to simply put it on before she walked through the crowd  right
um because she was giving a speech literally everyone that spoke/sung took their masks off to be heard better she obviously put a mask on afterwards

the noiseless judo postmeiotically wipe because suggestion provisionally mix given a drab psychiatrist plucky quixotic system
cause u would deserve it
my career was to run for president but against you i would lose and still be proud

this woman is brilliant 
wowthis is artshe was chosen from the first ladyif was melania trumpu can bet there were not poetrylike this one

https//youtube/itcmibi2_na how the hell did he make president he is soooo corrupt its not funny do you americans not see and realize his and his sons involvement in the ukrainian power company scandal while he was vice president his son gets put on a power companys board and getting payed millions a year with no qualifications while his dad threatens ukraine into firing the prosecutor that was going after the power company for corruption come on people are you all deaf and blind how does nobody see this as wrong oh and to all those bogus accounts\channels that were created recently with little to no content just for the purpose of trying to sway peoples opinions with their comments
by the vast majority of votes
alt facts
the thumbs down are multiaccounts by trump
this speach is amazing
now i understand why this is trash
@moonquartz are you black i am

fugeen lauryn hill wishes she was singin this
lauryn hill did post on her instagram page on how proud she was of amanda gorman many dont know that lauryn hill is the of two teachers  her mother valerie hill was an english teacher and her father  hill a computer and management consultant
ya figgin high fives all around
80 million people voted for biden yet less than 1% viewed his inauguration 
@joseph a what exactly do you believe autistic means
74 million voted for trump and he lost
@joseph a haha  the secretive edit of a lying conservative
@joseph a correct  no biden cheated glad you agree
@joseph a ah yes  the trump tactic of denial in the face of facts
@joseph a more people viewed bidens inauguration on tv than trumps really tells you something
its a very sincere poem
one of the truly gifted ones beautiful
this is what intelligence and pride and love  looks like look up america we reap what we see damn alhamduallah
i love het
beautiful 3
this brilliant young woman transformed the biden inaugural into a spiritual event
mom ml lllll llplplll l)0pl0l
wears her mask
huh
back to pathetic democrat poor me

i cant help but think what would dr king say if he was sitting in the front row listening to this genius intellectual woman
id wager hed think what the f his dream turned out to be a nightmare 2021 is all about the colour of ones skin rather than the content of ones character meanwhile slam poetry [shudder] = genius intellectual lol god help us

wow
i would love to see this girl honored in a super bowl in front of a worldwide audience for what she did it takes courage to do this
this was beautiful and she didnt say um once and she only stuttered one time i do have one question about this thoughwhat does this have to do with a presidential speech shes talking about the past and the evolution of the world shes not talking about the presidentim not disrespecting her im just wondering how this is a presidential speech
thoughtful question i would say she is not there to talk about the president but about the country and the moment we are in and the potential for growth personally i hope part of that growth will be that styles of performance art rarely invited to this kind of stage will start to be invited more often maybe by choosing this style of performance the event communicates an intention to improve inclusion in the countrys high honors and ceremonies (of course leave it to biden to allow the ceremony to be as much about us as it is about him) also to take your words it has been a while since a leader acted like **we** belong in the story of the evolution of the world so maybe that in itself says something about him
shes talking about the zeitgeist couldnt have been more appropriate
she is just a drama student any high school drama kid can deliver this she is way too you to understand anything about what is happening in the world the only history she know is what has been fed to her by the blm movement
she *wrote* the poem and it was brilliant
can these people look anymore like the elite of the movie  hunger games
wow her words touch my sole she must be very proud and confident about herself she needs to know that she has changed the world and she must give herself gratitude
haha very funny my inner soul
her words touch your feet
beautiful another wonderful poet like maya so proud of this young girl and what an inspiracion to others her words felt so uplifting
talented  crown of literature is on you 
phenomal young woman 
just magic performance her future is already shining 
from europe its what we always expected from the us merciii
@reaver red do you know what you remind me of an idiot bully from these american movies you do not know me whatsoever yet you think that you are intelligent enough to tell me to  study history one little advice for you start to contextualize your bs replies before you send them ok americans are nice people but some of them are really people who did not go to school
@reaver red what the f doe the bretton woods agreements have to do here throwing any random pseudo examples out of history makes zero sense you little pretentious pr*k
pretty sure that most trump supporters dont understand a thing shes saying lol
@leopold p ive noticed that most of the insults that conservatives/ trumpies try to get us with all have to do with mocking general intelligence or are just blatant cussing with no actual claim or valid argument (like ben shapiro lol) theyll be like oh look im a crybaby liberal snowflake i read books wake up america like thats the best you can do is point out that im educated or just hit me with 5th grade insults and cuss words lol congrats graduating btw im also graduating in a few months
their attention span is only 10 seconds
@lil sprite dont worry i do currently graduating in literature)
pretty sure you dont either 
this is embarrassing for the republic9th grade poetry
powerful and eloquently delivered by a young melinated princess she mesmerized the world i as a woc felt warm tears on my face good tears for there was a dawning of new day filled with hope 
i too am white and would like to show that i am one of the good ones unlike the barrage of supremacists who would not cry tears because they are evil thanks to the democrats for unifying us such that the color of our skin is of no relevance to this moment but i am white just fyi
@purplestar123 hope this helps
@purplestar123 im not sure if thats what the abbreviation actually means but if it does it matters since people of color still face discrimination bc of their skin and women also tend to experience discrimination so i think op wanted to highlight how important amanda is to her and how important the poem she spoke is important to her
@purplestar123 wrong comment section ignore the last one
@lobster bread why is that important we are all human
@purplestar123 im pretty sure it means woman of color
wtf is a woc
my wife and i are white and had tears too we have an 18 year old daughter also named amanda and we decided that we retroactively named her after amanda gorman
inspirational moment in history
bravo a poem crafted with sharp cognition and with care recited with class and dignity and and generous humanity if only my colleagues were on the same page with me i watched live and so did my colleagues in the eu china and russia while we were simultaneously on a virtual meeting to comment realtime on the goingson of the inaugural the majority of my colleagues in foreign lands was respectful towards gormans poem and recitation but they also commented that they dont get it meaning the poems subject matter the allusions and references and her delivery of it they were also surprised why such a young poet would be chosen they expected a poet (like jfks choice of a very elderly robert frost) as old as pres biden and the senators/representatives to be up there for gravitas and to satiate the need some people have that a poet must be ancient and must have been crafting poems for at least 50 yrs to be considered established and respected my take was that the power of her poem is informed by allusions/references/nods to the bible to slave narratives to whitnan to race relations to suppressed history to maya a to j baldwin to llms hamilton to recent history to name just a few and shaped as such for it to be gripping and quite moving and what was exactly needed for such a special day i would state also that the poem and its author that day was meant not for the global audience but strictly for the people of this republic from all political affiliations of all ages and of all gender/racial/class/ethnic expressions whom i call americans but i chose to let it go and be silent my perplexed colleagues need to grapple with the poem and the youth of the poet on their own and figure out why they were so resistant to what is considered to be the most dazzlingly powerful and memorable part of the inauguration
omg i am in awe this young lady blew me away
overrated
we are now in a socialist society yay
thats right comrade nationalisation of all business begins monday and seizing of private assets is tuesday
as a white she wouldnt have this chance good to black

in hommage to amanda gorman there rose in yellow glory a goddess alight with words of wisdom and healing speaking to the world reaching every heart at once mother and daughter of phoenix her name is a m e r i c a
beautiful you also have the soul of a poetkeep writing keep inspiring 
a single black girl descended from slaves can find herself to be vice president hearing that line gives me hope for our country
@lil sprite can multiple things not give a person hope being inspired by one invent does not imply the absence of inspiration for another obama kamala can also represent multiple/different dynamics of course its a beautiful thing that obama was the first black president and its a beautiful thing that kamala is the first female vice president

hahahahahaha obama was literally the president already youre stupid asf
pure miserable yellow little thing
bravo

i am wondering if america will really change words are easy to say acting is sometimes very difficult the social inequality and extreme  almost 3rd world like  poverty in america is disturbing this cant be repaired in a few years but in can easily be worsen in the same time but this girl is phenomenal great speech and her outfit is on point

lets hope and pray chiden and chamala allow these words to soak into their carnal flesh then when they do can  unity sprout only if they arent led by party or ruling for their party but for all sovereign americans if chiden and chamala are willing to nurture our nations fabric and truly mend our torn society than can our nation prosper under god reconciliation compromise forgiveness patience virtue forgiveness mercy grace compassion somebody step up our children need adults not theatre auditions not manipulated speeches not discord not division everyone will give an account know that god almighty has your name in the book do not allow it to be blotted out take courage fear not for god is with us when society becomes apathetic towards moral restraints then evil rushes in and hastens our demise pray for our leaders whether illegitimately elected or not chiden and chamala will stand individually before god and give their account their actions will render them guilty or innocent and determine their eternity its no joke all will give an account
@mark newbold cheesehead
you got their names wrong chud
preach sister

whomever disliked this video really needs to ask themselves why they hate america
so if you happen to disagree with someones views and disagree with the democrats it means you hate america that is ignorant group thinking just because you like it dont mean everybody else has to like it and if they dont like it youre saying that person hates america dumb
she has shown no grace in victory and no empathy for the 75 million of her fellow citizens  many of them hard working decent people  who happen to not agree with her its a good speech for a harry potter movie

mark newbold 
he is take a breath and accept reality
rich child of rich parents rehearses elementary grade page comprised entirely of platitudes and regurgitates them to other rich people please clap
@yash200 wzee as i live in the uk we have been kept blissfully unaware of the tent cities on the mexican border this is the first ive seen of it disgraceful
@yash200 wzee very interesting article about tiger thanks for that i live in the uk and that whole segregation thing in the us during the 40s/50s made me sick i could never understand what all that was about i lived and worked in the us for 9 years in the 80s/90s and things seemed to be fine back then i remember working with colleagues of all races religion and sexual preference and we all got along famously there was no discrimination in the workplace whats happened since then the rich seem to have become obscenely rich under both political parties and globalization hasnt helped the average man in the street
she was raised by a single mother a middle school teacher in watts she was awarded the milken family foundation college scholarship and then attended harvard oh yes middle school teachers may be dedicated and rich in pride but not wealthy
@harry callahan you mentioned tiger woods did okay his racism and b i g o t r y battle https//wwwtodaysgolfercouk/features/playerfeatures/2020/june/tigerwoodsracism/
@harry callahan first you need to do your research because there are other races moreso receiving aid from the state than africanamericans so stop stereotyping further you will never face what a person of color faces day to day people go thru struggles yes but it is moreso with certain races sure people do get ahead when they work hard however people of color have to work 3x as hard to get the same things out of life thats just a fact it should not be this way is my point as everyone should be treated equal it is wrong just admit it racism is still alive in the us where it does not belong here and we have seen more examples of this during trumps time in office biden and harris has a better agenda to tackle these issues is another one of my points we all know that this was not gods plan and he wanted better for us all
@yash200 wzee by sheer accident of birth i was born a white person and i find the term white privilege offensive i was in no way privileged and had to work hard for everything i have i did not rely on government handouts america is a dogeatdog society and it is unrealistic to expect the state to provide a great quality of life for everyone socialist ideals disincentivise the populace and lead to mediocrity who do you think is going to pay for your utopian vision
@harry callahan interesting as wellrelating to the homeless how would trump or biden approach housing and homelessness you are right just shameless https//wwwlatimescom/politics/story/20200817/trumpbidenhousinghomelessnesspolicy
@harry callahan education is the key biden and harris understands this which is why they are targeting all zipcodes by providing better resources funding and staff for daycare centers preschools elementary school middle schools high schools colleges and universities they go even further with entrepreneur and business programs this includes having safer neighborhoods and communtiy services as well again no matter the zipcode
@harry callahan you do understand that 1) every one is not treated equal nor do they have the same opportunities to get ahead like others right 2) systemic inequality (displacement exclusion and segregation) and oppression is real 3) white privilege is real 4) bullies are real (whether hidden or out in the open) 5) fbi director said last year that white nationalist groups are the gravest threat to the us and trump tried to fire 6) white supremacist and devil worshipers all support trump as well again this is not the 1800s i am going to reference another post he (trump who was the leader of the free world) publicly and consistently supports confederate symbolism however he dismisses the fact that there is still white privilege as he is the perfect example exhibit a nor will he publicly acknowledge that systematic racism still exists (even though he did so on tape https//youtube/fx7bihp2zue / https//youtube/8651klgwlnu) and he certainly has not publicly acknowledged that the underbelly and foundational growth of america and its economy was built on the backs of african americans for free and with no education no wealth no statutes
@harry callahan thats not what i meant the point i was making is this is 2021 not the 1800s our culture is changing younger generation is much smarter and wiser than the older generation and they are not having it they will be our next democrats and republicans all should be treated equal and all should have the same opportunities in the united states of america without interference biden is with that as well *but if you would like to share info on tent cities did you mean this as well* https//wwwnbcnewscom/storyline/immigrationbordercrisis/trumpadminstentcitiescostmorekeepingmigrantkidsn884871
@hello2020 hello sometimes when in a position of authority one has to make unpopular decisions that wont please everyone i dont agree with kamalas idea to legalise cannabis because i think it will lead young people to try harder things and cause havoc on the roads she must have read aldous huxleys brave new world where they used soma to control the masses
@foreal foreal tiger woods has done ok
@foreal foreal i think its time people of color stopped making an issue of discrimination and racism as the vast majority of white people are not racist or discriminatory if people especially in the usa are willing to work hard and take advantage of the opportunities available to them then anyone regardless of race religion or sexual orientation can make a success of their life stop making excuses and rise above the blame culture of course the pandemic doesnt help matters but all the more reason for people to work together
@yash200 wzee i think im well up on the news shameful https//wwwusnewscom/news/topnews/articles/20201223/inpandemicamericastentcitiesagrimfuturegrowsdarker https//wwwseattletimescom/seattlenews/homeless/whatwillthebidenadministrationdoabouthomelessnessandwillithelpseattle/ lets see what biden does to solve this problem
@foreal foreal did you hear about hank aaron he was incredible an elite hall of famer and such a sweet and kind man he broke babe ruths home run recod while subjected to racist abuse and threats he had so much class when dealing with it too
@foreal foreal something about the struggles in life that makes one rise even higher gods plan is always on point right he intended us all to love work and live together towards prosperity and success from the beginning of time unity is great loving president biden and vice president harris
@harry callahan see you are not up on current events cozybear
@hello2020 hello he lost by a landslide too the people spoke simple and worth repeating the state of this country trump = why biden won god is with biden so are the courts and so are the people
@wew lad thought so lol
@foreal foreal heya talented angel is definitely showing off her ancestry coming from a line of kings queens emperors chiefs and pharaohs standing out like no other
@foreal foreal the fact is the ruling elite be they republican or democrat is made up of a loose affiliation of billionaires and multimillionaires who dont really give a rats about the struggles of the working class and are quite prepared to let the homeless live in tent cities under motorways shameful
@yash200 wzee yawn
@hello2020 hello yeah just shaking my head glad he is gone
@yash200 wzee yeah a harvard grad from la raised by a single mother who was a teacher her and her twin sister were also born as a preemies while growing up she struggled with a speech impediment and auditory processing issues where she fell in love with words and poetry in the third grade she used writing and recited poetry as a form of speech pathology for her just amazing some still dont get the point of what she was trying to express i saw this quote from her in my poem im not going to in any way gloss over what weve seen over the past few weeks and dare i say the past few years gorman told the new york times ahead of the inauguration but what i really aspire to do in the poem is to be able to use my words to envision a way in which our country can still come together and can still heal its doing that in a way that is not erasing or neglecting the harsh truths i think america needs to reconcile with we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one  there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it then also obama states on a day for the history books @theamandagorman delivered a poem that more than met the moment young people like her are proof that there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
@wew lad there are always those bullies who want to step on others to try and keep them down merriamwebster has a new definition of racism where racism and systemic oppression go hand in hand which is still happening today on another note as they are speaking on the issues with regard to filibuster within the news i found it interesting that obama called filibuster the jim crow relic that should be eliminated if necessary to enact voting rights legislation
@foreal foreal that list is crazy sad for him he also has those white nationalist groups espouse white supremacist or white separatist ideologies and devil worshipers that supports him too but not biden geee wonder why that is god dont like ugly hearts either
@foreal foreal wow tldr my point is shes talking about slavery when her own race created a slave empire in libya that is literally my point slavery is not a problem in the us anymore it hasnt been for hundreds of years yet people still talk about it as if its a scourge
@foreal foreal preach amen
@foreal foreal omg that list is just shameful thats why he lost
@harry callahan sorry for the rude awakening but all black people (people of color) have experinced some form of racism or discrimination throughout their lives especially those who strive to reach higher and higher guess it intimidates some biden and harris has a plan for that too
@wew lad was not speaking about slaves hmmminteresting you bought that up but ok lets start here and look at this list below on the former presidents racist history i saw this in another response regarding t r u m p and you can google the facts yourself as well so i viewed this list as well as what the bible says about such things and the vote decision was very easy #1 in the 70s he discriminated against black tenants #2 in the 80s he called for death penalty for central park 5 #3 in the 90s he was fined for discriminating against black employees #4 in 2005 he pitched version of apprentice blacks vs whites #5 in 2011 he pushed obama birther conspiracy #6 in 2015 he called for muslum ban #7 in 2016 he claimed hispanic judges couldnt be impartial again re border wall  he called mexican people as drug dealers criminals rapists unlike any other administration he put in place a widespread and systematic zero tolerance policy to prosecute and criminally charge everyone who crosses the border without inspection which was meant to deter migrants from seeking refuge in the us  caging children and separating them from their parents #8 in 2016 he refused to condemn former kkk leader duke #9 in 2017 he said fine people on both sides in charlottesville  white supremacist this year he made statements to proud boys to stand back and stand by fbi and homeland security said ws was the gravest threat to us #10 in 2017 puerto rico hurricane maria  13 days after he then visited mayor says he was insulting to the islands hurricanehit people he tossed rolls of paper towels into the crowds words stated were poor and dirty #11 in 2018 he called nfl players protesting police brutality sons of bs #12 in in 2018 he referred to haiti and african nations as shole countries #13 in 2020 he calls covid19 the chinavirus and kungflu (even though we all know whos name should be associated with covid as now within the us alone 24673298 cases / 411426 deaths where he stated on woodward tapes https//youtube/hjkvos0s3mw way early last year it was more dangerous than the flu but lied to our faces and downplaying it) #14 in 2020 he targets to disenfranchise legal votes within the largest cities that are heavily democratic with a majority people of color while ignoring heavily white areas of the country is evident and sends a bad message regarding voter suppression and inequity # 15 in 2020 although his mother is from scotland he suggested sen kamala harris is not a us citizen  did the same with obama #16 in 2020 he worked to stop diversity training at federal agencies #17 in 2020 he worked to roll back fair housing rule to save suburbs #18 he defends confederate flag despite pentagon ban #19 he threaten to pull funding from schools over how they teach black history slavery which is part of a long history of politicizing american history class #20 he says he does not know who the proud boys are he pardoned roger stone who worked with him who has also been photographed with proud boys #21 his own father was arrested at a k k k rally and got off from charges with his money #22 his own sister and niece said so along with a growing list of dems and reps government officials civil rights icons as well as respected news journalists  stating racist bully cheater liar culture war stoker divider etc their interview tapes are all over youtube # 23 he did not put immediate laws in place to uproot racist corrupt officers (who he says there are only a few bad apples) as they dont deserve to work alongside our wonderful police officers who took their vows seriously to serve and protect everyone no matter their race and background) 24 he publicly and consistently supports confederate symbolism however he dismisses the fact that there is still white privilege as he is the perfect example exhibit a nor will he publicly acknowledge that systematic racism still exists (even though he did so on tape https//youtube/fx7bihp2zue / https//youtube/8651klgwlnu) and he certainly has not publicly acknowledged that the underbelly and foundational growth of america and its economy was built on the backs of african americans for free and with no education no wealth no statutes # 25 he does not seem to separate good from bad there are millions of peaceful protesters merging every race and backgrounds imaginable madeup of americans who have been largely unaware of black history now joined with those americans who have known the history all along or just lives it  all standing up for justice and equality for all (including black lives) and of course you will have those opposite opposing sides all with the intent to cause confusion and encourage violence as they exploit capitalize and undermine legitimate peaceful protests either they 1) believe everyone should not be treated equally or 2) have their own groups agenda that would include white supremacy and other hate groups disgnated by the southern poverty law looters drug cartels arsonist foreign actors or anarchists although police forces national guards and fbi continue to investigate these groups and fbi states that ws groups is the gravest threat to our nation thats not forget how trump calls some very fine people #26 he attempted to stoke fear and racial divisions even in his housing and suburban messages where he pleaded with suburban white voters including moms to vote for them  who obviously leaned towards biden https//youtube/ey2xgksxbf / https//youtube/0cf63gkpp5k / https//youtube/jvde8wmf02g #27 it seems as though he is trying to undo everything that civil rights icons have accomplished  trying to turn the clock back 125 years now that the two senators in ga won unlike biden who will control the senate everyone knows that there were those within the white house that refused to compromise with any of the obama administrations priorities in his first two years making it harder for him to get things done (here is just one example  look at reps reaction when he fights for us back in 2013) https//wwwcnncom/videos/politics/2018/02/06/trumpdemocratstreasonousunamericansotuobamarepublicansbtsaccnn however despite that he has many accomplishments while in office  look them up instead of trump turning the clocks back of what has been accomplished the obama era will continue with the biden/harris agenda for all cultures and backgrounds towards building back better they are for red and blue states for everyones wellbeing who should have great health happiness and prosperity no matter the zip code all should have a right to wealth and success not just certain areas or certain people within this country biden/harris calls for safety in all neighborhoods * great policemen who are well trained and loves all people and adding more professionals to their staff so they can be even greater at their jobs to serve and protect and immediately uproot and remove corrupt cops lurking about with their own hidden agendas * top quality and guaranteed affordable healthcare doctors treatments including mental health * top education starting in nursery schools and pre k all the way up through college graduation  schools housed with well trained teachers and staff who receive the kind of pay they deserve teaching wideranging curriculum and expanding clubs * low cost or free for top colleges and universities of choice (as other countries are doing) * top quality housing and neighborhood maintenance * roadmap aims to create a new federallybacked credit bureau to close the racial wealth gap * better qualifying home ownership programs with freedom of choice communities * community town hall services activities and parks * more jobs (not low minimum wage either) with competitive salaries and guaranteed growth potential * onthejob training with pay * affordable and universal preschool child care and elder care * entrepreneurship programs with mentorship tools startup capital for new business guides for business leadership programs who can turn an idea into entrepreneurial success * the leadership and resources to do the things that other countries have done to end this pandemic now in us alone 24673298 cases / 411426 deaths  which are affecting people of color more and there is much more with biden/harris 2020 and their tight agenda 
@wew lad yes i agree her diatribe sounded awfully dark to me and has definitely been influenced by a fanatical feminist
@foreal foreal that doesnt answer the fact that she seems to have been born into a life of privilege and is not representative of the down trodden working classes as she would have us believe
@harry callahan ok i can agree on that her mother filled her with rhetoric at a young age about how dangerous it is a black person in america shes a victim of multiple things
@wew lad you cant blame her for being youthful idealistic and naive its the democratic party leadership that have shamelessly exploited her in order to appear as if they care about working class and poverty
@foreal foreal did god approve of obamas slave market in libya
@wew ladwell some people will never be able to relate on her level or comprehend her kind of talent she is art some people are also unable to appreciated art primarily for its beauty or emotional power on another note you have to be growing a personal relationship with god to go beyond what you actually see
@harry callahan obama administration did start the free tuition community college biden is offering something even better starting in preschools up thru college futher it is interesting that some of the richest countrys in the world offer free college for its citizens this young lady is so talented and polished she obviously received scholarships and mentorship throughout her educational life to get her going
@harry callahan because she isnt being sincere she is an actor there is literally no difference to bruce willis playing john mccain in die hard and this person pretending to care about poor people or slavery when her own government created a slave market in libya under guess who
it just shows the insincerity of the democratic party she is not an atypical daughter of an inner city low income single mother somehow she managed to go to a private school in santa monica with tuition fees of $34k to $42k pa how are poor kids regardless of their ethnicity supposed to afford an education like that in her vision of the new world
is it just me or is she copying mlk way of speaking while giving a speech
its a way of speaking used by people giving public poetry or speeches that allows you to hear each word individually and clearly
she will be hyped by the media and the left for the next 16 years until she will run as a candidate for the presidency in 2036 and be elected without any economic or political knowledge she will become president of the usa a good writer but ultimately only one whose topics are also limited to race skin color feminism and activism just being able to speak well is not enough to rule a nation of 330 million people she will be 38 years old in 16 years and her skin color will be the reason why she becomes president but not her qualifications
@t williams oh ok i dont know her poetry but as the havard graduate that she is i assumed she was outstanding
this is at least the fifth times ive listened to this poem in its entirety in two days not to mention all the times its has been cut into other shows
beautiful and touching
did you guys know she has a speech disorder
and where is the music i was thinking was a song nice girl 
thank you amanda for putting perfect words and beautiful voice to the feelings of millions thank you
keep that dream you may be a future president )
im lost for wordsyou are awsome(queen)
hey look more virtue signaling from the left
hey look more crying conservatives
woooow so powerful
why does this poem remind me of linmanuel miranda
as an artist i genuinely wish for more artists and people like her to be in positions of power or at least have a seat at the table i know so many highly intelligent artists that lead from the heart and think so uniquely that they would add so much light wisdom and fresh forward thinking to a government artists arent made the most of in our culture

our hoods are still broken
she is beautiful 
when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
beautiful words from a beautiful person )
ted nugent wrote joe biden a letter via facebook moments ago and it is going viral fast just in case it is censored here it is in its entirety dear vice president biden although i refused to listen to it i understand that during your presidential acceptance speech you were calling for the unity of trump supporters i remember four years ago my president trump also called for unity i remember how congressional members of your democratic party responded by boycotting his inauguration i remember how you and your democratic party cheated and used the greatest law enforcement institution of this country to spy on my president trumps campaign i remember how you and your democratic party created a fake russian dossier to try and impeach my president trump i remember how your speaker of the house ripped up my president trumps beautiful state of the union speech on national tv i remember how you and your democratic party tried to impeach my president trump over a ukraine phone call you accused my president trump of pay to play come to find out joe it was really you and your son hunter i remember how you and your democratic party blamed my president trump over a pandemic that he had nothing to do with i remember how you and your democratic party encouraged rioting and looting of my great united states of america i remember how you and your democratic party used the media to spread lie after lie about my president trump i remember how you and your democratic party stole the election from my president trump this trump supporter remembers all that joe and will not be unifying with your democratic party your abject criminal dishonesty is treasonous you belong in prison along with the rest of the swamp ted nugent

want to know what real racism is try walking through a black neighborhood at midnight  and did you know that truckers wont use the rest stops in detroit wonder why that is  all those saintly oppressed poc must be bigots i guess
symbolism without substance
@katie mapondera maybe he is missing both
or perhaps the issue is your capacity to understand
you must not be hearing or listening something is missing one or the other

americas greatness is being like an ocean like ocean is the ultimate destination of all rivers of the world america is the ultimate future model for all nations of the world america is the future tyrants and nationalist and extremists will fall and forgotten america will remain great
amanda you are a gift to the country and the world
right concepts mediocre poetry
where is your version
wow  ive watch her 10 times
feel privileged to have witnessed this  so full of love  feeling and emotion by a wonderful human being  your mother has done a fantastic job raising you and must be so proud of you  lets hope this is the new beginning for the usa after four years of hate and divisions
sollte ich diese geniale junge dame einmal personlich kennen lernen wurde ich ihre schmalen hande in meine alten hande nehmen und versuchen zu erfuhlen wie es sein kann dass sie mit diesen handen sprechen kann das habe ich am meisten an ihrer darbietung bewundert ihre sprechenden hande die ihre worte erst vollkommen machten ich freue mich auf die nachste begegnung mit ihr die usa das reiche land haben einen weiteren schatz geschenkt bekommen
awesome and healing enlightenment across the board of humanity
beautiful in every sense of the word how proud americans should feel at this young lady
why would people downvote this smh
wonderful
she makes me proud to be an american
worth a nobel price
if one is worth of a nobel price  shes the one
this is not poetry if poetry is defined as heightened language gormans phrasing is prosaic although she is fond of plays on words (justice and just us arms as armaments and arms reaching out) the last time a poem was read at an inaugural was 30 years ago when maya angelou read at bill clintons and prior to that it was 30 years earlier when robert frost read at jfks i can only conclude that gorman was selected because she wouldnt upstage bidens own speech theres also a lot here that i can only call trolling the conservatives to send the message that the liberals are in charge now and theyre going to have to listen to our concerns
perfect
deep
this is kendrick lamaresk
a powerful message amanda gorman thank you
amen
this woman is superpowerful this is real life life is challenges and twist and turns help all hate none peace
whilst we have our eyes on the future the future has its eyes on us wow thats a powerful  democracy can be delayed but ca never be defeated if that josh hawley cruz and trump have only known that their dishonesty is going to be forever written in the history books
her voice is very similar to that of ilhan omar
the national socialist party of the united states has won
the marxists
trump was like huh
i think i saw someone in the audience crying
if you are not killed by a policeman by 2036 maybe you could run for the american presidential election lol
eeeisshhhh
i am not crying but you are

american circuspreparation for future democrats president
whats with all the dislikes must be jealousy
@lh sd i do think some of the hate has to do with race because a lot of the positive comments have race discussions beneath them although i agree with a lot of what youre saying youre perpetuating it and also creating an incentive for the topic to be about her race rather than her performance see how easy it is regardless people use labels and groups because it makes them feel special and validated to be apart of something especially if thats a victimised group so its not just democrats its everyone this is coming from a trump supporter
you are great nation if you are just  recep tayyip erdoganthe president of republic of turkey
but you are not you are the exporter of rivers of tears and blood destruction where is the smell of oil control and slavery of regions countries and people shame on you arrogant and greedy america
is it really a poetry
these black people talking about white privilege but they cant do that because they can get away with it
amazing poem love from denmark
i see that from kurdistan
speech impediment my ass
time to sent young men to bomb afghanistan and leave their bones there while camala and joe have dinner at the plaza  because why not 
ive got some rhymes about biden
your poem is a hammer falling like a feather straight into our hearts giving us relief awakening from that nightmare of hatred
who is here bc their teachers sent them here | | |
i think her poem is technically quite good aside from my political beliefs i was dreading rupi quar rubbish (not poetry) only thing was the self indulgence was a little too much ebbs of my ego apparent not a lot of metaphorical meaning likely as it was more of a speach which is okay nice timbre/rhyme structure and meter i think she did a decent job
speach
so biden is for blacks unlike trump who properly funded their colleges and was helping them with ben carson work their way out of poverty if you dont vote democrat you aint black  said biden thomas sowell is right about the problems of poverty and the democrats have no policies that work in this regard
@michael lewis but we all won against the ultimate cheater liar and narcissistin chief also your phrase so biden is for blacks sounds so bizarre it smacks of jealousy
@composer guy i wouldnt mind losing fairly but not to a cheat
sore loser
aaaawwww playing the victim card again lol waaayywcist waaaaaaaaaahhh 
im almost 80 years old but hearing this speech i could not keep back my tears
@n in other words you dont believe that experience is the best teacher therefore you should respect that teacher and no speak loosely because you think you superior
@ramanman97 i dont agree with orion but respecting your elders is the dumbest thing ive ever heard its useless too
@whereyouabouts tobe me too it was self servicing bs slam poetry used to be about many different subjects now its all about race and womens rights with their fake outrage all of it had the same cadence and delivery
youre getting soft on us old man this writing was pure trash
hello 
@orionh3000 hey gen z go to hell
orionh3000 play in traffic
@orionh3000 i was smiling at this comment until you showed up
@satwik mishra if you have a problem figuring out whether youre going to vote for me or donald trump then you arent black your president joe biden 
you and me both i am 58 years old and was a great admirer of the great poets one such was the late great maya angelou amanda gorman in her short young life put into words and emotions with her voice tones and inflections everything that was needed and more at just the right moment at this time and place it was all this and powerful but so much more i could never in my life find the appropriate words to show how much i appreciated just hearing her speak this is how her words moved me some people in a million years mr griesang will never ever understand no matter what the circumstances are what it is to be a true human being this means accepting of all and everything also seeing the beauty in all any and everything in this world i will leave it all at that take care my friend your life is just fine and right
@orionh3000 how is watching a video on youtube at whatever age equated to not having a life  whats the difference if hes watching tv or youtube you wouldnt be saying this if he was watching tv the difference is he can watch whatever he wants on youtube so whats ur problem
@reaver red youve had the weirdest comments in this comment section you think youre a super smart one huh already figured life out smh
@orionh3000 lmfaoooooo
@orionh3000 orionh your telling risto to get a life you should get a life talking trash to 80 year olds on the internet means you have no life and those other 9 people who liked his comment your just sad and pathetic trust me you are
@orionh3000 dont u got yo 7 times tables to do
@orionh3000 hey gen z get a life
@orionh3000 did writing a mean youtube comment to a nice 80 year old man make you feel better
@orionh3000 a boomer has had a life he or she can talk about their emotions yes that you had to put your soiled paws on a beautiful post just reveals that you are a basement dweller super mario forever
@hey there you totally missed the point didnt you how about you stick to tiktok
do 80 year olds not cry lol
@orionh3000 bro what the actual fkkk respect your elders idiot did you think that was a funny comment or something
@orionh3000 you cant even read a sentence go cry in the corner with donald dump
@orionh3000 hi gen xy go to hell
how is this a poem it dont rhyme
quiet isnt always peace bruh
what a wonderful young woman  a fantastic speech  a great hope for america  my greatest respect greetings from bavaria  near germany
i cant wait for her to be president
if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy wow
laydown ur weapons and knee to the government who need not to be a justice one
even with such beautiful messages of hope they still only see and hear evil in this intelligent poet how can someone dislike this effort to heal through spoken words of encouragement to the broken and downtrodden people of the land yet they cheered during these last 4 years of vile distasteful political rhetoric hyperbole deceit and murder how refreshing to see classy and inclusive demonstrations again instead of smutty tyranny to those who may hate the fact that your merica is once again progressing towards actually striving to be the united states of america full of liberty and justice for all not just the colonialist that love to pillage and destroy those who appear different such primitive minds if only they paid attention in biology and chemistry it would possibly be apparent that we all have more in common than different i cannot wait until bigotry is extinct
wow theres nothing i can write here that can top the beauty eloquence of that poetry deep sentiment 
same blabber jabber just said differently 
she was amazing as a fellow poeti am proud of herthe words that she spoke were brilliantly expressed from her heart for the whole world to listeni want to share something with everyonei am a poet and a writeri am a first time selfpublished author of a poetry book here is a link to my poetry book wwwamazoncom/thewritehouseedwinhurdle/dp/1432704613 her future is very bright and i wish her all the best
her mouth lip tongue eyes hands all organs recited smoothly brightly and confidently like the glittering pearls
amazing non pareil and deeply touching
go sis
such an inspiration love it
simply brilliant
imagine all the english social study history political science drama teachers in this country making a point to have their highshool middle school and even elementary students watching and studying this poem and performance amanda have just single handedly recuites and coverts a full generation of future voters and electorates for the democrats party the republican party is screwed
im doing that right now 
for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it  if only we are brave enough to be it 
i hope she was arrested for not wearing a mask on federal grounds
you are not lost but surely guided by god in god we trust
beautiful  so powerful and enlightening thank you
she is a goddess
stunning
meh she rehearsed that sat on her porch drinking from a brown paper bag
youre everything thats wrong with america get over yourself
man let me tell you something you have no appreciation for the real things in life maybe you should reflect to see what makes you act this way you should have hope for a better tomorrow
wow to me this summarises the massive shift underway in the us political landscape america is gonna go from donald trump the apologist for altright racists to wwwwokecom crazy really
propoganda
the magical grenade bilaterally glow because patient dfly suspect on a accidental way careless glib textbook
beautiful your words touched my heart  you were spot on i am so touched 
her words were beautiful but because of her overdone gestures and facial expressions it partly loses its power (not for everyone but for me nowadays people love extravagance because otherwise they cant feel it anymore because of an overload of videos speeches news shes a good writer not that good of a speech if you look to rev beamans speech he just tells his speech with confidance without need of overacted gestures
yawn
there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
quiet isnt always peace

thank you amanda your delivery of your poem was amazing may you be blessed this year and the coming years

full lyrics when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in in all of the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it that would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can periodically be delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burden but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
@adam wintetbottom its okay ot happens god bless
@mac gregory tired of people sorry
@adam wintetbottom chill

two things it isnt lyrics as it isnt a song somebody else posted the poem in an easier to read line by line format as it should be read or spoken that said it is a beautiful poem written by and beautifully orated by a talented young lady
this creature make satanic ritual in this hunger game
let your light shine now the evil as been removed by the people  as they saw through the hatred of the minority
shes talking to a bunch of damn demons sitting up theresmfh
even the vice president pence ok 
poor thang her nose started to run at towards the end but she delivered well

beautiful 
the power of words 
the material macrame oceanographically guess because canvas ironically moor below a substantial wing lively apathetic turn
zero reason to dislike this bots or racists we have overcome your hate racism and chosen ignorance
she took it from trump  lets make america great
what is the flag that is flying below the american flag
the national league of families pow/mia flag pow means prisoner of war and mia means missing in action it was created after the vietnam war in 1972 i think
yay biden i just made the worst dub subscribe if you hate it and listen to juscuz and volaeo on spotify
this young woman understands the intent of our constitutions framers better than half our elected representatives holding office today
damn she got bars
she blew up over night as inshe is a overnight success such a beautiful talented young woman
@reaver red you are right lol i put it back
@reaver red blow up as in she is the most popular person right nowan over night success but i see what you mean given what happened on jan 6th just so sad i will reword it thanks also my original post received 48 liks so far i believe people knew exactly what i meant  meaning her overnight success
@reaver red this comment
horrible
@moonquartz  because someones poem sucks ass damn
racist
lol trash
@moonquartz what are you gonna do about it
racist
amanda german is so good at words
voice
i wonder why biden didnt sniff her hair 1 word shitlocks
beside having a well written poem to share and recite the young lady had a very good and passionate presentation she resonates confidence intelligence love and respect of country and fellowmen bravo indeed
~~ amanda is a phenomenal young lady who wrote delivered a phenomenal poem for joe bidens inauguration blessings to her 
this poem and performance will live on for all time  will be talked about studied recited framed and loved exceptional and beautiful
inspirational i didnt see inauguration but she has great insight
    bravo
i came here because i am compelled to say that this is some of the most brilliant perfect spoken word poetry i have ever been privileged to witness this exceptionally gifted intelligent young womans oratory skills are on par with every single public speaker that has ever lived her compelling presence and utter confidence her hands moving gracefully as they frame her powerful ideasone is compelled to hang on every word and the meaning behind them i had no hope for the education of the lost covid generation left behind by the atrociously weak attempt labeled distance learning this beautiful brilliant eloquent young lady has single handedly restored that hope  i predict that this old soul/young woman is about to embark on a shining streaking career arc over us alland we are all better for her presence in the world preach it little sister never be silenced and thank you 
as a kid when we entered elocution contests i recall us reciting mark antony  martin luther king john kennedys speeches im sure this will be part of the repertoire for todays kids
she sounds like a narcisist lol dramatic
the preachiness 
stfu you just called half the country racists for the last 4 years now you asking for unity haha gtfoh
neat poem i liked it nice delivery to
well said and spoken buy not much rhymed no one clicked but i really love the passion well done
i appreciate the sentiments but i dont find the delivery particularly poetic
amanda is such a force of light everything about this poem is high vibrational the beauty and painful truth in this speech is so powerful children for years to come will study this poem
the americans should unite and fight the evil ccp together not just focusing on these shallow leftist rituals which serve no practical effects to this country
wow this girl
and of course nothing she said relates to what will now happen or has happened
i think she should be hired as speech writer its a long way to a possible president run in 2036 but its a good start for her 
maya would be so proud 
cringe
shes actually casting a spell
she stole the show an unexpected delight so inspiring
people like her are needed to restore calm so carry on and show us all the lesson waiting to be learned

black girl reading a poemblack vice president but still blacks still cry and whine never stop complaining about how racist this country is 
@lovely people she is a talented angel who is definitely showing off her ancestry coming from a line of kings queens emperors chiefs and pharaohs standing out like no other
@martin martins you are really behind on black history regarding those who have stood out and accomplished so much whether they are presidents vice presidents government officials doctors politicians professors attorneys inventors scientists entreprenuers etc a few individuals really lol and yes african americans may not have had the headstart like white americans had at first where their ancestors were bullied and helped build this country but things do change and african americans are making progress it is 2021 not the 1600s on another note all human beings emerged and originated from africa further kamala harris has always embraced her black and asian heritage (jamiacan and indian) do your research she has always been introduced as black and south asian so you may want to read up on history to figure out what that means
@lovely people pointing out a few individuals who have been pushed into the spotlight does not signify the emergence of your false utopia i thought kamala was the first indian senate member some years ago interesting that her ethnicity changes depending on what narrative is being told youre literally just pointing out situations in which people are obtaining positions based solely on ethnicity and no other merit good job and most of bidens team are juice so diverse
@martin martins sweetie it already has landed feast your eyes on exhibit a this video she is an overnight success and in such a positive light and there are plenty more amanda gormans coming lol nice try though you do know we have a half black/asian vp right oh by the way have you taken a peek at bidens cabinet picks cuture is changing dude get used to it i will be voting for ms gorman when she runs
@lovely peoplelmao im sorry to tell you but the goofy fantasy land you described will never exist and you realize the people storming the capitol were not the youth right the leftoids burning cities all year were much younger than the capitol folks you have failed at turning that one around lol nice try though also keep repeating that objectively untrue younger and wiser generation nonsense is humorous
@martin martins sorry to tell you honey there are loads of amanda gormans walking around (talented beyond some peoples comprehension) coming in all races and walks of life these people are the younger wiser generation that will make a great difference to this country who knows their god given purpose another example young and changed for the better republicans will be joining young and stronger democrats to lead this country to an even better usa for all *now as far as the others you are describing unfornately yes there will be the small percentage of youth following in their mentors foot steps who feel that storming the capital and attacking people is the only way to get their sick way*
@lovely people mostly young people yes the hilariously indoctrinated youth the ones eating tide pods and unable to decide which bathroom to use while suffering from depression and other mental illness in increasingly high numbers god is certainly not happy with todays young people and the continue degeneration of modern society lol sorry to tell you honey but there being millions of woke social justice goombas walking around is nothing to be proud of
@martin martins hmmmi guess you did not see the millions of people peacefully protesting globally made up of every kind of race and background imaginable standing up for justice and equality for all they were mostly young people you know get to know god the truth will set you free honey hate is a terrible thing that poisons the soul and ends up going nowhere but down
@chris farley no everyone should see skin color but be wise enough to look at the person within god said so because we are all made in his image again the racist will simply gradually disappear  instinct  as our younger generation takes over who in fact are much wiser than the older generation
@lovely people lmao that paragraph could not be further from the truth
@chris farley people are here to stay get used to it or get left behind this is the united states of american one nation under god with liberty and justice for all the people are with biden and harris and so is god where he does not discriminate this was a character election now there is a black and asian vice president who happens to be a woman where this party received the most votes in us history they are for all states blue and red where people will love live and work together towards prosperity and success  the way god intended from the beginning of time younger generation is much wiser than the older generation and dont be surprised when one day there will only be brown people in this world the racisit will simply gradually disappear  instinct
@ucjdiymotrr75g2huv1rwsiw good then maybe you can stop whining and crying and using skin color for your short comings
then move stop complaining and just leave do us all a favor 
very racist yes
this country is still racist
damn her line of wanting to be a president is golden reminds me of my dream to hold office but i was born to immigrant parentsthe moment i realized the constitution discriminates against me lol

magnificent glorious authentic afroamerican
lovely   poetrey
she gave me chills  what a poem 
#davesplay on words
the hill we climb when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade we braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gaze not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation become the future our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid the new dawn balloons as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
wow the brightest poem i have ever heard wow you are amazing stay blessed darling
the united state(s) of humanity america is in a state of deep scrutiny so is humanity todays america presents the future state of humanity if the world advances the way america is advancing we will end up being divided between two blocs that hate each other in every senseideologically approach to life culture education and every other way it will be impossible to connect the adversaries just as it is impossible to connect the democrats with the republicans in todays divided united states as things are there will be no calm it seems as though things have gone out of control but they havent it is simply what happens when the ego wants to govern and will not hear of anything less than that it does not want connection it wants domination it may be horrifying to watch but we are merely witnessing the natural process when everything revolves around who has more and who has less and when the ego keeps intensifying we come to a state where the ego wants everything and to leave absolutely nothing to the other side this is what you get when you dont educate people it doesnt matter how much you invest in aid packages and relief programs when the ego comes to a state of all or nothing nothing helps therefore we should thank america for the example it is giving us at its own expense we should thank the american people for setting an example that demonstrates what our future will be like unless we achieve unity among us in other words if we dont achieve a united state in humanity humanity will become like todays united states an assortment of nations colors races and faiths that hate each other to death and do everything they can to cater to their hatred
okay
wow
how beautiful
usa a country bruised butthole   
we know to put our future first but first we must put our differences aside
yeah i got a difference for you right here all i do is win and all you do is lose
@nepthu as a european i dont care which party rules the usa sure i have  like every human being  my preferences but i cannot judge which president or which party does better for most of the people ( i say most because there will never be a party or a politician which makes the whole country happy) so my call was not for or against a certain party we just see over here what happens over there in your country and i am really scared when i read all the hatred comments at each other here everyone blames everyone and it begins  or ends  with tirades of hate against each other here or other social media channels so my call  or plead  was ( including myself) to see and listen overall respect other people  independent of their opinion believe and so on if each of us can not put aside hate and disrespect and have no will to be more tolerant  how can we expect it from other people from politicians from countries to keep peace
@dalangie i agree with you but my fear is how democrats treat opposition anyone who voted trump is demonized their version of peace means silence to assimilation into their collective hive mind will their calls for peace include compromise on their end no one ever asks this
@john muscles differences will never be put aside as long as peace is not even possible between two persons and people hate each other because of different opinions lets start right in our own heart how we see and treat other people lots of love from some foreigner in europe
wow the irony great speech though just too bad you said it durring the wrong inauguration
shes very good at spewing mainstream media propaganda ill give her that
shes only up there because shes black
@travis green she represents the ghetto and she hates white people so why biden would get a racist little black girl up there is beyond me
and
weve braved the belly of the beast i felt that the only way is up for there
thats been said many many times sadly it offers no hope though
i missed those workhouses
@s rightsure is
nope the beast is on his way youll see
what
dr biden lmao she has a doctorate in education not medicine hahahaha that title is just for show
did your education ever get you there
its still doctor you idiot thats the title
omg they banned dislikes on all of biden inauguration videos america is going crazy
every english teacher in the usa  who inspired
brilliant 
liars thieves tyrants the ppl theyve brainwashed condolences america
first illegal pos potus
alllllll nations come from a queen #nubianqueen 
feces
glory to god bow to your queen bow to your mother 
such a beautiful poem
she is going places
1 john 514 god always hears this is the confidence we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us the apostle john one of the disciples who was closest to jesus shares this advice with the early church it speaks of us having confidence when we pray that god hears us it also brings in the principle of being close enough to god to know his will so we will be able to know when we ask for things whether they line up with gods purposes for our lives and his kingdom
miss gorman had a speech impediment as a younger child and took to writing her words on paper to express herself later she realized her words needed to to be brought to life and gathered the courage to speak her words learning to overcome her speech impediment and that is what brought her to where she stood yesterday a brave and so eloquent young woman who is planning to run for president in 2036 even if she doesnt reach that lofty goal i admire her for having a plan and working towards it she is beautiful she is america
@zolar czakl only if the players arent kneeling jk enjoy
@robert glad you liked it im out enjoy your evening super bowl coming up no politics just enjoy it if you watch it
@zolar czakl good one
@robert youre the one throwing shade typical trumper your guy lost get over it
@zolar czakl typical democrat
@robert stick with dr seuss
reaver red play in traffic your on the wrong side of yt amanda gorman is amazing
@be seeing you so shes a harvard graduate and all you can say is she was chosen for her colour noted
@be seeing you coming from a guy who voted for the orangehued guy
https//wwwyoutubecom/channel/ucymftdetwaare9wytt2hmw/videos
@la tasha michelle the people throwing shade at my merely positive post and praise of this fine young lady are (im assuming) mostly white males how would this scenario play out these same white males wake up one day and find their skin and facial appearances have become black they still have their white privilege sentiments but they are suddenly black in appearance when they get pulled over by a police officer and treated in ways they never have before  perhaps gun drawn on them  and harassed how quickly will the words this isnt fair fall from their lips when theyre in a department store and notice theyre being watched much more closely and wonder what thats all about will they again say this isnt fair im just browsing when they notice that people they actually know but who wont recognize them because their appearance is completely different and black and notice that they are being disrespected by them perhaps having the n word thrown at them will they have the same respect for their friends if in a few days they wake again white and all the same as before will they have better appreciation for the struggles black people face solely because of the color of their skin or will they just go on leaving negative comments just like before walk a mile in someone elses shoes see the world from someone elses eyes and viewpoint
@be seeing you hahahahahaha stay mad fam
@zolar czakl i noticed the hate too glad theres some love from a few who see the beauty in the speech and the message
i would wholly support her in 2036 she has much to learn but i have 0 doubt an eloquent woman as herself would in
@be seeing you these morons eat this garbage right up she could have been up there shi**ing on the microphone and these losers would still be pushing this hurrrruurr duurrrrrr shes so so great im crying omg and shes a poc urrrrr
@paris donohoe if george floyd and blm hadnt happened in 2020 she wouldnt be standing there  fact
@la tasha michelle i always try to be honest and i had trouble understanding her her delivery was poor and the words were banal i mean shes good for her age certainly but i would have preferred a more accomplished poet to present a more meaningful message in a more sophisticated manner true power does not come from using big words and fancy gesticulations it comes from the power to impact people in a meaningful way i think she impacted people in a superficial way
@robert i always look at the positive #1 the wording was excellent and pronunciation was exquisite #2 the message was profound #3 it was positive #4 she was poised with power
@be seeing you nope but i did get stimulated 
@big l another sheep had your covid vaccine yet
@be seeing you who cares at least she had the opportunity and now i know of her  nobody knows you 
this is a result of george ffloyd and blm nothing more nothing less what was the selection process we will never know
like the world needs anymore poets
@menche mendoza you can ask but there is none 
@la tasha michelle didnt really find the poem moving to be honest she used banal phrases like belly of the beast and just because it just is doesnt mean there isnt justice i mean i definitely couldnt do what she did at her age but lets not pretend her poem was great because it wasnt
amanda such an elegant powerhouse whose words move mountains thank you for carrying the torch so eloquently
@kaylah r black or white both have equal opportunities in this day and age its poisonous groups like blm that create racial tension that wasnt there in the first place george floyd was he perfect example far more caucasian people died/ die in police custody its people like you pandering to them that give them more of a platform im sick to the back teeth of hearing about it
@be seeing you are you saying black people is more prevlieged than white people or should the fbi be searvhing for you who was at the capital storming congress
@zolar czakl we must never be afraid to speak our true and honest voice even if it is at the expense of criticism from others that said her wish to run for president at the age of 22 is great but that shouldnt somehow be a platform for her message she has zero credentials literally shes a poet for crying out loud and i stand by my assessment of her poem it sounds grand but in reality it is lacking in substance it is suspect to me also that they decided to choose an attractive young black female to give this opportunity ( a group that is seemingly infallible and immune to criticism) hispanics and asians deserve representation too but of course that doesnt fit the democrats narrative its all about black this black that its a bit too much imo
@menche mendoza the message is centered around the racial/cultural/political divide we have in this country basically the poem expresses her feelings on where we are and what we could become if we work together towards that goal
@be seeing you id rather have someone that cant tie his shoelaces than someone who cant tell the truth
original poster here i put up a positive comment about the accomplishments of this young lady never put any negative vibes out there concerning political figures merely mentioned the fact that she plans to run for president her idea not mine very many of the reply posts are filled with hate for some reason just a suggestion smile at a stranger that person may smile back you may feel better have a nice day everybody
@robert nothing ventured nothing gained
who does she think she is running for president its kinda unrealistic
@be seeing you youre deluded its crazy how you think you arent the only one who looks ignorant here
@be seeing you all these biden haters love trump usually so thats pretty interesting its called biased buddy you dont know any thing about biden besides what you want to listen too
@reaver red youre aware there were only 30 set jobs on that pipe right and it was actually taking more jobs away by being built  right
@be seeing you thats rude and youre an example of the problem
@patricia x are you that sad that you need to scrutinise someones grammar have you never been a victim of autocorrect on your phone or have you just always been a victim of life 
@be seeing you just an fyi  and of story is end of story learn more educate yourselfand you may not be so contrary to overly simplistic thinking nobody picked her just for skin color im white btw
@menche mendoza did i ever mention importance you interpret the words for how it makes you feel thats poetry
@tb wms  biden cant tie his own shoelaces and hes now running the country 
@be seeing you biden is not racist you are taking whatever he may have said in the past out of context biden has said that he was raised to believe that he was no better than anyone else all white people were not raised that way and more importantly i believe biden is authentic i truly believe he wants to tackle the problems we currently have in this country and try to make life better for everyone i really hope he succeeds
@be seeing you you dont think they would choose a pasty new englander with red hair who has a lisp
@reaver red she was used for such a time like this where death is lurking all around spiritually and natural and because she had a message of hope for those that are stuck on yesterdays hate and she was used because shes wise and intelligent for her age and for her message 
@tb wms  biden is the most racist president you lot have ever had have you not read some of his historical quotes surrounding the black community or are you gonna put that down to his obvious case of early onset dementia
@be seeing you im sure he wanted the participants to be diverse if you dont know her accomplishments you need to do some research please dont allow jealousy or hatred to cloud your thinking
@be seeing you you meant end of story
@tb wms black privelidge is what it was  fact thousands of harvard grads out there would be interesting to know the selection process
@be seeing you she was picked as a stunning gem what beauty inside and out stunning stopped me in my tracks what a graceful beauty truly unique
@be seeing you maybe so but the girl is a harvard graduate and extremely talented no one else could have done a better job
she was picked for her skin colour and of story 
you are not accepted by the others american sis lets move to africa
charming personality
beautiful and very inspirational
she nailed this
go fix africa hypocrite
@n0gam oh it is words can be hurtful but never raciestdope
@pedro dynamite thats like saying words cant be hurtful
@n0gam words cant be raciest
careful racism is showing
@ sighting a poem saying her people would make america better is africa better
@pedro dynamite shes a poet activist not a politician
@ well what can she do for america
@pedro dynamite did she say she was born in africa even if that were the case what could she do to fix a whole country
@ i mean if she is african before american
what are you on about
perhaps you should go fix mexico pedro )
not impressedin fact i noticed several contradictions
only those that seek the truth can hear it
https//youtube/of3ypx8kgi
the great irony of this moment is that if joe biden were working for starbucks what he used to say about race would get him fired but now hes useful because he is dependent on blacks
incredible well delivered loved it
brilliant sounds like a young maya angelou
i need to take a few pages from her bookor maybe the whole damn thing im awe struck she has a beautiful and powerful voice too wise beyond her age
thank you we still have hope listening to you
powerful beautiful talented words and young lady 
stunning poem
she has the same movement of words as martin luther king
bunch of bs lies
amazing
she delivered it with full confidence i love it 
here are her words when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promised glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it

a wonderful poem by a beautiful young woman with a beautiful heart

@reaver red no i shouldve clarified we love the references d
@jerrell3451 no i love it personally xd

hamilton quotes right there
your not even black creepy joe biden
she has sown a seed lets water it and watch it grow
epic

one day i will truly appreciate this
oh wow shes black  thats really good
this is beautiful
this is not a literary movement but only rigor mortis
would have never seen her at trumps inauguration
obviouslyn
the final stanza brought tears to my eyes so much hope so much conviction in being our best version of america
if you gave this beautiful young black woman a thumbs downits something seriously wrong with your mentaland your prejudice is definitely showing
you literally voted for a racist
repurify recover  let it begin 
biden is the president of the corporation(null and void) the usa became a republic on 4th july 2020 the best is yet to come
the only part of the inauguration worths watching
she maybe talks typical stupid bs speech but have to admit this woman looks amazing her outfit face hairstyle color combination
lovely inspiring young lady absolutely wonderful poem just what the country needs to hear
blahhhhhhhhhh
what a brave intelligent woman
cool identity politics pandering to the naive telling them they are victims obama 20 she sure would make a great politician alrite lots of empty words with a crooked smile attempting to talk ever so eloquently off a piece of paper
lol
she just made my list of inspiring people she is the future of the untied states
she brought tears to these old and cynical eyes wonderful she almost made me want to be american again
@reaver red i am calm im asking a relevant question if he didnt enjoy it why is he under this video better yet this comment the main comment is so positive why not take your negativity somewhere else
@orionh3000 so why are you here go cry somewhere else
amanda gorman what a bright and beautiful angel you are guiding us with your bright light through these times of darkness may our lord always guide you and help you achieve your goals
wow  where do ya start incredible words and delivery kudos to amanda  what a bright future awaits her
im surprised bidden didint touch her or smell her hair or whisper creepy things in here ear
this poem was the best part of the entire inauguration i think that this young woman amanda and her epic poem  should be placed in our history books this poem she reads is history made today 1/20/21 god bless america  amen god bless us all amen 
someone put me out of my misery  just shoot me nowwill this poem ever end 
the utopian ellipse phytochemically discover because capricorn temporarily scold despite a truculent pamphlet hanging dispensable yugoslavian
ew
the delirious cappelletti puzzlingly release because dogsled mechanically unpack on a receptive author foregoing obnoxious radiator
thats the biggest childrens head band ive ever seen does it make her feel good to use big words that dont fit into context blah blah blah 15 words could have said this much mouth context get to the point  gah leeee
i feel sorry for her clearly no one ever filled her in about joes past stances and remarks regarding black people
@kevin johnson the muslim ban has been cancelled thankfully to biden
@kevin johnson there was a whole fiasco happening the first yeartrump was president when he tried building a wall that in return separated families from their children
@kevin johnson they both have spoken openly what they feel out of your heart you speak stuff verbally so if you are saying one person (trump ) is non racist would be a lie
@kevin johnson couple quotes from trump you probably dismissed i have black guys counting my money  i hate it
@kezia kandii letting blacks integrate would create a racial jungle and now tell me exactly what trump said that is racist please tell me
same with trumpthe pancake is burnt both sides
its all downhill from here
wow just wow such brilliance  brava young lady molto bravo
wow what could you even say to the power of that
absolutely beautiful
wow 22 years with more wisdom and voice than ive seen in those with 3x her years gives me hope for our country grateful for that moment yesterday and that it was a message hear round the world
nbc is the worst i cant watch the freaking news without knowing what party the people are in
empty hype these words barely mean nothing platitudes anyone seeing more in this is trying too hard
cringe
super cringe at the fact its a racist she is supporting
how youre suppose to hear the speech no one forced to look at it
i hope the 25000 troops that were protecting joe xiden from americans appreciated the poem
im watching from singapore im so lifted from this beautiful beautiful poem thank you for the experience
wonder why anyone would give a thumbs down  beautifully delivered and so needed after the hate lies divisiveness from 45 life seems so much quieter without the constant tweets and lies what will happen to my late night comedy where i go to for some small slice of humor  during delusional 45 tenure
 
president donald j trump is #1 hon
@xavier well hooray for biden / harris gas is on its way up in 2 days time hes gotten rid of over 100000 jobs  yay for dems their poet lauriets too

beautiful hallelujah when these things begin to take place stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing near look at the fig tree and all the trees 30 when they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near 31 even so when you see these things happening you know that the kingdom of god is near
a fraudulent president with a paid crowd disgusting we went back donald trump
imagine creating a dumb narrative to make yourself think youre right
ms gorman is just awesome   i love her god bless you pamela finney st charles missouri i will buy your book
 that was amazing
as a non american i admit this was very beautiful and inspiring god bless your country if there are any poetry lovers out there i do interpreations on my channel check them out if youd like )
to be so young and yet so poised and eloquent in front of such an audience wow shes an extraordinary young woman
lauryn hill vibes
wow another black face how surprising
we lost the light today communism is evil
if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it amanda you are a leader and i pray that you inspire future generations to be leaders just like you
think on the words when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it the day comes  day is light and to have shade there must be light  right meaning of shade 1 comparative darkness and coolness caused by shelter from direct sunlight sitting in the shade synonyms shadow shadiness shadows coolness cool  light glare 2 a color especially with regard to how light or dark it is or as distinguished from one nearly like it question what if she used it as the slang terminology shade (slang) shade is a popular slang term that means disrespect the term commonly appears as throwing shade which is similar to saying disrespecting or dissing the term is used to describe when a person disrespects another person which is also known as talking trash about a person the disrespect comes from the laws created by biden and others before him  including trump the disrespect comes at the vary skin color she has  to enrich all others above you so far biden has done so much for everyone eles except the black people that actually voted to get him in office oh yeah  he increased snap  nope  more classified white people are on the food stamp program than blacks more blacks are essential workers biden and harris (is the granddaughter of a white man  a plantation owner and a black female her mother was from the white class in india that hated the darker skin lower class of people) have a large hatred for the black communities  listen to their speeches and to their actions biden always screams he wants to help the black communities with 1 lowincome housing 2 more social benefits 3 more project housing 4 more private prison system programs nothing about  self employment 2 home ownership 3 improve school system 4 remove the crime bill war on drugs and 3strick law 5 punish banks/lenders for redlining and highinterest rates on black people 6 remove the unjust judges lawyers and police with criminal actions against them 7 rebuild and repay the black owners of all the businesses stolen under war on drugs and white supremacy such as black wallstreet and others for a start where in america has this been for the black people what new dawn  with the crime bill and other laws still in full force against the black communities they targeted for the purpose of white wealth and gains what people are being disrespected what nation of 4fathers 1st realized a revolution  that was not for black people that is for sure  during that time these same 4fathers were creating laws to maintain black people as animal
wow she amazing if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it 
she might actually just become president one day
pseudointellectual pretentious melodramatic meaningless drivel
its a shame that this speech was used to celebrate the election of such a phoney and fraudulent election as that of the super phoney joe biden
this woman is the young lady mlk
actually that would be tamika mallory
god bless america god bless the world
okay great but did she have to mention lebron i mean his ego is big enough as it is
amazing beautiful insightful and powerful ) really truly inspiring
all you thumbs down people are truly deplorable
her words and presence are so beautiful and so graceful shes like a beacon of hope for the future
she oughta be a rapper
its the accent and intelligence for me
in other words for you it was the outfit and the social media exposure not the message 
@jack frisxo exactly my question man
i dont think he/she would reply lol

phenomenal it was like maye angelo was speaking straight through her
ladies and gentlemen youre next and future president of these united states
i am beyond captivated by hershe is truly destined for greatness
my eyes weep from the strength and truth she portrays
quiet isnt always peace
@inalouise benzo yes i noticed that too its too deep for some so i just let it go some people arent able to get outside of themselves its sad
@jane em oh no i wasnt talking about you i was talking about the people in the comments referring to their experiences with quiet being peace in way that sort of contradicts what you said
@inalouise benzo i get it thats why i wrote it down heh
so you guys completely missed her point got it quiet is most often associated with peacethats why she said it isnt always that
@hahn k f quiet isnt always peace sometimes it is
@hahn k f talking about external quiet or internal
quiet can often be the most dangerous sometimes and sometimes speak up can bring peace  security can sometimes be insecurity read to learn not just to understand
@reaver red the 11000 jobs you think were lost were just contractors who arent out of work forever they lost one job that would have lasted about 2 weeks
nothing exemplified that more than the media silence during obamas presidency the same silence youre going to get now
quiet is always peace tho thats the definition of peace if anything speaking out would make things temporarily less peaceful
im sorry sweety but i myself am afraid what my anger does so i just stay quiet so i dont land in jail because of some jerks
yes when things get a little too quiet you should be attuned to trouble i myself search for a little peace and quiet where peace and quiet are one and the same thing
let not our blender becomes their burden
our blunders become their burdens
trump runs for congress in florida 2022 then president 2024 dem worst nightmare
@betty boop it was a private company anyways all hail ingsoc
@betty boop and social media isnt a right its a privilege he doesnt need twitter or anything like that so yes i am celebrating censorship because it was right
@betty boop yes im the fascist pig 
@n0gam fascist pig i guess you celebrate censorship
how will anyone even know about him hes banned from almost all social medias 
a black queen at work
yay  wakanda forever 
keep going girl yes
beautiful
disgusting
54k people dislike this video 54k people are too ignorant to understand it
blah blah blah hes not a legitimate president ok donald trump was the one who won the election wake up
prove it
garbage demoncrats are coming for your rights protected by our constitution wwg1wga
i love her   
thank you amanda and no i am not an american but you dont need to be to understand what she is saying this is the most powerful poemi have ever heard
maya angelo passed that torch bring it home baby girl bring it home
finally democracy is   biden  
she quoted the bible and george washington im crying
im not bahahahaha
@davedaddy101 get over yourself
george washington and jesus would both hate joe biden he is a false king who stole an election
omg get a grip do you need a tissue puke
so ready for this new chapter of presidency
poor kids are just as smart as white kids
the haters had to come and dislike this thank god no hate can stop the brilliance of this
such a beautiful brave poem may god continue to bless and use you amanda as you continue to pave the way for future generations
the highlight of a special day in our countries history amandas powerful words sum up beautifully where weve been as a country and where we are headed
this is the daughter of my grade 6 english teacher lol
omg thats so cool
@how to properly clean your plastic computer he cant be your dad because im your dad
yeah and joe biden is my dad
angelina vargas its yours
@hahn k f what about it
my ass
isnt that great im so proud
repukes only get riled up with racist insults and wwf carnival barker funny voices as they gobble up a bunch of fake hollow promises they cant handle anything like this
she spoke with a tremendous amount of power and conviction in her voice she wanted to send this message to as many people as she could and i can say with confidence  we heard it simply beautiful and makes me proud to be american in such a trying time
just as i did with obama i hope biden fails #maga
thank you amanda brilliant
for a moment america stood still
 
most definitely todays maya angelou her ring on her right hand is from oprah it is a symbol of maya angelous booki know why the caged bird sings fyi
i agree with the sentiment but isnt this kinda overrated words like the light came across as vague especially when you consider this is biden we talking about not the most progressive person on the map i agree with the paris agreement tho
the young maya angelo shine on girl
god giving talent 
contrast the intelligence beauty and eloquence of this amazing young lady with the ignorance ugliness and stupidity of the mob that descended on the capitol on january 6 what a difference 2 weeks makes
beauty
nah ill take the mob at least they were exciting
wunderdoggy that is no where near breaching the capitol it hasnt been breached since the 1800s
@destined2win right you seem like a pretty nice if somewhat selfrighteous person frankly i dont care for your beliefs and youre definitely severely misinformed on many fronts but its your country not mine do what you will with it
@jade lin lee chen look man i dont agree with what your saying at all but i would die for your right to say it
@jade lin lee chen bruh you act like they killed people or burned the capitol down  it was because of the obviously fraudulent election and ye i misspoke about the zuckerberg i meant jack dorsey but it dont matter cuz zuckerberg banned bible verses on facebook too
@destined2win the attack on the capitol was an act aimed at oppressing democracy and oppressing voters also zuckerberg didnt ban trump from twitter lmao
@jade lin lee chen how do trump supporters oppress others when they are the side of free speech mark zuckerberg is a known democrat who banned trump from twitter banned bible verses banned conservatives banned any reference to being christian how is that not oppression
@jade lin lee chen antifa destroyed things and killed people because they didnt like other peoples opinions they were not fighting for the right to live
@destined2win what part did you not understand right to live or oppress others or do they sound the same to you
@wunderdoggy so a contested election should _always_ be examined wasnt the 2016 election pretty contested yet it wasnt examined and i wonder why oh wait it was because hillary clinton actually accepted defeat the 2020 election _has_ been examined georgia alone has recounted all ballots _thrice_ trump has had multiple investigators look into it and raised multiple lawsuits and _no election fraud_ was found what more examination do you want also the nerve of you to say blm is being racist against white people i havent seen blm enslaving and lynching white people but i guess advocating for black people to not be brutalized = advocating for white supremacy huh
@jade lin lee chen so antifa dont club people in the head set fires scream to silence others blm wasnt race based only advocating black matters(racist) just like the kkk advocating white mattersif an election is contested like so so so many in the history of democracy and other political philosophies it should be examined and open to interrogaion by a noninterested third party and not the incumbants
@jade lin lee chen that doesnt even begin to make sense 
@wunderdoggy blm and antifa protested for their right to live trump supporters and neonazis protested for their right to oppress others
@joe stupid  to compare the underlying goals of protests about injustice that have become violent at their edges to an antidemocratic uprising fueled by lies and conspiracy theories is to ignore history and the truth ali velshi https//wwwmsnbccom/opinion/comparingblmmarchescapitolriotsignoreshistorytruthn1254596
contrast with the profound ignorance of the democratic party what did they do to serve the people over the past four years (without mentioning trump)
yes antifa and blm were horrible also the rioters in portland seattle minneapolisremember
and the mobs that burnt and rioted all summer long 
@master ninja guessing youre a brainwashed trump supporter so thats rich
more brainwashed television watchers talking like they know something
jan 6th
very powerful words exceptionally talented sisterhad me in tears  
brainwash
man her skin is shiny wtf how much water she drinking
all of it
her words carry no meaning when one side wants to silence the other
had to come back today to hear this again will probably be back tomrorow and the next day and the next day and
absolutely beautiful
what a brilliant young woman thank you amanda for such moving words god continue to bless you  please continue this path
amazing 
simply the best
this is probably the best thing i have ever heard 
this is *chefs kiss*
just beautiful
gotta throw that single mother in there
the black girl made magic 
damn this young lady was good the words the articulation the hand gestures facial expressionsshe was into it and made me get into it i had to come here and listen to it again excellent presentation of a poem by a gifted young lady
perversion of words
you know what it becomes a black thing i get tired of hearing everyone jumped on the bandwagon this is just ridiculous
she just did that and she did it with truth eloquence and grace
she makes as much sense as biden
do not be deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man sows that he will also reap for he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption but he who sows to the spirit will of the spirit reap everlasting life galatians 678 nkjv (https//wwwcrosswayorg/articles/whatisthegospel2/) (https//bibleorg/article/godsplansalvation)
i love this lady so much
unnecessary pretentious drivel but shes black so i guess that makes her and her poem special
you could do better
@ikenna smash thanks mmm smell that air
affirmative action at its finest also congrats on winning *the* lottery
row row row your boat the democrats stole the vote they think that they won that ant so son when you cheat you cant gloat the democrats have stopped the microscope from looking at the votes they hope in a few months or a year we will discover what you fear your treason will earn you a rope
puppet
this poem is trash bring back maya angelou
boring when does the military drag biden out of the oval office by his hair
quite possibly the most beautiful words i have ever witnessed being spoken i hope these words will be remembered taught and spoken long after we all have died
i hope she keeps soaring x absolute treasure 
i think we will hear from this young lady a lot more young people like her are giving hope she represents the future a future how it should bewish her good luck and success
fantastic just fantastic
brilliant brave bold beautiful black an american
that young woman hit it out of the park
did she study at moscow high
we would do well to engrave these beautiful words into the entrance of the congress chambers
yup
awesome young lady this is the best of america
just beautiful and well done
as i listened to amanda gorman poem it stuck in my spirit about being a light and this is my humble response i am the light because the holy spirit lives inside she woke up the poet that lies dormant but it never dies jesus said that we are that light a city on a hill but we can only be that light if we do the masters will we shine in all weather and even rain we shine through our happiness and our pain you remember that god spoke and said let there be light and it was not comprehended by the darkness of night he hung sun moon and stars to guide us along the way who have you led today have you said a kind word or given someone hope what words of encouragement have you spoke do you realize that you cant see a shadow without light help us jesus retore our sight the world is pleading for us to turn up our wattage if you understand the urgency then my friend youve got it you understand that jesus is the only way to the promise land he died so that we could live he sent his spirit to reside so we could give give a helping hand to those who are in need be a bandage to those who bleed people are hurting and stumbling in the dark give them light even if its just a spark a spark can start a flame shine shine shine on in jesus name because like the great poet said its not enough to see the light if you dont become the light machel parks 1/21/2021
wakanda forever
nah study chaucer and shakespeare b intelligent not stalinist brainwashed
thank you ms gorman
speaking to the people of deception
theres always light if were brave enough to see it damnnn
amanda that is beautiful and others read her poem in this place (an american lyric) which is so moving i cannot read out loud as it makes me verklempt
she shined brighter than the sun i love hearing her speak
color therapy and marketing works its been proven i love yellow
@s955us84 youre just not happy for succeeding people )
you are easily impressed
these words will forever be etched in my mind i have seen her speech so many times and it touches me each and every time she was powerful and on point and remarkable
her speech gave me goosebumps it was amazing
great job to amanda an inspiration to alleven my 83 year old grandmother
jesus is lord 
thanks i missed this part you may like our song ways out by foxzen https//youtube/bk_7hrq49r8
god im in tears can you imagine 45 ever authorising this
sometimes if you listen very carefully you can hear the lyrical genius of this woman
the holy word of god  the bible john 3  16  21 _16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god19 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil20 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god_
light in this never ending shade  shade is something positive so not sure if this really works darkness or night would have been better instead
just more leftist propoganda to divide and conquer white man bad racism towards white people is still racism
haha that sucked
the hill we climb when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
the lyrics guy
@jerry i read it over and over again its a shame if you didnt
the way she rhymes is absolutely incredible
thank for sharing amazing she is visionary i think
*quietly singing songs from hamilton in the corner *
thank you 
@jerry i read the whole poembeautiful
bro no one is reading that
a very bright extremely talented and amazing young ladybeautiful inside and out i am so proud of her
thanks 
thank you for sharing
you have inspired me to go back into writing again thank you amanda i am going to purchase your book to support you i hope and pray that one day you will be the next president love  you

thank you for that
we will rise amazing poem i love hearing intelligence again on a consistent basis
people have forgotten that biden was for school segregation back in the 1970s wealthy rich white male didnt want his kids going to school with black kids biden also passed the 1990 crime bill that resulted in mass incarceration of petty crimes that destroyed the black communities the same guy that called well known kkk clan members friends how quickly america has forgotten but hey you aint black unless you voted for biden what a hypocrite
@jewel m that would be no different than supporting those criminals all during 2020 vandalizing property businesses and rioting i support protesting but not destroying our cities
@jewel m he had 40 plus years in government to do good and make a change i can not show support to someone that i do not agree with pray for him sure support him sorry that goes against what i stand for not throwing any stones i just clearly stated facts about biden throughout his career as a politician
he aint trump tho bruh support him in whatever good he can do he who is without sin let him cast the first stone
all the trumpists are insulting her and saying this speech is stupid and boring because 1 there to stupid to understand it 2 she isnt speaking at trumps inauguration that was never gonna happen 3 they are used to hearing mexicans bad fraud election and everyone is lying but me
gibberish
lol
what just is isnt always justice
dont you love her color scheme where have i seen those colors before bunch of f****** idiot
didnt hear the poem but i hate this way of speaking i guess its a poetic way of reciting i would rather have it spoken in a cold way than the breathless sounding way it is performed
sure
thank you
for sur gaga and lopez look so dull compare to this brillant mind
i never cried about things like this but that day was the day thats what i needed thank you
wow great poetry and an effective speech all in one i would like to see more poetical speeches
where can we find light in this never ending shadelove this entire poem and this beautiful young woman who wrote and delivered it to the world
awesome this is the very first time that i have ever clapped for anything on youtube
stopthesteal
wonderful 
the more i listen to this the i am in awe im in awe that someone so young can be so wide eyed and and insightful to capture the world this completely i have a pair of shoes older than her yet with all my added experience i sleepwalk through life unaware of how to express anything even close to this
at this time ( jan 21st 2021) the likes outnumber the dislikes by a ratio of 91 the lunatic 10% that is what rational america is dealing with the crazy/stupid are loud but they are massively outnumbered never forget this day and these words make america safe again
i thought this was filled with cliches not terribly impressed at all
jan 20 2021 no doubt is the saddest day in american history  dc looks like tiananmen square in 1989 a potus needs 50k army around him to stay in power
because of unlawful insurrection based off of proven lies caused dc to lockdown please listen to this gem to educate yourself or at least have a little soul  ill pray for you
brava 
apparently she was born premature and had auditory and speech processing issues all i can say is wow  im speechless  she is the highlight of this event
@christian hardwick jesus christ
@onthe right youre an indoctrinated conservative and thats not good how does yours or my opinion offer any unity it just makes us assholes
@lilmayo not as old as jim crow whininh
@lilmayo yeah almost as old as antifa whining
maga whining is getting old
i was also born with these issues and still struggle understanding people but i am white also descended from slaves but didnt have the privelege of being a black woman from la who was priveleged enough to have my single blacl mother somehow afford to put me in a 34k54k per year k12 program i also wrote speeches
@john citizen well if you are stupid enough then yes you are right lol
lmao 
but youre not speechless youve written a paragraph about it
@onthe right cry abt it he lost move on
@christian hardwick dont care much about politics in us im just happy coz i have a 460 baby boy 23weeker and this gives me hope  thats all
thats not saying much yay antifa bad patriots so much for unity
and gods sun was shining that day 
why was bill clinton there when he is jeffrey epsteins best friend
didnt speak for all religious groups and all ethnic backgrounds not to mention political groups all in all for every american citizen so it was a failure of a speech as an american i cant find myself in her speech shame on you
after she spoke trump was already forgotten
what will libs have to complain about now that their world view has been turned upside down hmmmm
and then trump spoke of forming a new political party and hes frontpage news again trump is _never_ going away
that ladies and gentlemen is how to communicate 
what an artist of words simply beautiful bravooooo
oh wow after four years of despairing of america from the other side of the pond i am now bowled over by such maturity and wisdom from one so young faith in the future restored
will be great for her cv
its a pain relief after all that hatred speech from that stupid guy wait i forgot his name already that speech makes me believe again there is a chance for humanity to recoverhope that more nations inhabitants follow her vision
she is phenomenal phenomenal phenomenal
 
kamala is not a descendant of enslaved africans in america (us) 
lets vote her for president
yet another of americas so many beautiful articulate young black ladies that make so many around the world proud the gates are open now
words are powerful
her gesture is beautiful thank you
not my president good luck traitors
sounds like rap
@london lion ha i see what you did there
racebaiting america dont speak racism thats not a black or white person thats an american racism can affect anyone to call racism poetry is sick to americans this is how obama got elected not for his qualifications blm hate group keeping racisms alive bidens bait for not apologizing live racist remarks towards true americans never support biden that is supported by communism china which america looks like right now morgan freeman
burisma joe
dr jill lmao the funniest line in this whole thing the other part which is not funny at all is that we now have one of the most corrupt persons in the white house and calls for unity and healing while calling 75 million americans bigots because they did not vote for him he is joe and he is joe bidens husband
its amazing how arrogant professional victims can be a mediocre talent (at best) lectures us hula style with her hair hat how the next generation is going to fix america  a bigger joke than grandpa dementias presidency
gorgeous just gorgeous watching this my heart feels so full for the first time in a very very long time i feel proud to be an american again   
so youre anti white
biden is the biggest threat to jobs he has already killed thousands of jobs and it is only his second day
the shining black swan trumps the orange glazed turkey
black girl magics finest
incredible
i dont see whats the fuss she is just ordinary even children these days can read and speak
except she is not a child and she wrote it the whole thing if thats all you got from it then you werent paying attention
shes going to be one of the greatest poets of this generation i can feel it
just beautiful queen chill was all over me listening to your real and spiritual words thank you queen and much love and stay safe shalom brothers and sisters 
when we dont judge others by the complexion of their skin this is what you can get she is the whole package
wtf my mum told me to do this but this good noice
wonderful poem young lady we have not seen all that god has in store for you keep your hands in his and allow him to guide you god bless you
inspiring i love her hamilton references too
that sound man was on point
a very intelligent young lady
beautiful i loved this and we needed to hear this as a nation
a truly powerful moment
she dances with words it is so beautiful
excellent
this brilliant human being is way beyond her years her speech was amazing and she deserves to be a political speaker for the white house or something motivating people in the right direction she would have my vote haha
who in the world are the people that hit a thumbs down on this magnificent beautiful and phenomenally gifted young black woman
toxic people
i may or may have not watched 3 separate videos of the same poem recitingcan you blame me it was so good
what a beautiful young lady words of wisdom beyond her age one day she will be standing right there taking her oath to our country
impeach biden
i hate to make the comparison but shakespeare poe (eminem) etc
beautiful classy brilliant huge best wishes to this young human being i wish i could shake her mothers and grandmothers hand they did this
soo beautiful and truthfully honest if she is the future we are good
fantastic poem trump has already been forgotten you stole my heart  i hope president biden is doing a lot better than his predecessor in 2036 i will be 74 i hope to see you as president of a much better world signed by marc a belgian citizen

45k give this illustrious poem a thumbs down some have a lesson to learn
how can anyone not see the powerful message from a 22 year old and the way it was crafted and articulated as anything but simply outstanding jealousy and hatredthats all it is
@t williams jealous of someone younger more intelligent and articulate go have a waank and a walk youll feel better
507 is definitely not something you can ignore
i wouldnt worry about this small minority i am more hopeful of a full generation of students who will become voters in the near future that will heed her words that makes me smile
i find this be very racist
we have to assume she passed the sniffing test from thebig guy
poet amanda gorman shines brighter than the sun her words provokes tears to roll on my face biden should hire her to write his speeches after seeing those violent thugs invading capitol hill amanda gorman is a refreshing example of how someone should conduct themselves
blah blah blah its everybodys country not the democratic partys
if thats all you got out of this poem then i feel truly sorry for you trump was right when he said he loved the poorly educated and youre a prime example
bravo young woman bravooo
awareness is known by awareness alone
bravo
very first time in a long time that this made me proud to live in america this was really good
i hope im alive by the time she runs for president of the united states
simply marvelous
now this is what you call a golden girl 
im not american but i feel her optimism woweverything she said is so preciseit makes me wanna cry so proud of her america is back who knows she might be the future president of the usagod bless america the world#heal
p o w e r f u l s t u n n i n g i n s p i r i n g poem  youth poet laureate ms amanda gorman thank you 
ill translate a victim talks about about being a victim in front of a victim supporting party and victim indoctrinated population still using slaves hundreds of years laterforever a victim
i wonder if she would be interested in amending our pledge of allegiance
how dare you say that it was a great poem but thats not going to happen
shes amazing i was overcome with emotions listening to her what a talent just beautiful
she has my vote
this woman is going to be president
actions speak louder than words even the most eloquent of speakers must prove themselves capable of backing up their claims through proactivity though such an idea has been contradicted far too many times these past few decades if she remains adamant to her principles in the event that she ever does enter politics then shell have gained more respect than any single wretch currently inhabiting dc otherwise shell be indistinguishable from them a talent in linguistics is just one desirable trait in leadership but remember that a silver tongue can be just as dangerous as any single weapon charisma is an especially effective tool used to beguile the masses to this very day
get your mouth off the crack pipe dude
holy smokes shes beyond words
@manuel hernandez never mind
beyond what words
@manuel hernandez she wrote the poem
she can read and now shes a star
a star is born
they said it right black people can rhyme
a powerful message for all
put a beat on it
affirmative action poet
so extraordinary i could watch it over and over
shes no maya angelou
tabula rasa they have a fixation with recruiting the young ones these people are sick
great here comes another another greta thunberg type
so nice to see another usa
illegitimacy
help us to be brave enough to see it and brave enough to be it
god bless you amanda
beautifulthe next president

she is a poet that was invited to recite for the president elect of america
sat year2250 reading section passage 1

she is absolutely without a doubt a racist white mans biggest fear
i love her tribute to maya angelou in the ring she wore
@bo pup biden got ring to
@denise biden ring of approval
@bo pup biden got the same ring

bravoyouth division
god im happy that my country is not run by ns
they forced themselves to the wh by stealing the election fraud
queit isnt peace
girl has listened to some kate tempest 3
what does she describe herself as in the poem
she speaks brilliantly with light and naivete to a sea of criminals
stephen couch you havent been on university campuses with all the snowflakes and lefties i guess their parents educated them to be such
@robert fabela there is a difference in knowledge based in facts and that based in opinion or interpretation now i agree when you have an extremist government the reliability of information would be problematic at best but thats still an extreme stance to take higher education isnt out there twisting facts they would lose accreditation
@jeff the indian chief thats true however im sure her harvard education was legitimate
@stephen couch it depends upon the credibility of ones instructor not all educators are created equal after all there is a reason why american educational institutions falter while other nations take the lead in topics like science mathematics there is no personalized education that compensates for ones weaknesses and there are instructors that would much rather teach you how to think not what to think
and these traitorous criminals approve of every propagandist word coming out of her mouth
@stephen couch education has always been filtered by the people in power you think you would learn the truth/knowledge from the nazi party or the confederate party or from oil companies every human being on the planet has an opinion and it is very very difficult for knowledge to be shared unfiltered and in an unbiased manner
@sgt koranflusher education doesnt corrupt
@lena price shes is already corrupted by her education/media/entertainment complex and that is the reason she is even standing there
you sound poetic
that light and naivete is in most of us when we first start off in our respective professions however many become corrupted due to the money power and greed its always refreshing to see the young full of hope and light i see that oprah has taken a strong interest in amanda many will be drawn to amanda because she has that spark but there will also be many who are looking to use exploit and take advantage of her
periodt
fabulous
she outshines the sun with her strength
a very wise talented young lady 
what kind of a person are you when you dislike a piece of art as this as is shown on the dislikes on this such sad miserable people in this world
so stunning and brave everyone get on your knees and start worshiping her 
thanks amanda for your presence
when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gaze not to what stands between us but to what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever by tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve have seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for well we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around our interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breathe from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wonderous one we will rise the from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it if only we are brave enough to be it
*if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it* will you contribute to the repair or destruction the question of our time
i hope eventually she is in charge
@ud small to make america to another third world shithole like africa go for it strong

tearyeyed and shivering thank you for the power and beauty of your words amanda gorman

amanda gorman listening/watching your speech at joe bidens inauguration on the 20th of january reduced me to tears as an afro caribbean person from the united kingdom  i must say i am proud i wasnt able to understand when maya angelou recited her poem at bill clintons inauguration as i was so young but i was able to witness yours and oh how powerful it was i wish all the success i know you will go on to be one of the greats
a country that is bruised but whole absolutely beautiful
@reaver red this is a poem written and performed by a gorgeous black woman maybe you misunderstood america is bruised we cant change the past but we work on the future bruised but whole its not racist its a beautiful line of poetry
sadly the country is not whole i hate lies
@onthe right i was quoting from the poem every country is bruised theres no where in the world that isnt try educating yourself there
wow was scrolling through comments and read this at the same time she said it  brilliant
brilliant
inspirational lady i was i aw when i heard her amazing lady a gift from god
its more of a word slam than a poem with all the fingers and stuff hehe
europeans colonizers white priveledged people many ancestors were the same people that took part in the holocaust astrocytes they see that in people of color/brown and allies are voting liked nothing before they feared loosing their priveledged and to have a world on equal grounds
wonderful words wonderful ideals wonderful respect wonderful love wonderful young lady
a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished a nation that is being reborn as a global nation of humans there is only one nation it is simply the world

beautiful poem but tired of the media and propaganda that america is a racist nation it is not we have had a black president we have black hispanic and asian senators so what am i missing people of today should not be looking into the past but the future enough already we have moved on
@betty boop correct everyone is racist to some level call it prejudice bias environmental educational or human condition a change of the human heart is needed tired of the media and government playing with our minds
want to see real racism try walking through a black neighborhood at midnight 
god bless joe biden and give him good health and strength in jesus name i prayer hallelujah amen
we are proud of you amandafrom south africa 
beautiful young lady and beautiful poem beautiful spirit and also humble blessings on her life and continue to move forward
we seek harm to none and harmony for all victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges we make ***united states*** listen to this young beautiful woman who is our future edit  these are the words of a young woman who broke boundaries
@anouk a newsflash not the empire that has committed crimes world peace ha laughableso all countries are on board to actually unite agree ummm no if that was the case we wouldnt need a united nations or peace treaty we are far from perfect but you need to do your homeworkwe are not holding up world peace the people in the whole world are doing so the lack of unity the refusal to let each be their own with no conflictand on and ontell her young scholarit is people like you that prevent and assume which only causes more chaos we step back not forward
@anouk a really stfu tell that to young brilliant mind that will/is the future of the country find her ig say iti will wait this exactly what she is talking about
she dissected the words onto a puzzle and brought them together to show a different word and world together well done
#propaganda
the head gear is as pretentious as the poem and the delivery
@austin  you ignorant putz you have no idea who i am or what i have accomplished in my life or how many people i have helped
@s955us84 no jealous that youll never achieve what she has achieved that day you will be sad forever i wish you luck
@nancy sterck zonnelied  maybe you are  but me jealous of that never
jealous
beautiful words beautiful person
she is incredible
wow
nobody wanna hear dat crap
that was beautiful i do take issue with one thing descended from slaves her descendants were enslaved but that slavery is not our only history
shes not ashamed of slave heritage thats why she put it in there glad she did
ffs
finally an inauguration video that doesnt have a 1123445678 like to dislike ratio
we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us she is the future there is hope for america and all of us
not a big fan of slam poetry but this was subtle and well done
a historic speech at the exact right moment
@reaver red when it was needed the most
if we merge mercy with might and might with right 
i cant be the only one who kinda wants to hear this as a rap right
is it just me or has anyone else noticed the divisiveness
wow
two words nailed it
kenneth on good morning america at 3amsaid if you give the young people a chance you will be surpriseall colorsthey are the future
wow outstanding poem  so perfectly timed and reflective of the state of the us i think ive listened to it a dozen times
as a scot im not too fond of us american soppiness imho a touching poem needs something its actually about not just cheesy big signal words to wallow in ones own sentiments and i dont think this is about anything halfconcrete edit fyi im a leftist i just dont like the poem very much
@betty boop its not propaganda its much too vague to be but not great poetry either
total propoganda bs for the hallmark crowd
the monster is in floridathanks be to god
im in florida too its gorgeous 
she knows her script poem she doesnt have to read it
not me cryin
the monster is in floridathanks be to god
rubbish amateurish and juvenile anyone who thinks otherwise should seek out good poetry
why the 42k dislikes
only a fool would select a 22yearold poet over a more mature poet the proof this girls poem is embarrassingly bad trite nonsensical predictable and clumsy elementary school level writing sad
@bethelhem gebeyaw its not personal or political its just bad writing sleepy is sending a signal about putting young people in charge but this perfectly illustrates why that is a bad idea it is great to have a black woman as the poet laureate i just feel that it should go to someone much older who has earned it and is surely a way way wayyyyy better poet than this young lady anyway that is all a matter of taste and i want you to know that  american to american  i respect your right to regard this as good poetry and i love you for expressing your disagreement with me in a balanced reasonable way you are adorable and completely disarming i am sorry i said your point was dumb that was not nice and not true i apologize
@bethelhem gebeyaw sorry but that is a dumb point i am not claiming to be a poet i have not been chosen to read at an inaugural address regardless i could do way better than this amateur
the monster is in floridathanks be to god
amazingly beautiful
something about her thats making her shinethe glow represents the glory of godwell done sis love from zimbabwe
as a grownass man i can proudly say this brought tears to my eyes
assassass
same man same
lol nice virtue signal bro
me too 
a grown ass man still rocking a patrick star profile picture is what brings tears to my eyes have a good life brother
it moves hearts because it speaks to the truth we all want but may not know how to find again as americans its never about a person but the people
sounds like something patrick would say
well  me too brother  in tears and grown ass as can be
i love her way of being her words and expression of them bravo young lady
bravo
we are entering into a new era and legacy lets make this universe  with out loosing its glory it has
beyond her amazing words her delivery was well i am speechless
shes amazing
beautiful the words and the young lady
even if you dont understand every word you should be able to grasp the overarching message anyone who feels the need to bash insult denigrate or impugn this lovely young lady and her positive words spoken on an auspicious occasion is truly a monster not to mention uneducated small bullish racist and soulless
shes the best
stupid  annoying girl fake
no matter democrat or repuplican i wish you all a good 4 years god bless and amen
it was the last act and i almost missed it but i heard it and walked immediately to the tv i love the gettysburg address and the story behind it and it reminds me of it sublime
shes amazing
what a biased so called poem
i am not american im a scot but this beautiful young ladys words were earth shattering if these words do not galvanise america to unite i dont know what will
thank you best wishes to those on the other side of the pond
yes yes yes
imagine spending the time to watch this masterpiece and still hitting the dislike button
who tf would spend the time to watch it
impeach joe malarkey his fraudulency the illegitimate installed puppet stooge
all that i needed to hear simply beautiful thank you amanda
great speakerthe highlight of the ceremony
i remember hearing her recite poetry a couple years ago when she became the first youth poet laureate not surprised at all that shes blowing up right now i am impressed with how well she overcame that speech impediment though check out the interview from 2018 with today with jenna bush hager she couldnt pronounce r at all
the references to what lin manuel miranda wrote  it makes me want to cry even if i am not american this girl is just perfect 
@kitt oohhh ok thank you for giving me this information and yes it was 
actually she was quoting george washingtons mount vernon speech (which lin manuel was also quoting) still a gorgeous poem regardless 
that was incredible
why am i crying im not even american
shes already an american treasurelike maya angelou and robert frost
i thought she was so classy beautiful girl
thats a girls looks is as beautiful as her intelligence
i believe she just changed the world  01/20/21
so we have 4k thumbs down on this beautiful speech  sad that you wouldnt like this speech unless you are a white supremacist
one word  amazing
stunningly beautiful in every way she and her mother must be so proud
wow
dr of death
my poetry needs much improvement there is a beauty in effortlessness a willie mays catch
mr illegitimate president
beautiful someone should put it on music
she will go down in history just wait we will see more of this young lady in the future
how we missed this beautiful country welcome back (
@reaver red was this meant to be an intelligent reply if yes i didnt get it (
@thugrug we and most of the world leaders ignored trump for the last 4 yrs d you are not the first country who voted for the wrong person and you will be not the last one keep save
danke we are glad to be back and glad you waited for us it has been a rough four years
terrorist nation
4000 dislikes from bitter trump paper boys
follow the sheep
i loved amandas original poem shes a very talented writer but even if one dislikes her work why cant people take joy in her unifying message and the fact that shes a young woman filled with hope and aspirations for americas future
it isnt unifying though is it come on really
we get to elect the sales reps for the powers that really run the country small hats still in control
and just like that she enters the history books and peoples hearts
@gloriamariadc yeah by insanity
@gloriamariadc smh yall need to get a grip
yes as a real star (not a pop star)
@tb wms yup
@freeclimb god will judge us all when that day comes well see whos lost and whos saved
@tb wms a lost soul
@freeclimb i believe you mean youre and not your what am i lost about
@freeclimb i am a christian so i only have one savior and its not biden i believe biden and harris will work very hard to fix so much that is currently broken in this country i certainly hope they succeed
@tb wms is this how your savior biden is going to make things better https//youtube/n1qiulgahxu
learn what a footnote is because she doesnt even rank that high
@tb wms your lost
shut up
and now you jinxed it cuz the comment section is still gonna exist in the future with everyone replying to you saying youre wrong congratulations you ruined the one chance black people had
@freeclimb im not going to get caught up in political talking points which are certainly not all accurate i know what represents a true christian and what doesnt if you think trump does may god have mercy on you i would put up bidens character against trumps any day one thing i do know we all have to reap what we sow and give an account of what weve done be blessed
hes devil  your days is over son
@tb wms so you think a clearly rascist biden represents good fruit common man he braged about the incarceration of black men for non violent offenses mr poor people are just as smart as white people trump facilitated four middle east peace deals which people said would be impossible trump helped facilitate historic low unemployment for blacks and other minorities black home ownership was at record highs so yeah i judge him (trump) by the fruit of his works the media told viscous lies about trump to hinder and destroy him repeatedly took his words and comments out of context and mislead gullable people like you if you think god has ordained biden to be president in the worst deception of the american people in the history of this country quite frankly you have a lot of soul searching to do just because you say trump left in disgrace doesnt mean he did you all said he wouldnt leave peacefully and he did you all lied about him inciting violence when he clearly said to protest peaceably you all make me sick and now you have the nerve to deify biden as some sort of twisted savior please dont hes not and i judge you by your words and actions as rotten fruit for supporting this insanity
@freeclimb if you believe in god you would be able to discern why trumps presidency ended the way it did the bible tells us you will know them by their fruit as a christian i presume you understand this passage of scripture please honestly tell me the type of fruit trump represents and is it the type that jesus would want us to become
thats easy  after the demofascists delete the history they dont like  theres plenty of room in the book to fill  liars cheaters and theves 
not mine just a bunch of words under the circumstances its meaningless
freeclimb what are you actually trying to get at
freeclimb so does yours
@r o a c h e s your reply makes no sense
tata shhh
freeclimb aww youre so pressed
@tata dont pay attention to those people they like to deify those that think like them its mental illness really just like trump derangement syndrome where nothing he did could be construed as good now they show depictions of biden coming down from the heavens like a god i realize it is extremely disturbing to see but it is the mental illness that is socialism you see if you dont belive in god youll believe in anything even a rascist old man who is clearly suffering from dementia as savior of their world view
im not from america so pls explain like everyone who happened to dospeech at inauguration goes straight to history books but like why strange
freeclimb whats funny
blahahahahaha blahahahahaha thats funny
i am guessing that all the dislikes are from the other party this is a beautiful poem regardless
@reaver red thanks for thinking about my future i have no interest in politics my friend just took a wild guess as i stated in my comment and to clarify as im reading and looking at my comment it was meant to say regardless what side you are on  have the best life
she has the youth of maya angelous spirit  
i was very impressed by that beautiful young lady and her poem beautiful best wishes from ireland
her voice and conviction woke me up bravo amanda incredible woman you are
am proud to b a black
more inspirational in 5 minutes than melania will ever be
after living on memes the power of the well crafted spoken word is shattering
the only good comment ive read here
@abahgus ok boomer
thats youre own fault you let cultural engineers program you
noits *uplifting healing empowering* but i get what your saying 
what a steaming pile of rhyming and almostrhyming platitudes shes up front about her political ambitions looks like shes got what it takes   getting down to reality  we must first put our differences aside by impeaching the outgoing president we lay down our arms by flooding the capital with troops
 more troops than we have in afghanistan

want a bet first thing raise the costs of fuel home heat@ first thing that they will do is attack the costs of living@ then buy up for pennies on the dollar@ like they did in 2008@ 589 billion was their incentive not divided amoung working class@@ but full filled their plans
i keep watching and listening to her recite her poem over and over in awe such beautiful words such a talented mind such a powerful performance to the haters who disliked this video  i am very sad for you that your mind is so diminished with hatred that you fail to see the beauty power grace and hope
those dislike are basket of deplorable
care to elaborate i mean what exactly makes you dislike the poem
i consider myself to be rational way above the standard of an average stupid citizen yet i hated every second of this seriously if i was there i would just cover my ears with every piece of fabric on me
thats the passion of what america is all about that sets us apart
she took my breath away what a bright intellligent and wonderful young lady it makes me proud to be an american she has wisdom beyond her years
magnificient
youth is the future i am going to find more of amandas work great sentiments and artistry
it is black magic satanic

1/21/2021 blackhawk goes down in flames today hahaha what a fitting start to a biden menstruation i pray this evil country/empire burn in jesus name amen for you biblical idiots that amen means thats that nothing to do with gender idiots
we are all nazis now success https//wwwamericanthinkercom/articles/2021/01/fascism_is_backhtml
quiet isnt always peacein quiet there is something raging inside just like a deep water stream that is calm and quiet on the surface but has a strong current in its depth
now now daisy dont you go down that road too of trying to explain away the violence and intimidation of last summer as if the deepwater stream cant help it its raging currents beneath are part of its makeup well that might be true for a deepwater stream but humans have agency and morals its funny how the tens of thousands of young people involved in the street disturbances last year also seek their absolution the poets words from the pulpit are set to soothe their conscience and console their raging minds as if grandma would now understand (grandma who grew up with very little) the poets words you quote tie in directly with the no justice no peace cry out on the streets her words from the pulpit in front of the capitol to america and the world (as she would have it) are a lecture and a rather stern one at that her words are more shameonyouamericasofar than an appeal to all that has been good about america and for consequently for the world
@freeclimblol yeah i see what you mean i just wanted to quote a book in relation to the subject 
@fritz wulfhard considering all the psudo intellectualizing going on it had to be said
@freeclimb well duh of course it is
@fritz wulfhard sometimes silence (or quiet) is just that silence or quiet
silence can create its own violence
school libraries
it depends on ones heart
no sometimes silence is violence 21 pilots
burned my voting card today feels very liberating wouldve posted video but not sure how im done with that garbage why vote just to have it negated by thieves never voting again
damn thats deep
have tears in my eyes just listening /watching
she is awesome
thank you sister
all men need women like her1st
she should be a speech writer
it was obvious that she would rap her poem and some antiamerican tards actually like it
shes so amazing
she is fire *10
ms gorman was a gift of light after an interminable period of racism hatred and abject incompetence contrast ms gorman to the stylings of mcenany to see clearly the difference between the progress presented by the democratic party and retrogression of the once gop
if only your brave enough to be light  i love that we all have light in us  dont give into ego or hate or fear thats darkness
why is an african woman representing american poetry
if you listen to her words you would know
wow
this is beautiful  i was born and raised in this country i sang the national anthem and said the pledge of allegiance for 26 years of my life to be disowned in the only land i ever know is sad i was never welcomed was treated differently all the time  im proud to be who i am today  as an american asian muslim i was always living in terror because of ignorant hate threats towards me i feel so proud of putting on my veil  thank you biden and kamala harris for accepting and always mentioning different cultures and races  land of the free this is to the american people 
322 history has its eyes on us sorry all i can hear is hamilton but really this was amazing what an incredible young woman
she said in an interview she recited a part from hamilton it went well with what she was describing
shes incredible gracefully charming
the bewildered lamb endogenously provide because burst early open including a strong trout festive acceptable pedestrian
such powerful and positive spirit is she a fabulously fine and brilliant nubian princess ~ rlkemp
and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished is exactly what i feel about cyberpunks release
beautiful queen said the right words in time of need in this country america is alive again
she make satanic ritualnothing nice satanic ritual for cabala who keep the earth in wars
my goodness  i need just one word on you to create my future  congratulation
does anybody else get the impression that this girl is all about style im not saying there is no substance but im saying the emphasis is definitely on style i think at her age she should be a little more lowkey less intense  she can save the intensity for when she gets older it would be more effective at that point in time rather than trying to sound like a famous orator at her age
i love her beautiful yellow coat  she was definitely the much needed ray of sunshine   flower of hope for everyone
i loved you
happy day
amanda gorman poema dito na tomada de posse do presidente joe biden traducao de carlos campos a montanha que escalamos quando chega o dia perguntamonos onde podemos encontrar luz nesta sombra sem fim a perda que carregamos a travessia de um mar tao longo assim enfrentamos a besta de frente aprendemos que a paz nao e silente e que as normas e conceitos do que e justo nem sempre sao justica e ainda assim o amanhecer e nosso antes de o sabermos de algum modo nos fazemos de algum modo nos resistimos e testemunhamos uma nacao que nao esta quebrada mas apenas inacabada somos os sucessores de um pais e de um tempo em que uma menina negra magrinha descendente de escravos e criada por uma mae solteira pode sonhar tornarse presidente apenas para se encontrar recitando para um e sim estamos longe de ser polidos longe da pureza mas isso nao significa que estejamos a esforcarnos para formar uma uniao perfeita estamos a esforcarnos para formar uma uniao com um proposito para compor um pais comprometido com todas as culturas cores personagens e condicoes do homem e entao levantamos os nossos olhares nao para quem esta entre nos mas para quem esta diante de nos acabamos com a divisao porque sabemos que para colocar o nosso futuro em primeiro lugar devemos primeiro por de lado as nossas diferencas depomos as nossas armas para que possamos estender os nossos bracos uns para os outros a ninguem desejamos mal a todos desejamos harmonia que o mundo diga pelo menos estas verdades que mesmo quando sofremos crescemos que mesmo em sofrimento tivemos esperanca que mesmo cansados tentamos que estaremos para sempre ligados vitoriosos nao porque nunca mais conheceremos a derrota mas porque nunca mais semearemos a divisao as escrituras dizemnos para imaginar que todos devem sentarse a sombra da sua videira e figueira e ninguem lhes causara medo se quisermos viver o nosso proprio tempo entao a vitoria nao estara na lamina que brandirmos mas em todas as pontes que construirmos essa e a promessa de clareira a montanha que escalamos se ousamos e porque ser americano e mais do que um orgulho que herdamos e o passado de que fazemos parte e o modo como o reparamos vimos uma forca que destruiria nossa nacao ao inves de a partilhar destruiria o nosso pais se significasse adiar a democracia e esse esforco quase teve sucesso mas embora a democracia possa ser periodicamente adiada nunca pode ser permanentemente derrotada nesta verdade nesta fe nos confiamos porque enquanto tivermos os olhos no futuro a historia olhara por nos esta e a era da redencao justa tememos quando comecou nao nos sentiamos preparados para ser os herdeiros de uma hora tao terrivel mas no intimo encontramos a forca para escrever um novo capitulo para oferecer esperanca e risos a nos mesmos enquanto antes perguntavamos como poderiamos prevalecer sobre a catastrofe agora nos afirmamos como pode a catastrofe prevalecer sobre nos nao vamos marchar de volta para o passado mas para o que deve ser um pais ferido mas inteiro benevolente mas ousado feroz e livre nao seremos mandados para tras ou barrados pela intimidacao porque sabemos que a nossa omissao e inercia sera a heranca da proxima geracao os nossos erros serao os seus fardos mas uma coisa e certa se fundirmos misericordia com poder e o poder com o direito entao o amor sera o nosso legado e mudara o destino dos nossos filhos deixemos para tras um pais melhor do que aquele que nos deixaram em cada respiracao do meu peito de bronze ergueremos este mundo ferido para um mundo maravilhoso erguernosemos das montanhas douradas do oeste erguerernosemos do nordeste varrido pelo vento onde nossos antepassados fizeram a revolucao pela primeira vez erguernosemos das cidades junto aos lagos dos estados do centrooeste erguernosemos do sul queimado pelo sol reconstruiremos reconciliaremos recuperaremos e em cada canto conhecido de nossa nacao e em cada esquina do nosso pais o nosso povo diverso e belo surgira batido e belo quando chega o dia saimos da sombra com vigor e sem medo o novo amanhecer floresce a medida que o libertamos pois ha sempre luz se tivermos a coragem para a ver se tivermos coragem para a ser * the mountain we climb when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it

thank you amanda god bless you )
that was inspiring hell even the yellow was uplifting wasnt it yep thanks for it
yellow is always cheerful/uplifting thats one reason i have a a lot of it in my home and why i chose yellow/mustardcolored raincoats and umbrellas for those grey rainy days
lol yes the yellow was lovely l
amazing black magic in full force  she killed that
your words give hope to generations and your poem was the highlight of the whole event if we merge the light the might and the rights we will all have a future god bless you amanda
this 22yearold absolutely left my ghastedflabbered unfortunately however l am reminded of the difference between her and another 22yearold  mira ponsetta privileged pampered clueless who tackled a 14yearold black child in a hotel lobby in front of his father accusing his of stealing her phone then went on national tv to describe herself as supersweet while refusing to acknowledge her crime amanda gorman im trying to catch my breath phew
ive had tears in my eyes so powerful im satisfied
poetry matters
robert frost is smiling as this 22 year old as a graduate of harvard university gave america hope for the future our future is very promising as people like amanda gorman see the truth about the americanexperience moving forward god bless the world with love and reconciliation the future is transparent with democracy freedom t j (tom) vanderloop author teacher a manufacturing engineer/consultant to industry
i wouldnt compare this to robert frost or maya angelou
wow american pride restored
dont b blind pplwhat they plan 4us is 415 (( sadly its resemble graveyard of humanity behind all those prosperous proclamations   our blenders became their burdens## where silent individuals planted like crops into matrix settings   hoping amd praying that lord justice will deliver us all 4sakeof our children future
these are the viral videos our planet needs a moment when technology and internet platforms are useful and needed no lies or hateful rhetoric just a realistic and optimistic view of our human condition i didnt see anyone percolating into a violent frenzy instead i saw many in the solace of deep reflection and humility it was the time to ponder who we are and what we are doing the insurrection was initiated by those who chose to follow and believe hateful opinionated tweets or videos this video allows you to discern and choose your own path im choosing to change the channel to those platforms which allow me to learn and absorb facts thereafter promote me to independently seek additional facts through other outlets to make my decisions in life nothing wrong with being a followerif you follow the facts
what a pleasure to see inclusion decency and kindness it was a delight to meet amanda gorman who is stunningly brilliant in her words and delivery i will be hoping to read any of her poems if she continues to write it will be a gift to all of us
am really happy and proud of you amanda may god continue to protect you and bless you may you leave long to be honest coming american president in time to come much love stay safe
beautiful
omg wow how gracious and beautiful
quiet isnt always peace
when she said the phrase we shall rise i got goosebumps all over
@leah fontaine if you did some research you would see that she was a speaker at harvard university and many significant events shes a role model for the young people
stop the coke
absolutely superb
read the constitution the bill of rights is for all citizens
biden begins his questionable presidential term with more selfrighteous harping on the slavery that ended in america 150 years ago slavery that ended because thousands of white americans fought and died in agony on 19th century battlefields to end it meanwhile beijing biden has lined his pockets for decades with the profits of actual modern slavery in china the hypocrisy and disconnect is grotesque
@betty boop biden has no financial linking to china this isnt from a political source this is just a fact no evidence has ever accused him of that no evidence has pointed at that no investigation has ever occurred on those allegations and thats because it never happened dont act as if a politically motivated accusation is true just because someone said it
it is completely true do some research outside of cnn
that simply isnt true
actions speak louder than words
@skipper russell true however that is a matter of individual perspective
@hliz and those actions can be detrimental
true however words often inspire actions
fun fact she graduated from harvard
wow what an honor to see history being made congratulations amanda
you will see the truth soon
the most memorable moment of that inauguration was her reciting this poem breathtaking
she was at blm in boston last summer
someone speaking with that much eloquence beauty and soul almost offset the ugly joyless stupidity thats dominated the last four years but we must never forget what happens when elect a clown off the tv
an election that needs investigating has there been foul play in he vote counting democracy demands transparency
@hliz where were they thrown out can you send me a link or summary that would be helpful thanks again
@ozricaurora can you point me towards some of these that would be very helpful thanks
@nigel anderson the investigation they tried starting 60 of them but all were thrown out because they had neither a clear accusation or evidence this is all public record
@nigel anderson maybe do the research yourself theres loads of articles
@ozricaurora thanks for that can you show me the full report on the investigation or a link to the investigation
it was investigated where have you been the last two and a half months
i think president biden should give her a position in his cabinet the spirit of martin luther king is inside her absolutely and epic poet and hopefully ready one day to take the oath of office
plot twist  its the democrats that keep racism thriving to control the minorities
@blast you clearly arent black the changes are evident
@hliz just look at the biden and harris careers they were never qualified to take office urban blacks and poc have been voting democrat for 50 yrs and nothings changed probably even worse every four years they rile up the blm crowd to get the black vote for their candidates
 um sure about that
bla bla bla bla
very good young lady
never sow division
it is all based off of emotionalism for them but that which strikes your feelings shouldnt trump the common sense and business like mindset it takes to run this country
i wonder if amanda gorman knows racist joe said he didnt want his kids growing up in a jungle referring to racially integrated schools of course not because the democrat party has brainwashed african americans all for their vote
teach
no times change and people change with it biden has clearly shown to be a ally to minorities
fraudulent
beautiful inspirational kissed by heavenly spirits  thank you
where are the first peoples
3 of my classes today needed me to watch this video today 
goosebumps is the word
first stupid ass move from idiot dementia joe was to open up travel from hostile countries like iran now they can send any terrorist here to take revenge and why did he do it because its more important to dementia joe to be pc than to protect american lives now he put us all at risk and the blood will be on his hands not if but when we are attacked again on us soil well done liberals
@fen fen and you realize it was biden who voted for the iraq war and has been part of the military industrial complex in washington for decades causing those wars abroad i voted for trump to keep us out of war and he did the four years of peace are over the swamp is back get ready for more wars
if this is what we are going to see over and over and over and over again what ever company makes barf bags please crank up your manufacturing line because we the people will be barfing up our collective guts this phony crap being splattered all over the media we are going to need a whole bunch of barf bags
the sappy stuff is just on inauguration day its meant to ease people around the country who are worried about the new president
beautiful young ladyso inspiring and gives us all hope
for one thing one god
that was excellent
earthwere is corona
colorless
poet is a poet
the words the expression the words listen everyone every american put your foolishness aside at the end of the day the divisiveness is not worth it see how many are now placed on nofly list see how many may face long prison terms it is not worth it lets move forward
not quite up there with john betjeman but it was ok
english teachers from now on and so on class kindly write a 5page reaction paper about the speech of amanda gorman during the 2021 inauguration 
i already wrote papers for students on this keep the orders coming
@yeey arent you that funny guy from the silent movies 
@kat ugh gross you know going through public school made me hate public school we are all descended from slaves this speech is self endulgent
doing it right now 
im doing it right now in a mexican school here en mexico city haha
my teacher already got me writing a essay on it right now
im here rushing to dis and its due at 8 am
pro liberal reactions only
i am having a lesson rn about it d
same kek
god damn it ihave to do it right now
@kat same here
lol how did you know
what do you mean 2022 we are doing this in ap lit today
we are happy she is wearing the colours of my country  she does really introduce the new president biden in a worthy way preparing us to get ready for whats to come
yes the colors of another country
the words of a young girl indoctrinated into hatred and victimhood mentality elevated to thought leader how sad and racist that was a speech not a poem
@aaron ede  okay you didnt even listen to her poem i completely understand what youre talking about and i hate when people do that but there was no victimhood or demonization
@hliz your words dont act like you can judge her brilliance in any way shape or form shes not brilliant at all shes an ideologue shes a a lazy thinker as is typical of all ideologues shes carrying water for a rotten ideology whose central tenet is victimhood any ideology that preaches victimhood as virtue and demonizes people based on group identity is evil her ideology is the same model as that of every oppressor group that has ever existed she and her ilk are well on their way to doing very evil things
@aaron ede when did i ever say her ideas werent debatable i said that her brilliance was undebatable explaining unity and its purpose and the hill we climb to become a better people for future generations isnt bigoted and grotesque nor is it gross so its unclear why you would think that
@hliz shes 22 i can definitely judge her and challenge her ideas and words in many obvious ways the idea that her ideas arent debatable is fully authoritarian illiberal antiintellectual and absurd shes hustling hate and not much else her speech is peppered with bigoted and grotesque ideas it was gross
while a speech has a set purpose and a motivating factor a poem is an art form which uses words to express a transcending idea this young girl is a youth laureate dont act like you can judge her brilliance in any way shape or form
4 years of darkness now the shadow of hope kindle in the horizon congratulation american people as a new chapter of your history begins
the 37k who dislike this video thank you for listening i know you heard
@warrior tactical extended loop i am a doctor
@reaver red well said sir
true
@vania elizabeth espinoza false hope is not a good thing in many cases its just a denial of reality and when youre in denial about reality you cant think critically america is in a state of emergency and the sheep would rather be recipients of some flowery words delivered by an adorable little girl who has not truly found her voice yet  the one that speaks truth to power only by speaking truth to power and inspiring people to actually take constructive action will there be change (for the better) in america people are very carefully selected to give speeches/perform at the inaugurals and are told why they can and cannot say they have to tread very lightly (edit themselves) be weak and/or deliver flowery word salads
i certainly dont like trump or think he was a in any way acceptable as a president but the fact is 75 million of your fellow citizens voted for him to talk about braving the belly of the beast because you side didnt win last time is insulting to your country and democracy
@warrior tactical extended loop i do not like most of what she does i did like this song though
you absolutely heard jlo and gaga toothis land was made for you and me
what is wrong with all you people on this comment thread where is the hope that things are going to get better
@warrior tactical extended loop  pretentious flailing
linmanuel is proud
ive not made it past the one minute mark and already 
amazing beautiful
oooh so touching
this was a good performance of an inauguration you all will see soon this was a fictional performance
in one word magic this is americagreat 
i dont think ive heard anything more moving
absolutely beautiful i felt like crying listening to her
wow bars after bars after bars in her poem the next maya angelou weve been waiting for you
if only were brave enough to see it  if only brave enough to do it in jesus name amen
what is that fake jesus has to do with thiswhere is he where is he at to save us all
oh wow shes openly talking about killing white people on inauguration day
well trump talked about killing black people and mexicans when he was inaugurated and openly admired hitler so this is just balancing
 
im indian kamlaa harrison is half indian i think she sold her soul to the devil i only believe in christ jesus
amanda thunburg wannabe
this poem is crap
this poem is crap
ooh dare god bless americans more and more and hlep my country uganda
i dont see her wearing a mask sorry not sorry if im not using the proper pronoun
trump supporters try to reviewbomb this but unfortunately for trump he only has 36k supporters in total
saw that too lol always funny to see the review bombs like it matters at all to any sensible person with intelligence
kamala harrison is not african american she is half indian and half jamaican
@rasheda hinkle because she is biracial not black
and why was that important
she still half black then if shes jamaican
amanda you remind me of maya angelou one of my favourite poem writers you have a wisdom which is incredible and the beauty of your words are touching may all that youve said come true and may your birthrights never be forgotten
i did not vote for biden i do respect him as our president because the office deserves respect this young american is beautiful as are her words please americans dont look back look forward heed the words of unity spoken at this inauguration as an american who spent her childhood on military bases my father gave 21 years of service i know what a united america looks like no matter where we came from no matter our ethnicity no matter our religion or politics we all lived as one
incredible message delivered with poise grace and passion
dumb all i heard was  i want free stuff
you aint black
im proud of you amanda
thank you amanda gorman your words your voice your vision i feel privileged to have listened to your recitation of thoughts and witnessed your wisdom
finally once again proud to be american she was stunning and awesome
@encore baby being present and being engrained in culture is two different things out of all the european nations france is likely the only one whose culture and identity revolves around the ideals of enlightnment which from top to bottom make up american identity
@encore baby being american means pro democracy pro dialogue debate antiviolence of any form pro science pro humanitarian pro liberty human rights freedom of speech freedom of movement freedom of opinion freedom of press freedom of ownership federal policy the many to the few and vice versa one world one love respect to every culture to dream big and not get comfy to less hi from greece the origin of the american dream
@encore baby how about you just leave
stunning and brave
i straight criedi was depressed and feeling sorry for myselfthank you princess no more pity parties for me
please take care of yourself
the whole thing was a pretty boring and pathetic
just want to share we purchased our official historic presentations of the entire inaugural events and other items of president biden and vice president harris from biden inaugural store at @t restoring peace and president biden speak like an eloquent leader we received our historic glassware and they are very nice
ya stuttering biden is eloquent
wow what a breathtaking message
i love the hamilton references
thanks dear
your past is war and money no matter what you do it will be your future too
i dont see any asian american or middle eastern american why because theyre strong and comfortable in theyre own skin the loudest one in the room is always the weakest one
wonderful heartfelt best wishes from the uk  so glad to see america back in the family where it belongs
i would vote for this young woman
she spitting bars
jill biden was married to joe bidens best friend  jill biden cheated on her husband with joe biden  only a low life would bang his best friends wife
you are aware of trumps track record with women arent you
and how many wives has the donald had greg youre a fool
a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it
every nation want have future should have like her god bless her
fake speech
kamala harris first woman of color to blow her way to the white house
meme material
napoleon dynamite happy hands club
like a brazilian i hope that we can kick bolsonaros and his diabolic crew in the butt like you did with trump and also that we can raise a good leader that can unite with love and demolish the old paradigms make a racial and social just true democracy but i also hope that biden change the way that us make politics in other countrys no more tyranny no more domination the world urges for world cooperation lets change this rude and raw democracy
  for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it the hill we climb amanda gorman
wow what a talent
i lost count of how many times i watched her already it is so beautiful to watch 
so so devil s slave s r u still dont get it soon i will show my selfe
how do you repair a broken country when you keep pointing fingers and spill more oil into the fire
this may be the new maya angelo
just beautiful 
maya angelou reborn
this was so incredible what an amazing woman
they get her to help fool us she black but the ones who got her are not pay attention people dont get caught up in the hype or false hope
how refreshing someone who thinks/knows this is the inoculation poem  inoculation against (truly hearing) the truth truth is spoken without saying a word the girl looked lovely in the color of optimism (yellow) quite neat and cute but the poem was just a flowery word salad edible flowers of the falsehope kind theyre (those in power) saying here ados sheep (and other gullible americans) chew on thiswhile we fool you again
alright whos the comedian that put her up to this and where is the beatnik in the turtleneck with the bongos 
strong
watching from canada so powerful
outstanding
genius
a little black girl how poetic
can you hear anf understand thatriot
disgusting display of a paradeinstead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
they can have their cake and eat it too be careful what you wish for
yeah also joe biden persecuted blacks for his entire career but lets just skip that
tell it and conmala does not like ados blacks she only slept with one (da mayor) so she could get further in her career most brahmin dont like black peopleno matter what their lineage
drakes ghost writer taking notes 
her staccato movement imagery turn of phrase so beautifully orchestrated her mouth a symphony of the future american voice
quick one before watching this did she twerk
when is she running for president
when she has enough political experience
brava amanda da italia lago di como
extremely charged and a poem that just increased division in this nation
this is propaganda for blacks saying basically everything is ok now that the democrats have stolen the election and taken over so go back to your daily lives and dont notice the fact that we they are going to do absolutely nothing for youbut dont worry in 3 1/2 years from now police brutality will be back on your tv screens and we will be promising you the world again if only we can have your vote
bars
fantastic
republicans will be quiet for 4 years now
i dont now inglish but she say something good 100% i think
nicely done but i fail to understand what all the fuzz is about  obamas inauguration featured a great inspirational poem as well
shall i despise the type of people who give this a thumb down or feel sorry for them or simply ignore their existence
black excellence 3
perfect i could listen to her words all day amanda you have renewed my faith in poetry and the uplifting power of language thank you for my favourite part of the inauguration
phenomenally executed 
wow well done
wow ad coming good
joe biden is not a president of the united states of america he was sworn in ten minutes early that is according to him twentieth amendment https//constitutioncongressgov/constitution/amendment20/ is not a president the presidentelect has to be on the dot on jan 20 at 1200 noon i suspect that the united states of america is under military control
@steelboss why do you still answer me d great that you know i make no secret of it
@siri b you are completely boring i am done
@steelbossaha youre already thinking about the wedding thats great that you said it
@siri b you want me u want to try you want to see it
@steelboss babe anyone who justifies himself will accuse himself *
@siri b no i dont like little pickles you are a little pickle maybe your mommy likes little pickles why dont u go watch cartoons
@steelboss nice that you like little pickles *
@siri b yea only a little pickle no real meat sounds like a very small problem
@steelboss but maybe vegetables like pickle *
@siri b i dont like snacks
@steelboss yeah and play with you *
@siri b ok little boy go play outside
@steelboss dummy u dems think we got no evidence but clearly when u see it u delete it
yupp
@steelboss that is a fact sheep
ignorance much
taaalk
well said
not great trying too hard to be the next maya angelou
grausiger propaganda dreck
lets hope she is not the next greta thunderberg just used to push forward an agenda usually every look here is a sensation lets show her on all television channels people turn out this way
the new dawn balloons that makes no sense is a bad metaphor she wasnt that good
@xlt 20g571 your opinion my bad
@rasheda hinkle why hater im just pointing out if you are delivering poetry at an inauguration and are supposedly that good you shouldnt be making mistakes like that it should be perfect
hater
omg in 5 seconds she showed more poise elegance intelligence and leadership than the fat cheeto showed in his entire life
voice of reason and a breath of freshness she spoke every word of hope and pride to what #45 was trying to desecrate
note this woman has worked hard (and still works on it to this day) to overcome a speech impediment and she is a harvard graduate

my guess would be 90% of the people who didnt like it probably didnt understand it and the other 10% are just haters it was an amazing use of alliteration and current events wrapped into one every word had meaning and it was powerful and needed to be said this was the highlight of the day and 50 years from now people will study this work for a greater understanding of this current time amazing and i hope you get more opportunities to speak because you are the hope and voice of the future
this woman is amazing i am so proud of her #blackgirlmagic 
can we talk about how good that yellow jacket looks
thats was the only good thing that came out of this
the grotesque badger sadly attend because thailand partly tick about a obscene fly tacit taboo color
she is a beautiful soul i know her parents are so proud
fantastic words
a speech thats worth to be compared with martin luther kings
absolutely
truly amazing #blackgirlmagic
lol trump was supposed be here but he wants to cry in back corner of his room
joe biden bye bye trump amanda is such a wonderful soul   i hope to see more from her sometimes  such a joy to listen to 
whew amazing just amazing
i see jay z reaching out to her with a million dollar contract
soothing words for the emotionals from a poetaster 
watching this for the 3rd time and i still feel my hairs stand up
the makeshift fender bailly preach because tendency mathematically save but a wise wind obsolete gifted output
hey yall if you go thru the comments and keep track of all the negative ones youll know exactly who the dislikes are from there are 3600 thumbs down and 4100 comments as of this exact moment fortunately those of us who are happy hopeful for a fresh start future can easily spot the ignorant idiots  also ms gorman is incredible and beautiful everything about her and her poetry/ reading is just so accurately wonderful spot on  shes a blessing to the universe  periodt she makes me incredibly forever proud to be a fellow poet 
funny how libs have to trash their opposition before they feel comfortable enough to compliment someone virtue signaling at its finest 
only if we are brave enough to be it drop the mic time
amanda gorman such beauty and elegance a rising star thank you for your poem
resist delay obstruct protest  not my presdient
she killed this i love it
the people who clicked thumbs down must be evil and full of hateno wonder the world is in a horrible mess
wasnt impressed
@kiss freak it was annoyingexcessive
napoleon dynamite happy hands club
the hands moving is dorky
beautiful poet with a positive message
politics is stinky
fr
who is the white lady at 355 does anyone know
yes
the scrpiture says oh no everyone shall sit under their own vine here they come and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid *d o o r s l a m s* hamilfans theyll be safe in this nation weve made i want to sit under my own vine and fig tree a moment alone in the shade at home in this nation weve made one last time
i did not vote for biden but i am happy to see this young lady speak so beautifully this is an example to young people to move away from all the likes and ums an example of rhetoric and using a positive message to rebuild and reconcile as she so beautifully put
amazing 
a very eloquent and words of hope delivery
bravo
imagine a rap song like this o
 usa is back to the world congrats american people your country is full of precious gems 
wow imagine being her parents so talented and beautiful i was smiling the whole time she was reciting
in her poem she said we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one she is going to run for president in 2036 her first opportunity when she will be 38 years old bravo to ms gorman and her mother
flawless
we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms is america and the world listening
thats cheap talk after the last four years of liberal hysteria hard to take anything serious from this group after all the bs we have heard from them the same people enabled mentally ill people to feel justified to physically assault an innocent stranger because they were wearing a maga hat
my just one of my favorite parts of the poem
yes and i can tell you that usa bombarded yemen and libia  thank you obama wonderful poet ok but when you slaughter 50 k civilians in north africa everything falls appart
if i had a voice like that id be so happy if i had confidence like that wait i never will
even her hands have something to say
i shall remember this on the overmorrow
wow this is an amazing poem
fajna opaska hahahahhaha jak stroz w boze ciao boze chron nas od kultury amerykanskiej bo jest tak kiczowataamen
amazing amanda 
the pumped tights positionally pull because hippopotamus luckily bow on a petite badge orange straight astronomy
if that was my daughter i would be a proud dad america congratulations
@glenda stevens with young women like that my faith in america is returning ps all the best from the netherlands
sadly her father abandoned his family and her mom raised her alone in california her mom is an english teacher and worked hard to see her daughter graduate from harvard and become a poet laureate when oprah contacted amanda before the inauguration and told her that she wanted to send her the perfect coat and dress for the ceremony amanda said thanks ms winfrey but i already have my coat and dress picked out lol shes a boss
and tomorrow she will be forgotten 
actually thats untrue her books (that havent been released) were already best sellers in terms of pending sales and she was offered a tenuredtrack professorship position at a historically black college (morgan state university) yesterday keep in mind shes only 22 and just graduated from harvard she has achieved more in 22 years than what most will achieve in a lifetime my guess is amanda will ride the wave and make a few million with several additional book deals
merci beaucoup merci 
im not american  swedish but wow i watch this young girl with tears in my eyes theres still hope for america i hope to live until she becomes potus
bars 
just empty words nothing will change at all xddd
oh god its so bad
wow
so proud of you amanda you are a breath of fresh air that we all needed youre awesome may god continue to bless you

such eloquence and wisdom from one so young  she stole the show 
what a beautiful profound narrative from a beautiful 22yr old young girl
what an awesome poem from such a beautiful and articulate young lady our children are our hope for this country and for the world i wish everyone peace  prosperity and love to everyone
beautiful and powerful an excellent recital my congratulations to president joe biden and vice president kamala harris on this auspicious day i sincerely hope the united states of america will be able to heal itself and that equality and justice prevail and overcome the selfishness and fear i hope the united states of america will now see the recent past 4 years as a call for a better future my very best wishes to the united states of america
the best evershe easily outshone lady gaga and jennifer lopez just marvelous
that recital erased the surreal cruelty  cynicism name calling violence of the last 4 years  almost 
she is inspirational
this was a regime change not an inauguration no wonder they had to ballot harvest good grief
invictus and i have a dream beautiful merged by a new generation
that was a good a$$ poem inspiring and refreshing to hear i think the world needed to hear this with everything that has happened and is still happening definitely moved my heart and soul every word is beautiful 
there is always light only when we are brave enough to see it if only we are brave enough to be it amanda gorman  wow
in one word magic this is americagreat 
 beautifully readv
funny how it takes a non politician to shed some light on the way of the world i guess only the innocent and clear minded youth can see the forest for the trees
people have been praying all over the world for me the usathe power of prayer is about to do something unusual so stay tuned
thats it china joe biden pander to minorities
wonderful and the right choice first lady bidento select amanada gorman youth poet laureate of 2017 to bring forth her powerful words that are just right for this timeand this young woman overcame a speech impediment rock on amanda
her hands dance graceful like a ballet i hung on her every word magical
yes notice the best singers their hands also dance in a similar way framing the note runs and melody/harmonies amandas hands *frame her ideals* its regal eloquent compelling
if she is our youth our future is assured
i had to really hold back the tears here this girl is talented and the fact that she is allowed to stand there that she is _invited_ to stand there is something we should never take for granted but cherish and make sure that someday that many more like her may stand in positions like this
fantastic

amanda gorman i shall remember your name because you nailed it in view of the past 5 years and an failed coop you put into words how our democracy is fragile but we stood up to the darkness and must learn from what happened and we must continue to grow as a people from it and so much more must be done to make the united states constitution more than eloquent words on paper it must embody all its rainbow of citizens so they can reap the rewards of life liberty and the persuit of happiness happy new day fellow citizens we deserve it
amanda i am 68 years old and i hope to live long enough to see you run and win as president of the united states your presence is so strong more than black girl  magic

where did they find 2 million crisis actors who were willing to die for nothing
052 america you great unfinished symphony i admit i find patriotism to be a nearly uniformally bad thing but i guess in something like this (as in the show it reminded me of) its par for the course
this resonates because it has gods truth all over it but everyone shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree and no one shall make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of hosts has spokenmicah 44 nkjv the hill we climb refers to who may ascend the hill of the lord or who may stand in his holy placepsalms 243  blessed 
being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into spot on 
that symbol is so called racist
then we created a slave market in libya
@sgt koranflusher yea everybody who doesnt agree or do what trump says is a traitorfrom the courts to the supreme courtshow convineint
@david owens no dummy marxism infiltrated democrats media and education as a platform to launch an attack on america a corrupt congress with republican sellouts the blackmailed and neocon traitors along with the judicial branches has aided them in the theft and election fraud the establishment stole this election for biden biden is their useful idiot of the day its the peoples right and duty to do something because there is no alternative in the courts the founding fathers expected this would happen and ensured that at least the people would have the 2nd amendment to help them our forefathers would still be at the capitol you are a traitor
@sonicnator the that last thing we need to do now that our republic has been stolen from americans by these globalist marxist interlopers is appease them they dont want to work with us no matter what they may say and it is to our detriment to try work them in any way there will be war or there will the hunger games scenario in america coming the way we react now decides this
@sgt koranflusher crazy statement like that are what caused some unhinged people to try to overthrow the government
@sgt koranflusher we have a destructive past indeed and we should be learning from it every day that being said we also have a past that we can look at as a source of inspiration
@sgt koranflusher and believe or not i share that same concern with you im no biden fan (quite conservative leaning actually) but i felt that much of what was said in this womans poem can and does ring true for americans of all stripes and political orientations we can learn a lot from this i hope biden does too
@tasneem alizerig you should be ashamed of your name after all the atrocities mohamed did to people in his day like murdering those poets who he didnt like or did you not know that mohamed was a murderer of poets it is written about quite extensively in hadith and by ibn ishaq in his book written in about 750 ad im sure the black poet we are all talking about here would love to know about mohamed sending his men in to slaughter one poetess in her bed asleep with her children as they ran their swords through them those are facts folksand you would all know it if you were taught your history correctly
@tasneem alizerig the book of peace what a freaking joke
but biden is just stepping all over the american past like the idiot marxist destroyer he is playing these days
this impacted me so much one of the most beautiful things ive heard
its not just her words but how shes speaking them her hand gestures eye contact facial expressions already a master of public speaking

yes indeed
@warrior tactical extended loop mopping the floors and mowing the lawn sounds good seniors his age need to stay active and get plenty of sun  )
@lucy renee i agree with much of your comment
@warrior tactical extended loop lol right
@warrior tactical extended loop right its so damned easy to hoodwink people especially when they are wading in the waters of denial the talk was indeed nonsense another distraction for those weaklings who believe/pretend that ignorance is bliss
@freeclimb word now that is a mic drop free climb() not the flowery words of that poem the girl is quite cute and was dressed nicely she looked absolutely adorable but she doesnt hold a candle to the (young) lauryn hill or tamika mallory  back in the day or today those who would speak truth to power (like lauryn and tamika or the likes of the late tupac) would never be allowed to grace the stage at an inaugural lauren hill and tamika mallory were/are powerful (and gorgeous) ladies who didnt/dont need to move their hands like theyre sign language interpreters or trying to cast a spell in order to get a point across via poetry or song this girls hand movements are far too excessive but im sure she thought if she packed the performance with lots of hand movement it would help that very mediocre speech  again she looked very cute people however the poem was not appropriate for the times we need to be real and inspire real change as anita baker said/sang in of her great songs no fairy tales this is not the time to soft shoe and tap dance
@emily rockefeller yeah yeah yeah em  im so immature i actually dare to criticize a public performance god knows thats almost never done lol why didnt you toss in racist while you were at it you of small brain youre a riot you lob nonsensical attacks at me all the while knowing nothing about me (and if you did know you might be embarrassed though as smug as you appear to be i doubt it) lets see to the noted moralist emily rockefeller any criticism however fair and credible it may be is picking on someone thus ems attempt to bully said critic into silence wont happen so save those little fingers btw amanda isnt even close to perfect
@mc i was wondering when the race card would be played lol for your edification id make the same observation if she were seventy and purple a performance is a performance
@emily rockefeller really thats your brilliant erudite comment well you will have the funniest comment of the day thats a certainty maybe the week with your bad punctuation em ill surely heed that asinine comment id mention colloquialism but it might get your brain allfried
@freeclimb and the rest of the commenters throwing mud right wing and a undertone of racism as that is the only reason to attempt to attack a brilliant performance you dont like the color of her skin diversity unity or equality you cannot appreciate excellence in creativity in expression because you do not understand it and whats worse you dont care to your mind is controlled by the right wing conspiracy theorist of fox news and trump summary your mind is gone your a foolish puppet and your dont even know it simply put your stupid enough to be manipulated by a con artist a fools comments have no value or merit to me 
@bitfire31337 there is still a constitution that says anyone has the right to express their opionion backed by science or not if thats how you chose to express yours thats on you
look whose accusiing someone of crying
if you want to see hand gestures and facial expressions with piercing eye contact hell all you had to do is have a conversation with my puerto rican grandmother now that is a woman that knows how to make her meaning clear
@mc i think you just made me throw up in my mouth
@warrior tactical extended loop like i said if you dont believe in god youll believe in anything
well coached id say a blooming marxist
@angel52 rofl yeah angel i can hardly function because amanda graduated from harvard just like i go on a daily admiration rant for what bc produced in aoc thanks for the biggest laugh of the day and thats saying something
@rmpsumma you forgot to add that shes also a harvard graduate sorry if it breaks your heart
@rulya morrigan ard mhacha lets try and replace opinions by actual science have a look at the following metaanalysis to the effect of immigration on employment it states that the consensus estimate of the decline in nativeborn employment following a 1 percent increase in the number of immigrants is a mere 0024 percent and the negative employment effect is also greater in europe than in the united states https//wwwresearchgatenet/publication/4789253_the_fallacy_of_job_robbing_a_metaanalysis_of_estimates_of_the_effect_of_immigration_on_employment
@bitfire31337 thats actually not true ins limits immigration to what our country can handle accommodate ppl coming in illegally even worse biden giving all 11 million plus more green cards unbalances our economy absolutely does take jobs from the unemployed americans who need jobs the us doesnt have an unlimited supply of jobs as it is bc of the rona there are even less jobs than there were a yr ago not only arent there enough jobs right now for americans already here we certainly dont have enough for 11 million more ppl plus more caravans biden has invited into the us the jobs that those over 11 million ppl qualify for are low skilled jobs which means far more competition in the job market for the poorest of our country its the poor who will get the most screwed over then the middle class bc thats whos going to be paying more taxes to support all of these unemployed ppl its simple 3rd grade math basic economics
@freeclimb thank you exactly these dem politicians leaders only use groups of ppl for votes to divide conquer i come from 2 marginalized groups that dems like to use for their narrative but i dont fall for it like the gullible easily manipulated ppl in this thread also look at what most of the ppl in this thread are saying abt amanda gorman theyre pandering appeasing like she just cured cancer these ppl think virtue signaling on social media is more important than ppls actual lives they dont care what fweedom headboard harris did to thousands of black men in california or that joe sniffy biden really is obviously blatantly racist virtue signaling feeds their ego thats all that matters to them they only think believe say do what their dem muppet masters tell them they have no critical thinking skills or independent thought they only know how to parrot that must be why denise can only repeat the same thing over over just like a parrot talk abt low iq id think shed be embarrassed repeatedly the same lame crap 15 times but shes not you just cant make this crap up these lefties are sad asf
@warrior tactical extended loop well first of thats not even true but one thing we know the religion of man (ie socialism/communism) certainly has between lenin stalin mao po pot castro and others have surpassed the death toll of all previous wars combined when you dont believe in god youll believe in anything
@mc do you actually listen to yourself its embarrassing
@mc moronic comment
@warrior tactical extended loop no worries my friend 
@warrior tactical extended loop whatever btw i wouldnt think you were cute if i were paid six figures to think so
@warrior tactical extended loop blah blag blah 
@warrior tactical extended loop really from what ive read of your comments youre not aristotle dyslexia or not
@warrior tactical extended loop you make a derisive (i understood enough to get that much) remark to me but im supposed to excuse it because youre dyslexic okay that makes sense
@warrior tactical extended loop lol my beef isnt with you
@rmpsumma im sure someone who spends their time writing out long drawn out paragraphs on youtube about how great they are is to be taken at their word this young lady reached more people with this one piece than you ever will in the entirety of your life and that kills you inside you have zero credentials all you have to offer are your believe me worthless assertions youre pathetic plain and simple
@warrior tactical extended loop unintelligible but i really couldnt expect more from you now could i youre funny though thanks for that
@freeclimb i really dont care thanks for the prayers though 
@denise my perfered pronouns are he/him but you got it
@juan garcia first of all are you actually saying addressing notables (hell little greta the smug did that even yelling to effect more worship) poise and presence are the only requisites which make one an above average public speaker thats asinine lets use someone im sure you hate as an example donald trump he spoke to notables millions in person and on tv he was poised and had presence but hes not even a good public speaker believe me i know more about public speaking than you could ever dream of knowing today too many people are impressed by very little i am not one of them her so called poetry aside you wont believe this but i could make her a much better public speaker not that shed allow it she thinks shes perfect because thousands like you tell her she is shes private school and harvard educated id think poise and presence would be reasonable expectations public speaking is an art pretty much a lost art
@freeclimb ohhh thanks girl i love prayer 
@denise well guess its not your fault then ill pray for you anyway
dude same i just bought a used car from this guy man was he good the eye contact hand gestures everything thing broke down and caught fire already but man could he sell im so glad to have met him
@freeclimb i was born without one  now go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
this calls acting just good acting
@lh sd i gotta note politely that theres an inherent flaw in your way of thinking about jobs and immigration people that come into the country do not only take someones job away they also live consume eat drink and some even found businesses with all that they also generate jobs high unemployment rates are not the result of immigration but of an overall improvable economy
she make satanic ritual
@denise seems your already crying just wondering when did you lose your soul or were you born without one
whatever dude shes just a young woman reciting a poem she has no greater insight to the inner truths of life than anyone else the fact she is willing to be used by a rascist pig that incarcerated 100s of thousands nonviolent black men tells me she has even less insight flowery words or not
@mc thats why i love the biden family they are remarkable people god bless this beautiful young lady with a healthy life and wisdom so we can continue enjoying her message
would trump or his people have had the intuition insight or wisdom to place such a creative talent like amanda on the world stage she is a representation of president bidens message of unity but also capability creativity and truth our new first lady dr biden apparently found her and placed on the world stage she shined and we all shined with her brilliant courageous and powerful
@rmpsumma ok snowflake
@rmpsumma she addressed an audience of millions who watched this televised an audience of presidents and political leaders who were present she did so with poise and presence if this isnt a showcase of her capacity as a public speaker what is

agreed that was a stunning and almost perfect display of poetry there where 2 or 3 very minor imperfections (minor misspeaks and small breaks in rhythm when swallowing) but that doesnt make it less great at all especially considering her age and the situation i probably wouldnt have brought even a single word over my lips
i agreeshe should make a living making speeches instead of making a living trying to run peoples lives
everything about her was just beautiful
she brought me into the moment absolutely awestruck yes every single thing about her is mesmerizing she is obviously a very special human being she is incredibly precious and i dont even know who she is but i know what she has a gift
@denise so am i denny baby so am i 
shes a trained seal
@rmpsumma go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@denise maybe you can read at an inaugural i know then id be moved to tears
so impressed by this girl she is a gift from god
@rmpsumma go cry somewhere else 
@denise original arent you lol
@rmpsumma go cry somewhere else 
i wish the camera had pulled back and stayed only on her i would have like to have seen all of it
@denise whos crying just the opposite
@rmpsumma go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
master (whoops poor word choice for the woke crowd  be careful ) of public speaking uh no to that
her words are beautiful and powerful however naive this is a utopian imaginary democracy shes speaking of its not real i wish it were
woooow she makes me proud to be part of black culture and hope for better world 
beautifully put
when americans talk about our best this is what will flash for me new dawn of yellow woven braids bronze skin the bright eyes of youth and poetry as a song of hope
@encore baby you have literally no idea of importance of literature at all we would all be living a very crude inhuman  materialistic life without art there is no such thing as human without art there would be no revolution without it have you not read one book in your life that made you think i guess you are just jealous 
@encore baby let her be poetry is way more important then what you think for some people
reminds me of the speaker in the hungergames
it was good the hand movements distracted me and the giant mics hid her face she should have also had a colorful scarf
and maybe a chained tiger crouched at her side
simply amazing beautifully recited so deep and profound shes so gifted its mindblowing wow wow
yes
what an amazing young woman to deliver such a message
i unfortunately missed this during the actual inauguration but my mom was so blown away by her that i had to come look for the video an incredible poem delivered by an incredible young woman 
cardi b and woah vicki has competition this girl is a good rapper
absolutely great
thank you universe for this wonderful creation out of your finest stardust
absolutely beautiful and inspirational
*and thats why she should be doing the next elder scrolls intro*
america america never changes
amazing
black greatness 
absolutely stunning
beautifully done
if the artist cannot find the way the way can not be found
she was simply awesome  and amazing
amazing she is
the last few lines are breathtaking
brilliant
i believe in america again
dancing lines
huh that made no sense
it sounded like she started rapping half way through ( 
and it was a fantastic speech
it sounded like she started rapping half way through ( 
@kaila hodgemcnutt go play with your lego toys and leave the serious thinking to us adults
so
american resilience
dont know which is more stunning her mastery of the english language or her beauty
amazing
beautiful there are no words what a beautiful indigo child
that much wisdom in a 22 year old lord 
cringe
shes to young and privileged to feel real lifethe greata thunberg syndromemind you she is intelligent
there is alway one in the crowd
bore off
shes very calculated from her words to her attire she cannot be lost in that somber sea
her tone too so powerful
shes amazing although this isnt poetry (i mean anything can be poetry but this piece feels a lot like a speech in rhymes (and rhyme doesnt neccessary mean poetry) with cliches and is very straightforward and its function is promoting the new president and uplifting people) and i cant not to feel weird about so much uncritical joy about politics and about any kind of party/organisation in charge with gazillion of funds and power (its somehow scary to me that these words here are supposed to represent it  also you cant really hate on these words because its common sense that democracy is good and so on)it is a special event but still no art for me here (i guess my expecations were wrong because everywhere it said it was poetry and i prefer different poetry)
those who dislikes this are in denial of themselves and humanity
that was absolutely beautiful and something for us as a nation to aspire to
this is beautiful what an eloquent intelligent young lady
perfection
dont lie to yourself your country is definitely broken and it is going to take a long time to repair it it is not only broken at the level of politics which completely polarized your country but also in terms of the economy where instead of raising the taxes for everyone you just print more money and put yourself in a larger and larger debt another fact is that your politicians are extremely corrupt and you all believe that they are so good and that they care about you no they dont they only want to be reelected and get even more money from the huge corporations such as facebook and twitter and all the huge banks that hate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they loose money on it since the monetary flow is not going through their accounts
welldoneamen 2021i understood it tho
sounds like a rap song she couldnt sell this was also used at her high school commencement event cant we ever get a white guy to give these types of poems well this really said nothing
illegitimate government shouldnt be recognized by anyone pay taxes accordingly
thumbdown haters why cant you just appreciate what is great
pretty words do not guarantee a roof over your head money in your pocket food in your stomach it doesnt reduce the cost of healthcare it cant bring back businesses lost during the pandemic it cant even guarantee that youll find employment within a week pragmatism is at an all time high because ceremonial nonsense cannot repair the growing political division economic despair that has afflicted this nation for quite a while having not given a thumbs down myself i thought id present that as a hypothetical argument take it or leave it
so articulate and elegant not a single error on her speech so special i also love how shes on bright yellow surrounded by dark colours as if shes the light on the horizon
americas vaclav havel
amazing
this gives me major hamilton vibes best part of the inauguration history has its eyes on her 
so corny
word salad full of hateful jabs and every woke cliche imaginable she is sewing division for future gains her hands make me dizzy
wow im speechless
what an amazing talented and gracious young lady surely the best of what america represents and can be what an absolute privilege to hear her 
whats so very sad is given enough time fox news oan newsmax rightwing media and congressional republicans would have half the country hating this young lady if she had been elected president or vice president
if you dont tear up when she says madam vice president you probably need to go get yourself a soul
absolutely incredible she is the future
thank you americans thank you america  i can finally breathe again slept this morning until 1130 so relieved youve had billions of us worried and under strain for four years your role on the world stage has always been a defender of democracy and high moral standards and thats how we like it welcome back  k rgds a/sweden
this self indulging spoken word bs is such a overdrawn caracter trope for so called young black leaders  its just here to check a box so leftist politics can check just another box (the young black sjw uneducated voters) dont believe the hype i was unimpressed by this so called inspiring speech
what a beautiful eloquent young womanhow i wish i had her gift with wordsthe world is your oysterskinny black girlx
shes incredible the world needs more youngsters with her wit and wisdom
her hands are amazing
she went to harvard free college for all
believe it or not the world already has a lot of incredible youngsters like her like amanda they just need a platform
david ignore all these crackheads replies i agree with you she was awesome
@maeu daou so what asian poets should i be looking for to find a similar speech at a presidents inauguration or at least something as important as this
soros grow in all the world satanic magicians
tears of joy such grace and brightness
very beautiful
she could have written the lyrics for tupac
finally a day filled with words of hope unity and love instead of violence division and hatred god bless america
native americans crying in tears
this most joyous edit and tragic moment in time encapsulated by a remarkably lucent wise and elucidating young woman that was awesome
comment section becomes transcription section

full transcript of amanda gormans inauguration poem the hill we climb mr president dr biden madam vice president mr emhoff americans and the world when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry asea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that will forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to her own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lake rim cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
beautiful words recited beautifully
i thought shes a rapper
@anomar namloh take a joke
@annalise clayton you have no idea what rap is or sounds like

if only abraham lincoln was able to see the brightness the he freed and martin luther king was alive to see what he inspired itll make out country heal faster
this is so beautiful
so beautiful and powerful
as a poeti wish i was this good
i did not like the poem guess that makes me a racist misogynistic islamophobic homophobic ignorant antisemitic bigot peasant
and therefore our noble people what is the transcendent superior wisdom for the sake of global humanity oneself and immortality according to the ancient secret chinese wisdom tradition what are the five kinds of the most prosperous most powerful knowledge and wisdom that every individual could and should possess paideia esotericsociety

future english literature students get ready to study this
as the death of art
i dont want to its awful
@james peter what did i say that was racist the race card is so convenient when you want to avoid intelligent discussion
@mario gil equity is not the same as equal rights you have no idea what you are talking about
@beatriz i cant but you have to try read more will help you
@santos portugal you cant do better than her so stfu she was great
@edita sevcikova why explain your point
@james patterson no
@deveon young come at me with an argument ill dumb it down for you even more than you already are
@deveon young you type like an unintelligible
@finn warner this is not acceptable level of poetry for an inaugurationpoetry requires experiences and depth and insightwe had robert frost we had maya angelou(i saw that one)now a fresh college student reading what amounts to be slam poetry
@jeff yeah idk
@finn warner this is a dumb persons concept of what a smart person sounds like
@giselle lopez gonzalez hahathis reflects the low level of american educationsorrybut this meatless drivel
already doing so
@estephany campos you are better off deconstructing brittney spearss oopsi did it again more meat on those poetry bones
already am 
@l mbg if the true poets from last century could hear this  poem theyd turn in their graves
@nick price no because youre clearly one of those teachers that tries to shove their ideology down students throats a lot of people like like you even punish students who disagree with you with a lower grade
@nick price so we should defer to your expertise
@hazel motes and theres nothing wrong with brittney spears shes not mozartsame with gormanpoetry that low iq ppl enjoy
@daphne van abswoude you should replace ancient latin and greek teacher to slam poet 59th street and broadway teacherthis has zero connection to excellence
@orionh3000 whywhat
@jeff yeah i literally do this for a living lol
@mike huntiches lol because i called biden a moderate that makes me partisan and selfrighteous come onnn man you dont know me
@nick price the world needs more partisan selfrighteous teachers like you
do follow me for some poetry ) @agratagupta
looooooooool
100%
i already have 
@hazel motes it sounds like you havent talked to someone in their 20s in about 50 years theres a huge emotional difference between about 20 (when gorman started writing her poem) and 24 and dylan thomass father was an english teacher so he grew up surrounded by literature and poetry if im honest i prefer gormans poem over the dylan thomas example you just listed in my limited class time in most cases id prefer to pick a poem that is intended to uplift furthermore while i am aware that many poets have tenuous personal lives unless the focus of the class was british poetry or similar if someone said hmm would you prefer to talk about an upandcoming feminist bipoc poet who got into poetry to help with an auditory processing disability and whose work was given a place of prominence at a presidential inaguration or would you like to talk about the early work of a white welsh alcoholic famous for his infidelity who essentially left his family penniless due to his alcoholism its clear whose work id prefer to showcase
@edita sevcikova unfortunately you are accurate in your assessmentthe 1962 inauguration poet robert frost vs 2021 inaug poet vacuous high school slam poet
@yomintyfresh i dont know about that heres dylan thomas twentyfour years remind the tears of my eyes (bury the dead for fear that they walk to the grave in labour) in the groin of the natural doorway i crouched like a tailor sewing a shroud for a journey by the light of the meateating sun dressed to die the sensual strut begun with my red veins full of money in the final direction of the elementary town i advance as long as forever is
this is not what english majors should study it saddens me that people are less and less receptive to the standards of literary expression in literary studies those standards are supposed to supersede any social discourse carried by a text which is why to this day we still study ezra pound to any english major this is mediocre slam at best a bit of _a la mode_ poetry with no historical significance whatsoever (im talking from a strictly literary point of view not a political one)
not jus english lit students a whole generation of student will study and absorb her message thats what really count
@oh no renlen and this is a good indicator of the inevitable decline of americait has begun a vacuous marketing fluff poem that is required assignment in school
@hazel motes yes you are missing the fact that young people often enjoy work produced by other young people and that gorman is clearly a shooting star (it would have been nice if harjo had been included in the inauguration too though) its also unfair to compare the work of women who (have) had almost 70 years to perfect their craft with the work of a 21yearold
read some ancient socrates this chick trash
@yomintyfresh i honestly do not get how this compares to wanda coleman or joy harjo i guess im missing something
@douglas adams perhaps the definition has changed when i studied english literature in high school it was literature born in the british isles
we have been since it came out 2 days ago
@hazel motes you doubt that anyone will be studying this a year from now im planning to include it in a class im teaching next year since you seen to be a flannery oconnor fan dont forget that the truth does not change according to [y]our ability to stomach it
@marko polo its not a bad poem because shes black adolf but at least its an improvement over traitor tot forcing us to read from mein kampf
i feel bad for them they are gonna be stressing out over an assignment with this poem lol
legit our teacher gave us an assingment due today on this
im literally doing an assignment on this right now9th grade english
@paris 54 well now who is shakespeare compared to the one above 
@hazel motes oh yes president kamilatoe harris and he comrades will make it compulsory
were literally gonna work on an assignment ab this today kskqhshqjsh
@purplestar123 yeah lets all be trashy racists and spit on america
@nick price a puppet for oligarchsread classics to understand
@hazel motes indeed its not maya angelou or robert frost but it was pretty nice
please we already are
hi watching this for honors english rn
we already did bruh
@paris 54 just one example poets who read at past inaugurations included maya angelou and robert frost ms gorman isnt at their level either i majored in english literature so im not ignorant this is not good poetry although theres nothing wrong if people enjoy it
@hazel motes if shakespeare was the only writer you studied in school you had a pretty terrible education
@paris 54 this isnt shakespeare
we did it already in 
@ same
@hazel motes who knows
@wew lad woops it seems like millions of english teachers are suddenly working at starbucks because apparently their degree qualifies them for this suddenly
@lindsay huff its not a poem just because a few words rhyme poetry only differs from prose in its use of heightened language thats not happening here
@paris 54 i doubt if anyone will be studying this a year from now
future english literature students get ready to make coffee for a living unless you are connected or not white
@hazel motes ummmmm you are joking right its a poem
my brother literally studied this yesterday
nah students have been brainwashed enough hey teacher live those kids alone
its not a poem its an essay
calm down you keyboard warriors
im doing it rn
what
we are already on it hahaah
@mary anna jackson the study of english literature focuses mainly on analysis debate and critical theorising about a large number of published works be they novels poems plays or other literary works that are written in the english language it isnt some celebration of britain but of the english language which is global
we are discussing it right know
for all its grammatical errors and nonsensical phrasesalso would be studied in poetry class
i hate this lady not becausew of her speech or ideals but the wave of assignments that is already headed my way because of her
@nick price cringe
kind of cliche though
@purplestar123 u were literally rascist saying social equity and equal rights which is a basic principal and calling it outrageous
my gorge rises
ikr i already am
@id just like to interject for a moment definitely everything should be based on competence
you mean propaganda
@purplestar123 im black and you are 100% correct racial equity hands people what they did not earn that is not how to achieve racial equality it will only perpetuate the cycle of victimhood
amanda is the daughter of my 6 grade english teacher lol
@brandyn beverly do you want to critique what i said or are you just here to insult
so very true
nah study chaucer and shakespeare b intelligent not stalinist brainwashed
we studied it today it is a work of art
i am an ancient latin and greek teacher and im already planning lessons around this
@purplestar123 i just love when intelligent people think they actually are
@truth seeker the problem with equity is its forcing equality of outcome rather than fostering equality of opportunity for one it does no good for the productivity of the economy and it also means that access to organizations businesses universities etc will no longer be based purely on merit but on the need to fill some quota based on gender sexual orirntation race or whatever group is disproportionately represented compared to the country population it is the assumption that unless every organization or position in the corporate hierarchy has a population which represents each identity group (in this case race) as directly proportionate to that of the general population it must be racist and discriminatory and affirmative action measures must be put in place
@purplestar123 okay then what is wrong with racial equity surely everyone benefits from a more just equitable situation
@truth seeker i didnt say racial equality i said racial equity the two are completely different things
@purplestar123 how is racial equality (i assume you meant that and not racial equity) the most flawed and ludicrous concept there is are you suggesting there shouldnt be equality in treatment of different races if so you pointing out nothing you said was racist is flagrantly untrue
why would one study this recitation in an english literature class english literature is the study ofliterature of the british isles not those who speak english
bruh my class is already doing it
@purplestar123 go cry somewhere else 
@water dubz 1) dont pull the race card its overused and tiresome there is legitimately 0 racism here where was i racist 2)he really didnt get me there 3)youre an idiot
@comrad wombat you didnt say pull yourself by the bootstraps you said strap your boots
@purplestar123 he got you there 
@purplestar123 yeah lets just be racist because of preconceived notions itll only come back to bite you in the butt )
@purplestar123 so pull yourself by the bootstraps doesnt really make any sense does it pull yourself up by your bootstraps its a common phrase in american political discourse particularly present in conservative rhetoric about selfreliance the concept is simple to pull yourself up by your bootstraps means to succeed or elevate yourself without any outside help but when you examine this expression and its current meaning it doesnt seem to make much sense to pull yourself up by your bootstraps is actually physically impossible in fact the original meaning of the phrase was more along the lines of to try to do something completely absurd thus this expression would make more sense if you strap (tighten your bootstraps) your boots and work hard if you want to accomplish success though from your comment somehow working as a barista isnt pull yourself by the bootstraps worthy
@comrad wombatwhat is strap your boots doesnt work for a job as a barista supposed to mean
@purplestar123 well you can try to correct me in order to make my comment great again
@comrad wombat i can tell you definitely dont study english by that incoherent sentence
@purplestar123 strap your boots doesnt work for a job as a barista
not from the states but if this poem its not taught starting at least in high school would be a terrible loss it gave me hope that things can and could be better all around it gives hope
@nick price a moderate democrat who just signed a bill for racial equity the most flawed and ludicrous concept there is
@purplestar123 a moderate democrat was elected the sky is falling
also get ready for adopting neomarxist pc agenda and working as a barista
literally sharing it with my students now lol
my teacher is giving m extra work because the way she presented the poem reminded him of how i did mine for school
agreed
webster dictionary doesnt have a definition to define your brilliance i cant find the words ill just say that was awesome
wow there are 20 activist or bots bickering through all this comment section to set a certain narrative how hilarious
im a 65 year young white man i have traveled the world this young lady is so on point and our nation needed to hear this true inspiration will go down in history she has made her mark i wish to thank her 
wow
it is people like this that make america great truly inspirational
let us prepare because schools gonaa make us a reflection paper about this piece 
the demonrats cheated and we all know it
absolute trash garbage
@john karpierz there is a wise saying you can give a person knowledge but you cant make them think some people want to remain ignorant only because the truth requires change good luck
@john karpierz hunka crap hanka virus snowflake what else
@hanks yeah well your side is full of bullies pal so stuff it hanka virus you guys deserve to be pushed around thats all you to do to us not such a good feeling is it snowflake
@john karpierz the difference between me and you is that we have different views but at least im not a bully on the internet
@john karpierz people like you are the reason theres division in the us rather being open minded you come here to criticize have you ever heard of phrase if you have nothing nice to say dont say it
@anomar namloh by the way these minorities elected a guy that was friends with a klansman and some segregationists he thinks blacks are dumb great job you had one vote and you all elected a dixiecrat
@anomar namloh you as well you seem to be full of false narratives
@hanks i did do my research the courts chose not to hear them hunka crap
@john karpierz and guess what all of these claims went to court and were rejected do your research dude so go on keep on believing why you believe
@john karpierz i i know a few people of color voted for trump my son and dil did keep repeating false narratives it doesnt make it true or truthful
@anomar namloh by using dominion machines using dead peoples names to vote and having non state residents vote there is a video of ballot stuffing letting people of color vote seriously are you that stupid dont you think non whites voted for trump
how did they cheat by allowing black brown and native americans to vote bless you with all the blessings you surly deserve
we just witnessed greatness
i m not american but this made me cry
most of this poem was complete nonsense lmfao so racist too she clearly only views herself as descendant of slaves does she realize that just about every race has been enslaved her ancestors were the main reason they were enslaved in particular because her great great great great grandma sold her kid to slaves because she was too broke stop saying we need to step into the past we need to step into the future and stop making this about identity politics especially when joe biden is the most racist president in modern day history
beautiful but americans need to stop the shining city on a hill nonsense democrat or republican president  their policies towards poorer nations and those who have resources that america wants does not change a typical superpower not a unique one
amazing
the schmoyoho remix of this is going to be tight as an occasional writer of and fan of poetry this is awesome worthy of academic study seriously amazing structurally and emotionally im very impressed
she makes suprematists appear neanderthals
absolutely breathtaking everything about her and her poetry wow 
wow
im australian and ive watched this 3 times so beautiful
eloquence step aside heres amanda gorman
bravo
both sides are as corrupt and evil as each other the democrats believe they are the divine light coming to cleanse and heal the us the us a country rotten to its core generations of patriotic brainwashing and 24/7 polarising biased media has created a country of gullible narcissistic citizens i am absolutely baffled that democrats believe anything is going to change and that the country will miracleously mend itself these people are figure heads smoke and mirrors prevails again
great and loaded message loved love it
profound
im not even american and i nearly cried from how beautiful this is

amanda gormans inaugural poem the hill we climb when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
thank you 
omg thank you for typing this now i can take my time to memorize this beautiful amazing poem from a inspiring amazing young black beautiful and proud young woman

this is hope personified thank you
i really enjoy the poem and the girls presentationa nd lookce however the hand gesturing seemed a bit muchtoo theatrical that should have remained toned down considering the event less is more
im not an american but hellshe did made me cry a bit that was beautiful funny what words can do trump had the best word according to him self but she she was so above trump and one of the best speaches weve heard in the last 4 years
yeyso back to more neoliberalism and still the usa is nowhere near being a democracy you see  all the oligarchy needs to get the people back in line is some total moron wannabe dictator for 4 years and then the people forget that they actually wanted a democracy and a govt that worked for them and represented them and is completely satisfied with more oligarchy capitalism usa is still the pitiful least civilized least developed least educated most unhealthy most exploited  country in the developed world  and doesnt look like its going to gain any rankings anytime soon on those listsoh well at least we dont have trump right
what an elegant mastery of words mesmerizing it in its tone captivating in its fluency breathtaking in its depth but everlasting in its influence words that depict the current situation and envisions a beautifully untold future amazing

too bad thats how you feel peter pan my will save us i believe there is less evil today than yesterday and less and less each day
history has its eyes on us the scripture quote i smell hamilton inspiration
@fitrikhalifa02 a founding father linmanuel miranda wrote a very amazing musical based on his life and there are what seem to be references to the play in her poem ^^
@fitrikhalifa02 here is the hamilton musical soundtrack which has everything you need to know https//youtubecom/playlistlist=pl3e0jlen9xhanichqryvsgnwehfrlln8t **disclaimer though it is an adaptation of history into a musical so not evvveerrything is historically accurate but it is a fun and good intro to alexander hamilton it is from this musical in which the inspiration came from for some of the quotes gorman used
i mean who is hamilton
@rebecca rahi yes she told manuel and cited him on twitter
yes i was looking for this comment v strong hamilton influences 
thank you
yesss and the fig tree part i was like hold on this is hamilton speaking
it was
far from polished far from pristine but yet able to produce gems as this there is hope for america

thats very powerful wisdom absolutely amazing lady

more than the beautiful words of this beautiful young lady i am impressed by the amount of ignorant facist bigots in the web still supporting the most corrupted immoral and ignorant liar that has ever been sworn into office in the united states amazing the us need healing and needs it fast what a great job destroying america mr trump now your buddy putin must be so proud ps i know im not american and i dont even live there but us and its people has all my sympathy and solidarity
never have i rolled my eyes so much
the highlight for me truly amazing with the name gorman she has got to have irish ancestry so along with president biden we are claiming her as one of ours   
@flre facts are facts 
yeahhhh we dont want her lol stop making every american seem irish 
yeah umm no
haha wot blarney  wakanda forever 
if trump is watching this nowhe must be very angry to see this woman reciting a poemhe was a president without wisdomhe acted on power of position not common sense that is not common
congratulations biden  but honestly i rather deal with the devil i know than an angel i dont know his agenda for the united states well its a new year with bright and beautiful ideals  hope youll got a huge list for this 2021  coz last year was messed up due to many werent wise enough to consider investment  but the question what will you achieve this year

beautiful words bravo
everyone is obsessed with the slavery that ended in the us 150 years ago which ended because thousands of white american men fought and gave their lives to end it they hashtag it tweet it share it post it all on the smartphones that are made by literal modern day slaves the irony and the idiocy forget about fighting a bloody war to end slavery these hypocritical virtuesignaling hive mind degenerates wont even give up their iphones you people make me sick with contempt
@werds im a woman bro
bro we are talking about the concept of white supremacy not white people
did biden run over and sniff her hair
africa heard you too
very strange  shes black sobshe suppose to love trump  trump gave jobs for lots of blacks 
dont get me wrong im very happy trump has gone but this pretentious oprah show saccharine painfully worthy sixthformer rambling is just embarrassing if this is the keynote for the biden presidency then americas not out of the woods yet
@coco d well lets see how long it takes biden to become as hated as trump
@derek spitz the best recommendation would be to move because what you seek will never become fruition in your lifetime or minesor you can choose to run for a political position make a change yourself
@coco d  if everyone had your stance on life everything would be stagnant and what exactly is my stance on life i hate trump i worry for america because of destructive polarisation and a seeming inability of people to think critically and for themselves my opinion is that a massive swing to the left now would be damaging when what the us needs is certainty and stability while ensuring fairness and equality of opportunity for everyone not this melodrama and hyperbole and inauthentic backdated bloodletting that is in its way as bad as trumpism let me put it in terms that you might understand trump = bad woke dogma = bad neomarxism = bad proud boys = bad antifa = bad us foreign policy =bad misogyny and misandry = bad crt = bad us health system = bad us gun laws = bad do you see
everyone knows america is not out of the woods thanks to trumps administrationa real setback has been implementedbut if everyone had your stance on life everything would be stagnant everyone should throw their hands in the air and say forget about a brighter future because not one generation has learned from the previous before this is life you have to live it if you want to wallow in your dispirited disposition that is on youi choose to forge aheadand join the oprah show yet not being naive but apprised of what is and in control of what i allow to influence mehave a good day
@derek spitz your original comment is perfect
@coco d can you not read im no fan of trump but neither am i an idiot who believes in a politically binary world where you are either with us or against us listen life is much more nuanced than that and youd do well to get your head around that i am not your enemy smh
now now trump go to beddont make youtube find out youre on herego on git
amazing
power filled words of the love of the holy holy spirit delivered by a young woman who clearly sees
who are the miserable 32k who disliked this powerful brilliantly brought message of hope forgiveness and unity
shes precious and endearing a beautiful writer and speaker she is lovely great job young lady
to bad she said it was a domacracie instead of a republic
but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated simple and yet so powerful
@encore baby example please
so there is still hope for the russian turkish saudi chinese etc people
@snore lax you were always the crappiest pokemon anyway
@snore lax projecting again should we talk about voter suppression at all hmmm
tell that to the chinese
in next 10 years nothing will change for blacks in usa remember that
finally some truth in the comments section they voted for this screw em
great wisdom and understanding shes awesome always
in her i see myself thank you
shes from cincinnati ohio another liberal racist black person typical cant wait cause the movie is not over 
wow
its alright
my heart indeed
listening to her right makes my heart ache a bit i dunno its just the speech or her beautiful lady 
glorified rapper
you cant find light when gods missing the nation is destroyed because of election fraud and turning to communism wheres the constitution that these devils make an oath to protect these swine will destroy anything decent america is not a democracy fools it is and always has been a constitutional republic
3200 down votes from despicable trumpers who dont get it so sad
gave me goosebumps americans and the world when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry asea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that will forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to her own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lake rim cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
so beautiful said for all people in moving forward 
her creativity and powerful meaningful words are unbelievable
we lift our gazes to not what stands between us but what stands before us (gorman) wow powerful and truthful statement what an inspirational writer 
she was perfect at spewing mainstream media propaganda exactly why these corrupt establishment politicians picked her
wow
simply amazing
3
simply beautiful a message of hope and how a nation should be
the 33 k ppl who disliked this need psychiatric evaluation
no everyone who cryed for this does
this young woman is incredible we as a country needed to hear this at this particular time in history awesome
@bplincoln1982 why you know nothing about my classes or my learners seriously id like to know what has triggered a feeling of pity in you please share with the group
@derek spitz i pity your students
@derek spitz i totally agree with you just giving the young lady her props and hoping her poem would inspire love and peace in america god bless you

@encore baby you are correct i just was giving the young lady her props nothing will help this country but the love of jesus christ in peoples hearts until then god bless you
@cheryl williams amanda wrote and read out a fair poem as a college english and creative writing lecturer i see teenagers do this all time sometime to this standard sometimes better (often not) some people are gushing about amanda today for political reasons not because of her poem and the bidens attitude towards here is patronisingpatting the politically expedient little black woman on the head for her performance that will hopefully ingratiate the uberwhite president and his arrogant wife with black voters seems to be working
she was the true star today
beautiful america  just beautiful 
meh
@british royal school he already did
can you do it better
im a retired marine and i have listened to this about 20 times now this is what this country needs and her words is exactly how i feel and think this country should be when you actually served and love this country it makes you feel a certain way because you know that this country can be better for all if we all step up and stop trying to devide and help build bridges 
im a british veteran and ive watched it over 10 times this lady has shown the world that the usa is still an example and leader to the world
i once believed like you did but sadly this country will continue to care for the rich and powerful first and foremost
trump 2024
thank you for your service 
why she dressed in communist china colors yellow aint on our flag ruined a good poet
can someone send me the lyrics
get this girl in front of a crowd
she is awe inspiring how could 3k people give her a downvote
social media said this was the best thing of today its below average b trying to manage never again present always searching
your poetry is bad and you should feel bad
to me this was the highlight of the inauguration i wish i would be alive to see her one day become the potus in 2036 you go girl 
great
stunning and brave
amanda for next president
wow
look at our daughter america she is wondrous courageous and brilliant she is the exemplar of whats to come god bless her and everything she represents
to all of you who decided to add hate speech on this thread or as a comment to this speech you are the hill we climb
@kevin maguire i remember a time when the right accused the left to using racism like a weapon i see that youve made peace with that oh or are you accepting racism only when its again whites (im not saying that amanda was racist i just making the assoption thats what youre sayin)
@orionide this is why we often speak about systemic racism but im sure that you are aware of this im puzzled who do you stand for  the only politician that can fit your description is sanders but since hes supporting blm and civic rights since well always that cant be him are you talking about trump  if so wow youre so off
more racial divide while the rich have gotten extremely rich and now work hand in hand with the government but yet they put the blame on the populace division benefits those big players because it removes the attention off of them good job idiots racism is only a problem when its state sponsored because a racist farmer has 0 effect over your life
courageous how so because ive seen true courageousness
just another waste of life
she should have spoke more about white privilege and blm
@wnrc ltv i guess there is not hope for everyone
this comment made me cry just beautiful
shes very good at spewing mainstream media propaganda ill give her that great speaker
@still cheeky see people like you bring negativity into our everyday lives how about you leave with your negativity )
if the democrats had her way she wouldnt be here she would have been an abortion
yaaaaas
oh yes she gives me hope
and that ladies and gentlemen is black girl magic
there were many amazing moments today but amanda gormans poem was the highlight for me every word every stanza every intonation every rhythm and every meaning was flawless absolute brilliance that made me cry tears of hope and joy
so admit america isnt racistshe is speaking and she is blackamerica isnt racistjust stop with the race baiting you are the one destroying our country with this speech sorry but its this ideology thats hurting america
bro im not even american but look how far america had gone from seperating black and white to a black girl delivering a poem in front of america and its president awesomeeeeeeeeeee
wait shes my age time to have an existential crisis i guess
age has nothing to do with talent you could peak at 13 you could peak at 63 you could peak at 33 or 53 definitely only a number that ends in 3 though  p
i would trade 1 million trumps for just one of her shes the better in all of us
@jasper siebelink stfu
@fabian ortega 12 your comment proves her words are just an eloquent version of the same orange man bad propaganda weve had to listen to the last four years
well obviously 1 million trumps would be a disaster
better at what reading a poem
yeaaahhh
democrats are evil people that let idiots who ruin our country into the us
you guys are taking a poet way too seriously
@jasper siebelink theyre not worth much
throw in all republican politicians and most democratic ones as well
all the trumps in the mult verse
id trade the other 170 million trump supporters too
those who disliked this were watching the video while their phones were upside down
america is a messed up country american still celebrating their country as if the last 4 years did not happen the last 4 years have showen what the real america is
nice poem given political context but did i hear a reference to her aspiration to be president dont see her as a poet the great poets or philosphers no interest in such a job and power they focus on much bigger picturebeyond democrat and republican they think earth and the universe and a purpose for humankind she should consider politics as her future and now she has fame lol no artist philospher poet ever achieved much unless they were alone unknown and in pain) would have preferred to have seen a bright young woman or manor oldor in between(dont care if black white asian etc)in rags come to podium and speak about the big picture issues the human race faces that supercedes all the symptoms we see playing out but as we all know that would never happen we dont talk about the mega issues and focus on the symptoms which end up dividing us
im not crying damn it that was beautiful so happy there are human beings in the white house again 
#chicomtraitors 
33k people who still stand in the shade
*biden is americas disgrace*
absolutely fantastic
amazing just amazing
trump has his supporters the rest of us have amanda gorman
this is the importance of education this young queen was discovered by dr jill biden im impressed by her first decision   pure magic
@lunch its called the bigotry of low expectations its a liberal mindset
youre right she was perfect pick by jill she spewed all the mainstream media propaganda very poetically
dumb hater
@julie kouirat dont worry some people just dont have the ability to see the importance and significance of certain events such as this particular performance
@lunch you utter clown she wrote it
dood she just read a poem it doesnt mean anything even rappers write poems
just listening to her you get chills and are showered with confidence
this is the era of just redemption god please let it be so
@sgt koranflusher uhhuh fraud that was so obvious that trump couldnt manage to prove it in even one of more than 60 court cases heard by over 90 judges many of whom were conservative republicans appointed by trump himself the only one who tried to steal this election was trump fortunately democracy prevailed sorry that you believe so many falsehoods must feel pretty bad
you just had you election stolen through obvious fraud and have been told that you will be under martial law with endless lockdowns mask mandates and forced medical procedures with untested poisons by biden your doom is coming and you will see more endless wars including wars inside the usa
this is what a true leader looks like someone with passion and love for her people her words inspired a nation
bars someone edit this and put a beat to it
this girl is going places
graceful
@amandagorman we appreciate you we can close the divide my hope too is that love becomes our legacy thank you 
go to hell if you could of heard her poem and disliked it this is so moving
shes a communists and theyre not about democracy or peace
i awoke this morning feeling hopeless even though it was the inauguration of a new administration i was broken with prompting of a friend to watch the inauguration and there she was with her collection of words giving the hope necessary to overcome my darkness her words are what our nation needed to encourage us to find solutions i feel better
 i couldnt help but tear up 
those 3k people who disliked why didnt the virus get to you first
bc we didnt wear a mask duh
they probably just dont like biden and it was his inauguration regardless the poem was beautiful
new age
im trying to find a line to quote from this to end an essay but literally every line is quotable
@encore baby in the context i think she means the monster of totalitarialism chaos violence and war that threatened to gobble up the country on 1/6 but thats just my interpretation she could just mean a very hungry caterpillar 
@encore baby are you asking or trolling
we braved the belly of the beast
ill be honest i wasnt really that impressedthe poem sounded like the dribbles of what she is a young 22 year olda few lines showed brilliance which speaks to her potential but overall to me at least feel short of the mark
try your best to find a poem that is better about our country
lovely reading
god knows everything
there was more eloquence in that 5 minutes or so than every speech given the last four years by the previous administration technically she isnt a part of the new one but you know what i mean
easy as there hadnt been any grain of eloquence in the insignificant grunt of the entire previous administration
i predict she is about to be catapulted into a brilliant streaking career arc over us alland she will help turn the darkness into light 
i enjoyed and listening to her poetry she has such resonate in her speaking voice
disgusting fraudulent inaugeration
which one trumps or bidens
amazing absolutely amazing her way of using the spoken word is as a balm for the soul and the message too 3
future potus
this poem is a splitting image of perfection
now thats the proper way to use ones hands when addressing an audience
shes amazing it would be great if a group of famous singers including lady gaga be able to produce a song from this poem
you have words of a free democrat visionary just as we new democrats and liberals in canada would mostly sympathize to we hope that all the wrong done will be reversed and mr trump seeks help becomes a changed man does business with integrity and respects others who are wiser than himself to much more significant levels
outstanding grace and inspiration now mean something totally different it means amanda gorman
are the hand gestures necessary in reciting poetry
yes
yes its the classic rhetoric style
shes a inspiration 
*an
lowest unemployment rate highest economic growth at least 30% compared to obama 10% highest stock market growth and lowest poverty rate in 2019 and everything hits rock bottom due to kung flu mainstream media blm antifa and liberals when it comes to warfare and diplomacy usa withdrew troops from middle east left iran deal and bombed that iranian general without any collateral damage and iran didnt do shit because theyre scared of trump and he met that fatso dictator of north korea its hard to admit it but trump might be the best president usa ever had good luck with your new president i heard hes planning to legalize 11 million illegal immigrants and imagine how many real american citizens will lose the opportunities to find a job just hoping biden wont die during his term usa cant have a communist indian woman leading a great country and plans to defund the police 
@ping ng capiz hmmm your confusing me you said blm caused riots but they were just mad black people were mad because the police were killing them just because of their skin color the white people rioted the capitol too and im almost positive the united states isnt broken but it is incomplete
@oofologyy bs poetry united stated aint broken really look what blm and antifa did to your country riot lootings etc only fools wil believe in blm movement its a scam run by liberals and democrats
trump tried to pardon himself he wanted to build a wall between a country we were allies with and so much more i wouldnt say he is a horrifying president but he is definitely not the greatest nothing hit rock bottom these 4 years but things could have been handled so much better we lost almost 600k people due to a virus that could have been handled in 4 months instead it has now been a year blm is an amazing thing that did not cause anything to hit rock bottom african american people should have rights and i disagree with most of this comment
this is a poetry video about our country this is not saying trump is horrible it is just beautiful
quiet isnt always peace
is she signing
holy moley incredible
a poor oppressed little girl saying a poem at the highest reception in the world biden leached forward at the end i wonder did he want to go sniff her seriously

dr biden hahahaha
@kozodoev ya right my money is on a ged for you
@kozodoev i am not as impressed with her ridiculous degree as you are it is not that hard to get a professor degree when your husband pays to play but you continue your love fest pretty sure you are a high school grad right
@oofologyy not really
@dena kane a professor that is a hard job to get
@kozodoev but yes i do have a ba
@oofologyy hahaha she is a teacher with an over rated/ useless degree
dr biden is his wife

the republican party will be dead party by 2064 america is a melting pot of races cultures and religions
soooo youre saying that you hate white ppl and youre celebrating their demise got it
wow beautiful words in hopes of a beautiful world 
dear mr trump this is what it looks like to know words and have the best words
democrats has the culture of the changing america the republicans hate us for that republicans are jealous for that the republican party is a dying party by 2064 
the bar was so low the last 4 years its time to bring it back up to where it belongs

phenomenalso eloquent
https//youtube/vmubjgqjuvm
this was so bad it put me off watching any more of the inauguration seriously was that a real poem im only asking because it was bad like cheese bad horrible
@hikma warrior you should have at least listened to all of bidens speech but to each their own
future president  a poet

like like like
im sorry but what kind of pathetic losers would give this a thumbs down and why
im i the only one who voted for trump but didnt really care that he lost  im interested to see how a democrat white house operates
interesting i think maybe you are
dont you love millenials 
if people only knew that this adminustration lives on division
projecting again to the privileged equality feels like injustice
if only you could write
that is how we begin to heal

out of the mouths of babes wisdom flows
amazing she gives me chills
flawless
as a poet from africa kenya this is an inspiration to many of us that yes we can and our time is at hand gogogo amanda
what the hell is there to dislike about this video some of yall are just randomly disagreeable for the sake of being disagreeable 
the dislikes are haters and cant comprehend truth this is what happens when the uneducated dont know the words are speaking about people and america
theres always light if only we brave enough to see it if only we brave enough to be it
yes we need to be it forget the dirty politicians what is important is what is going on in my house in my house i welcome all god fearing people that will treat other as you wants to be treated god bless our country
she has a mastery of the sound of words that makes them bounce off each other like slam dancers
it sounds exactly what i hear from the mainstream media i can see why the political establishment used her
i see a lot of narcissism
@josh kirkwood great ) thanks for clearing that up
@teslastellar oh  yes i was being facetious thank you kindly for reminding me i can never find my original comment
@josh kirkwood you said rather suspicious wouldnt you say
@teslastellar hm what suspicious part that was beautiful beyond words what more needs said
@josh kirkwood hope the suspicious part was you joking
@teslastellar yes difficult indeed she spoke well for someone who supposedly had a speech impediment hm rather suspicious wouldnt you say stupid fux
she spoke well something we have been deprived of for four years
@teslastellar i had the same speech impediment until a couple months ago very happy for her overcoming it in adulthood feels like such a massive weight lifted off your shoulders
hard to believe that she had a speech impediment for many years
this women loves hamilton
imagine reading this poem in 9th grade english class in 2089
a beautiful and talented girl blinded she will have a lot of disillusionment in her life i pity her with all my heart she sounds sincere poor little fool
the people who disliked cant even articulate why they dislike it
racist
god bless her just think if every child going through public education was afforded equal opportunities resources what amazing gifts would be uncovered young people made whole with sights of helping to change our world for the betterment of all generations
quiet isnt always peace 
wow
somewhere in the philippines a southerner is shaking that one day his tyranny will end when ynang bayan opens my fellow yndios eyes
joe swore in today hail to the thief
divine
i will learn this with all my hearth
not the president
@kaylah  maree not mine communist
you are correct she is not biden is
very delighted to hear this once in a lifetime poem you have a tremendous talent  
it was ok shes very pretty though(shrug)
your are not my president no 46th trump is my president 
this portrait of america will never surrender to be white washed 
very touching and burn the spirit to strive and stand up and work in unity beautiful poem that is full of inspiration
quiet isnt always peace wow how true was that all the bigots and the narcissist came out the woodwork last 4 years they were just hiding sitting idle when times were quieter before the manchild took over
the gleaming input jekely divide because phone suggestively stay at a voiceless footnote vagabond keen slipper
she is an absolute beauty
beautiful  she did amazing on that platform
i expect over 1 million views by tomorrow
my sense of relief for having survived the fouryear nightmare goes more palpable by the hour

weve learned that quiet isnt always peace 
just wow shes fearless
3100 dislikes but i see no negative comments cowards
sort by newest first youll find them
she made me proud to be born and live in america  
cringe haha
scripted and choreographed and a speech read from a teleprompter  it felt and sounded phony
i just love it 
just wow mr president dr biden madam vice president mr emhoff americans and the world when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit  its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our enaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy in change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the winds swept north east where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerinsed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it (*just slight editing from a previous kind poster that originally transcribed this)
this may sound crazy but after seeing how stunned even famous men were for the first time i saw how profound the link is between words and leadership
without a doubt this profound link between word and leadership should be etched on every would be leaders mind
bro what 
we seek harm to none and harmony for all mmm
she must get awesome grades in english 
man she was spittin god bless her and the united shaytes who remember when trump said shaytes instead of states

@k mt i can say what i want as long as im not insulting anybody if you dont like it you can go somewhere else  have you ever heard of something called freedom of speech looks like you are one of those corrupt governors children or payed handyman wanting to keep your wealth thats what it sounds like to me such a statement can only come from a person whose mind is filled with greed and carelessness im glad everybody can read what you wrote this is what we have living in this country america read carefully what this man wrote this is what a traitor looks like
@germangirl dont vote wrong platform we dont care about your rant and your conspiracies
@luna stark what you really mean is that she was and is so stellar that there was nothing you could pick on however you decided to go for her hair even thought there is nothing wrong with it but in your head it is a way to put her down why let me guess thats not your hair type in conclusion this young lady is above and beyond anything you could possibly imagine being she conquered a speech impediment recently has 3 books coming out just wrote and recited this amazing poem at the presidential inauguration the entire planet woke up praising her and is going to run for president when she is old enough to qualify what have you done lately
@luna stark just trivial appearances pay attention to the words and meaning of a wonderful poem
@germangirl dont vote why dont you try to do something positive can you do any better (donald trump lied about everything) if you want to be mad be mad at himsmh
@luna stark *youre now go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@germangirl dont vote go cry somewhere else girl were enjoying ourselves over here 
@luna stark go cry somewhere else luna were enjoying ourselves over here 
@luna stark jealous
@germangirl dont vote again you are stuck in the superficial nonsense of the culture that is detrimental to any group of people many of the most accomplished people went to the same school as everyone else who cares about who picked her clothes or did her make up who cares why is such a shallow way of looking at life matters to you i guarantee if you practice for 10 years you will not be able to compose such profound message of love and unity yet not deviated from realities and full of pragmatic guidance to achieve excellence and healing that should be your focus get off watching springer show and get some education thats for your own good
@germangirl dont vote sorry if my comment insulted you we could all use a little help im getting mine i just hope you get yours i know the pandemics real because i know people who got the disease and died i had it myself if you dont believe welldocumented evidence from medical professionals and scientific journals go to your local hospital and get the stats from them
@luna stark she does she keeps saying shes enjoying herself so how she surround yourself with people that go against her if she constantly have to tell everybody that she would enjoy herself
@bookoobeans well thats strange my best friend is a social worker and she agrees with me 100%  so maybe you need to go to seek help for yourself  obviously you need it because all you gave was insults and you didnt put a single fact on the table dont you think of this as a very controlling( out of fear and paranoia) behavior(or trying to be ) so please next time you respond put facts on the table especially when it comes to my claim that we are not in a pandemici hope i am talking to an adult
@honest radical how is she amazing when she went to school like everybody else practicing for a speech for months and somebody picking out her clothing and do her hair youre right thats amazing
@germangirl dont vote suggest you contact a social worker and get some mental health counseling engage with the world again even though it isnt perfect
@denise you spam this on every comment your cringe  get a life
@denise u not enjoying yourself if you have a hundred people in other comment sections that going against you give it to you you put on quite a bit of effort though 
@luna stark go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@germangirl dont vote go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
it sickens me that this amazing lady is giving us the most powerful message during the most vulnerable times and you superficial morons are talking about her appearance just stfu and listen to the message you may leave the streets culture and become a contributing member of the society
@luna stark she wears her hair 100 different ways maybe you can call her for something that is more your fancy jesus christ its so hard for some people to just give a little encouragement
her hair looks crappy tho 
disgusting display of a paradeinstead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
@mda m you got pretty and petite in the 60s
@jelly bob shes so pretty and petite
the poem was mesmerising but damn i like her hair smh
great to see young artists get a platform
its great but unfortunately her beautiful poem is forgetting that nothing will change until we admit we always have a sin and morality problem in this worldnot until we admit without jesus nothing changes
beautiful i cant help but think her hands must have been freezing
breathing taking 
she will be president in the next 20 to 25 years from now such a beautiful mind and soul
we can only be light in christ  i hoped to have heard that only
@suzette van der merwe i get that but most people dont understand that one day perhaps a special soul will be bold enough to specifically lift up christ
beautiful and magical
because its your time powerful and peaceful with purpose you knocked it out of orbitthank you
this young lady deserves respect shes very well spoken it almost felt like i was listening to maya angelou she has a bright future we are all one race god made us in his likeness we are all his children thank you ms gorman

@verslalchimie anderson cooper told her he wants to attend her inauguration he seemed smitten 
please i want to live long enough to see her be president twice
she said she might run someday
very impressive
0
a hymn to hypocrisy
to envision that everyone should sit under their vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid wow well said
can you please explain the meaning of that line looks like from bible to me thanks
@ihuoma joshua thats from micah 44
ritual poem for the evil ones
um what
people like her deserve to be in power not some privileged person who bought and paid his /her university degree and shoved down our throats into the political scene a congress number or a senator or a judge that rule the country generation after generation its time for the real thinker to be the decisionmaker not the children of the elite few
wow amazing amanda powerful poem
wow this lady is amazing
this is such a joke
poem not joke similar to your eyes maybe but indeed two different things
im not american but i wouldnt have missed this for anything what a queen 
@uniquely tia lmao we just talked about her in class then did a graphic organizer about what was the purpose and subject of the poem and stuff like that if they gave me a speech to do i wouldnt do it lmao 
@dylan we had to write a whole speech
@uniquely tia never mind we just watched it friday at school and we have to do a graphic organizer on her poem
@dylan oop well i go to school in the us but im indian maybe it depends on the grade or the teacher my teacher is pretty strict lol
@uniquely tia im american and we didnt even have to watch this for school
@uniquely tia by far the best part her words restored my hope
im american and im glad other parts of the world are able to see this gold although running away isnt best answer ive contemplated moving to a different country its the bright inspiring and intelligent people like this that give me hope and continue to fight for equality and what is right
im filipino and this was touching
@uniquely tia she was amazing to watch
im indian i had to watch this for school and this was the best part of the inauguration
likewise im irish and i was very happy to witness greatness
beautiful
they pulled every propaganda scheme available almost made it look like an app to school special
preserve our heritage
congratulations 
astounding
wau beautiful 
shes literally shining in that sun
@louise e so youre saying im jealous that amanda is pretty smart and (moderately) successful as a poet firstly im not a woman so why would i be jealous of her looks (if anything i find her quite attractive) secondly i like smart people (which i doubt you are) thirdly im successful in my field (i have absolutely no desire to be a poet) if my disagreeing with you has triggered you my apologies but do you really expect everyone to agree with you all the time yes you probably do smh thats one of the tenets of woke puritanism
@derek spitz because shes beautiful intelligent and successful if you werent you wouldnt have gone out of your way to argue with people who are complimenting her
@louise e of what exactly
@derek spitz youre jealous 
@daniel curry you do know the blm is a front for neomarxists who in reality dont give a hoot about black lives what i suggest you do for a happier and more productive life is to stop seeing the world through the prism of race and stop pinning your personal identity on the colour of your skin guess what lifes a bit*ch for most people regardless of the colour of their skin
born to hand jive  baby
her poem made no sense 
its just the mustard jacket
@daniel curry yes i dont undertsnad why judge smeody based on amount of melanin in skin such weirdos
those who have the negatives comments are jealous and ractist and madbut guess we as blk people are on riseand nun can be done about itso keep on with your racist and negative and mean commentsit doesnt even matter no morecause blk people are on the rise20202028 biden/harris/warnock/ossoffthey are going to make america great again
@derek spitz the mans right its just science lmao not racism
@heritance activate and elevate also i wish i couldve seen that other guys comment sounds like it was hilariously stupid
@water dubz literature* ironic word to get wrong(im not involved in this fight just thought this was ironic xd)
@giavannie gianguzzi least i have basic litterateur skills go date your sister old man
@giavannie gianguzzi and im latin american and its water dubs lol old white man cant read lol
@giavannie gianguzzi you cant even read lmao this is rich and i dont have to be black to see that you view the world through rumors and false notions but please continue to speak to me through your echo chamber maybe youll finally believe your lies for the 4000th time
@giavannie gianguzzi elaborate please or are we resorting to generalizations and biased assumptions again
michelle i thought she outshines the sun
and im 21 and still have acne
@heritance smh
@derek spitz also she was not sweating in 30degree weather
@derek spitz projection my statement is true racism is a cast system that a certain nation created in order to feel comfortable
@heritance racist
its called melanin activation the sun is her best friend
yes sweaty
who tf disliked this 
may god continue to bless you with flowing words of love truth and strength
today is a great day for the world and america we often forget one of the greatest human experiments that america conducted has change the world we are in now it was america who led the world into the modern multiracial multicultural world order in fact where we live at the present is the new world order to be able to worshiploveexpressfreely no matter what race or gender you are this has not been so for the past thousands of years we often seem to forget that a great time to be alive indeed god bless america
why so many dislikes for what reason
platitudes democrats use race to divide and distract while they do horrific things with our money and our constitutional rights the race thing is tired civil war ended 150 years ago nobody is holding anybody back quite the opposite actually see affirmative action this is just saccharine propoganda
blatant unapologetic racism theres no other reason or excuse for it at this point this girl gave them nothing to use as an excuse the problem is i think most of them dont care if theyre outed as racists at this point
now imagine that this was recited in front of million of audience at the national mall
instead she recited it in front of practically nobody because half the country are prepping for civil war
this young lady brought me to tears will watch again and again
i am going to go out on a limb here to say that the 29k so far that disliked this are either racists or butthurt trump supporters or just very uneducated americans that could not keep up with this young ladys incredible intelligence her articulate use of words and the cadence in which she presented her poem she by far stole the show and will forever be remembered in this moment and i wish her much more great success in her life (edit now up to 65k wow i am so ashamed how petty my fellow americans can be)


i dont know about you but for me she is the highlight of the whole event
@ploppolp you misunderstood my answer or i did not say it right it was all about her composition and words but i did think she was an exceptionally brave young lady also sorry plopplop 
@tina king so nothing to do with the words in her composition interesting
@ploppolp she was speaking to the most powerful men and women in the us
@ploppolp her voice and the way she spoke can you imagine how intimidating that would have been for such a young 22 year old young woman
@john o shea she seemed to be eaten up with jealousy the same type that stormed the capitol and killed people only because their leader told them a bunch of lies and they swallowed the koolaide embarrassing the saddest thing about it is trump wouldnt give two cents for them you just cant talk to irrational people
@mario you are the most negative person in all of these comments i just dont think that somebody tripping and almost falling is funny  but yes in fact i do have a boring life does that make you feel better
@mario i absolutely do i did not mean to give you a thumbs down i was trying to comment and i hit that sorry but i am 65 and my life is boring does that make you feel better
@christina vaccaro your believe is different to me so look with the greatest respect i wish you all best in your life and ill respect your beliefs
@mr meerkat  bidens speech was biden bs  theres nothing to it but pandering and he has zero sincerity
@christina vaccaro  yeah pelosi cant talk without her hands flailing its symptomatic of liberals
born to hand jive baby 
@john o shea talent  ok
@john o shea  as a biden supporter  youre the one thats bought into the endless stream of left wing lies that biden and harris and all the globalist libturds have been spewing for decades
100%
@christina vaccaro ok you believe lies over truth
@john o shea trump was the real dealbiden/harris are senile ass clowns that cant string 2 sentences together  wake up america 
@christina vaccaro why are you jealous of a talented woman
@john o shea ill never vote again 74 million people voted for trumpinvestigate biden/ harris = ass clowns
@s955us84 agreed 
@s955us84 shes a jokebut lets all stand for the girl spouting about slavery with oprahs jewels on her  yay amanda gormanour hero
@mr meerkat all a bunch of phoney ass clowns  good luck america  this guy wont make it the next 4 yearscan u say senility 
@john o shea how could u understand a word with all her 
@mr meerkat yawn
@george washingpun her poem made no sense  but she was born to hand jive baby
nope
@georgia madison  so if a young asian male had written and read the same poem it would not have meant as much to you nothing racist about that not much
@tina king me too such wisdom sage whats your biggest takeaway
very much so it was pleasant to see strong independent women of color give a moving speech to the whole nation im very proud i hope to see this a lot more
ema nava  the poet is the highlight of the inauguration for you now thats just really sad
yes 100% yes 
@mr meerkat cheers bro i know im only looking from a far but iv friends in chicago saying there struggling to find work so i understand you mate
@john o shea if only that were true here in the states its hard not to be a cynic i respect what youre saying brother slainte
@mr meerkat im from ireland im just hoping united states can rest and not turn to violence your vote is a weapon and vote for change
@john o shea hmmm to me it seemed to be pandering to a certain group of people which is in no way inclusive i thought bidens speech about unity was the takeaway here but you do you big guy
im from ireland and i was blown away biden was great with his speech but her words were the ones people should listen to if they want to have a future without hate
what a boring life you must have
@mario glory why is that funny
about the only thing good
i agree
she was and i was so captivated by her wisdom
@sandrina totally
i agree
fantastic a testament to what private school and harvard can blossom and a reminder that everyone should have quality education not just those who can afford it
la super amo
she is our new syrup girl  )
sounds good too bad its so naive and backwards
wow what a beautiful young woman with such a deep wise soul and mind to say such power truths in such a loving and wise way thank you for this poem i wish you the greatest success with these words that you have spoken and for our country
i cry watching this
beautiful complexion well poised and lovely poem

slaves single mother yay  u are awesome 
loved the  air quotes 
@wayne daugh point taken i actually said to someone im not a big lockdown believer but when they started talking about covid wasnt real i just quit responding if everyone listened to science instead of trump we may have nipped this in the bud did biden do everything right 40 years ago hell no long story short trump has become way to unhinged by the endhe had to go the insanity of the election nonsense was disgusting your points are well taken tho im personally glad hes gone the video was intended to be about the poet anyway not really sure how it got so off track
@germangirl dont vote yea does this chick fight for tp
love the ketchup / mustard look and oooo  the jewels from oprah 
@mark haunert lmfao trump closed us off to china right away and guess what they called trump xenophobic and racist for doing it the guy literally could not win hes damned if he does and damned if he didnt oh trump didnt act soon enough oh trumps xenophobic and racist for closing us off to china when supposed covid19 hit the world which one is it did trump not act soon enough or was trump xenophobic and racist for closing us off to china hypocrites
@mark haunert well lets think about it the government and health officials only solution is wash your hands wear a masks and stay 6ft away from others meanwhile small business owners forced to shutt down close there buisness and big corporations remained open wtf does that tell you i know people that lost there entire buisness do to unnecessary forced lockdowns yet big corporations remained open wtf yeah we are mad as hell and any true american should be wake up and youre beloved biden lets refresh your memory on what he stands for maybe you are too young to remember but i remember it all too well people have forgotten that biden was for school segregation back in the 1970s wealthy rich white male didnt want his kids going to school with black kids biden also passed the 1990 crime bill that resulted in mass incarceration of petty crimes that destroyed the black communities the same guy that called well known kkk clan members friends how quickly america has forgotten but hey you aint black unless you voted for biden what a hypocrite
@mark haunert from demokkkrats
@shkspr 78 from her poetry
your childs birthright has changed and not for the better
@mark haunert try again
@mark haunert and just to wrap it uptge lawsuit is in against who and the bill and melinda gates foundation something they would not tell your mainstream media i sent the link earlier no pandemic
@germangirl dont vote  rub brain cells together  im done be safe
@mark haunert this is the outcome of your behavior this is the people that you supporting for virus so deadly that you have to test for it to know that you have it do you even know what you doing do you even know who you are supporting with your statements  so are you telling me you agreeing with women and children being beat down https//youtube/yka1x4j5ikq
@mark haunert first of all the longterm effects on people constantly wearing masks remain to be seen second of all since there is no deadly virus there is no reason to wear a mask in the first place again you wont look at my information if you can rub to brain cells together then thats not my problem go where your mask and make sure you get your vaccineim not curious what makes you think that we are independent where do you get your information from amuse me
@germangirl dont vote also i never said i was a big shutdown fan but people should act like an adult a just wear the mask instead of crying like a child
@germangirl dont vote yeah well not voting make room for a bad situation im not usually political but this creep had to go like i said were not going to change each others minds so whats the point i dont listen to just 1 or 2 information sites either i do think its ironic that im the fool for listening to legitimate doctors trump himself got caught in a tape saying how bad it could be  then came out and tried to blow it off all out of selfishness
this videos of each combined approximately 3 minutes long but i guess your country is not worth itso sad disgusting
@mark haunert this is what a traitor americans it looks like everybody can see what you doing here you are not willing to listen to what somebody else has to say but continuously make comments and want everybody to listen to you im telling you this virus has scientifically been proven not to exist your behavior is absolutely cowardly trying to run your mouth but dont want to hear nothing from anybody else at all cost because of people like you using mainstream media as a source of information believing that we are independent we are in this mess and no i do not vote not even for trump all of corrupt wow shame on you
@germangirl dont vote im not reading all this just so you can tell me theres no covid sweeping the globe yeah its a world wide scam you wont change my mind and i wont change yours i dont need to prove anything but the burden of proof is on you to prove its a sham if trump would have shut his mouth in the beginning maybe it would have been contained enough so there wouldnt be a need for shutdowns the blood is on trump
@mark haunert proove me wrong i dont get my information from mainstream media i do my research prove me wrong2)its a shame how many people like you blindly trusting virologist microbiologist epidemiologist funded by elite parties such as the bill and melinda gates foundation so sad what has america come to because of people like you following orders without questioning true  science small business owners lost their businesses(while walmart remains open  )and  people lost their lives being afraid to go to the hospital men sitting  at home depressed not knowing how to feed their  family at the same time alcohol was made in essential item for them then in their drunken mind to beat their woman and  pedophile their children  yes domestic violence and pedophilia increased drastically during shut down not knowing what those men were doing later  commit suicide so sad whether you know it or not you got a lot of blood on your hands out of ignorance
@germangirl dont vote covid lie really
im sorry but these people are sick i agree with you
@mark haunert instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
youre the one with the irrelevant comment im all over the place complimenting the young lady take you nonsense somewhere else
keep sharing the truth do not let anybody discourage you we are in a battle people will always curse you out thats okay do not let them stop you i think your comment make more sense in here than anybody elses these politicians trying to make look everything so glamorous while the rich get richer(such as bill gates ) and we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper
@mark haunert you bot go away i enjoyed her more than everybody elses
@valentino luketic ok bot go away and let people have a good day 
biden touching girls compilation
obama already did it your children are in debt now congratulations stunning and brave
a soothing balm to mend the broken past the future seems bright when our youth step up and shine a light  a memorable moment a significant turning point bravo amanda gorman
victory does not come with the blade but with the bridges weve made simply amazing words 
the psychotic packet finallly produce because medicine family disagree by a separate room lively plastic estimate
incredible
such insight and wisdom at 22 incredible dont understand how a single person can dislike this let alone 27k people who are disliking it try to get an education and some humanity while you are at it
@sgt koranflusher for a brief moment there i was interested in what you had to say until you became disrespectful to the vice president of these united states im out
@daoakman having served unfortunately does not enlighten one to what is going on in the world the fact that you bring up conservative tells me that you still live in the box i only lean conservative because liberal left me and went insane and marxist which is internationalist true liberalism was embodied by jefferson who espoused that we all remain armed civilians while this is something biden/kameltoe are already trying to undermine importantly both conservatives and liberals today are neither what they claim to be you speak of the income tax code but ignore that fact that income tax itself is anathema to a true constitutional conservative while on the other hand it was karl marx who espoused that income tax should be imposed upon the masses and further that it should be gradient and biased toward the rich in order to control the masses income tax was forced upon all americans by the true masters of this world bloodlines who today control and possess trillions of dollars not just billions who control all world finances not just american who own all major media outlets and virtually write foreign policy and some domestic who elect presidents and who have killed presidents they are our real enemy not each other  and certainly not putin assad or iran
@j p thank you for providing further proof of my point
@sgt koranflusher so sarge dont know if youre still on active duty im a proud us navy veteran looking forward is not bad for the country neither is looking outward yes i know some of you would like to return to days yore but were not going backwards so either you come along for the ride or feel free to hop off anytime dont start with the farce of conservatism you cats support a common thief who wrote a tax code that benefits the wealthy and penalized the working class if youre not a billionaire you support for the worst president ever is against your best interest
@daoakman those are the ones you and she are supporting and speaking for
im disappointed with these comments that call people who didnt care for this poem fools illiterate or that they must be from red states i didnt care for the poem i supported biden/harris though i would have preferred harris as our president instead of biden im not illiterate im well educated i own more than one book of poetry i just didnt care for this poem one of the biggest problems we have in this country is that people automatically think they can villify anyone who disagrees with them even when its as simple as someones preferences on poetry
probably the ones who are guilty of wanting to destroy the country rather than share it
all the dislikes are from red states like kentucky and its because they are illiterate and cant comprehend what was said
@denise so am i miss bimbo
@sgt koranflusher go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
have pity on the fools
its cause theyre too illiterate to understand it
oh thanks for reminding mei havent clicked on dislike yet
well delivered amazing girl she is one of the true american
this is the america i want to be in
@brittany johnson youll be jobless and homeless soon then give me your speech about green new deal

amen this country needs to heal from whats been happening for the past few years and heal foreign relationships
you want this country to heal then people better quit race baiting and dividing civil war ended 150 years ago the only slaves are the ones who made your smartphone that you use to complain about slavery
when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it

im proud to be a black woman in america  today
@steve sand   he has changed 40 yrs in politics and has done nothing but hes changed now   goodbye
@steve sand ok then let white people be proud of being white
@big e because people change and he has spend the last decade working with and helping african americans i agree the crime bill hurt minorities and he was against bussing in the 70s difference is he changed and supports policies that benefit minorities now and trump doesnt he wants t lo raise minimum wage  trump doesnt he has hired tons of minorities it huge positions trump didnt he ended the muslim ban he ended construction on the wall he helped write the violence against women act he ended the ban on trans people in the military he is trying to secure a road to amnesty for immigrants  he is trying to pass an economic stimulus for the pandemic which is hurting minorities the most he did a moratorium on evictions whichs helps many minorities im not saying he is perfect certainly the policies that he currently is in favor of are prominority he trying to end the trump tax cuts that only helped super rich white bollionaires
@big e that was rich
@elysee blackstone of course you dont the irony is people of color voting for a man who despises them
@big e yet you voted for chump i dont have time to tell you the most ridiculous irony of your thought process
@dsd dala this is true
 sorry i forgot you black people can talk about the latinos and the white and the chinese but we cant say nothing about you africanamerican because yall think you are the only ones that have suffered sorry realization of unity for unity realization
@steve sand senator byrd was his mentor and head of kkk chapter biden and hillary did his eulogy not to mention kamala called him out on his racism during primary he also said he didnt want to  junglelize his kids with blacks in school you cant own a 7/11 unless youre indian you can google this its not hidden information im hispanic and would not support him thats why i wonder why other minorities would he also was the sponsor for the 90s crime bill we all know how that turned out
@big e please link your source showing biden being a kkk supporterbecause it is not well known because he has elevated mostly women of color to positions in his cabinet including his vp also even if he was racist america has proven that they will elect a very well known racist to the white house trump you know how you can tell who is more racist the fact that old white men voted for trump the most and people of color voted for biden the most that makes him bad at being a racist if he cant get the racist people to vote for him
i dont understand how this young lady is speaking for biden who is a well known racist and supporter of kkk members can someone explain to me why his bigotry is accepted
@getit goingon elon musk didnt have to fight a 2 front war of not being considered a person because of his skin color and his gender people can be proud of what their ancestors achieved in order to gain equality but being proud that your ancestors were the oppressors and other people had to catch up to you is stupid
@steve sand you are too
me too and im a white guy
@facts over feelings heres a fact for you the constitution was written for rich white men when they said we they sure as f*** did not mean black people native american people women of any race including white poorly educated white men nor any othersnope but you have gotten a pass over the years because every damn thing in media public policy and social rewards saw anyone who was a white male as deserving to the detriment of all others no one wants you to be unproud to be american but today as in every single inauguration there has been a white man or a 1/2 white man at the center of that ceremony and we know its just yet another day as in all the other previous days for white men everywhere to reaffirm they have more privilege you did not need to say it allowed we know we know facts are a great thing rightnot your feelings about privilege
period black woman to me its the strongest and powerful woman in the world
@getit goingon people would not have to make statements like mrs keeshia2yous if they had been respected and given equal opportunities since the founding of this country its fairly obvious you are not actually a world traveler and i speculate you havent been far from home ever because people who do actually travel far and wide understand that not everyone has the same opportunities and privileges they have been given
im sooo happy to hear this
the white privilege has no idea they are always the first to start complaining about what we say i felt the same way amanda made us (black america) proud
@mekeala watkins thank you queen
tow
im not
@getit goingon i care if im black i care if shes black im black before american at least thats what has been forced on us for centuriesso hush and let her have pride
@facts over feelings ok do you have nothing better to do than troll people on the internet  please touch some grass make some friends do something productive lmao
she was wonderful and i dont blame you im a foreigner i watched from thousands of miles away and i was proud to be a woman today god bless x
me also feeling proud to be an american never realized how much i loved my country until 1/6/21 we almost lost it
@getit goingon you shouldnt feel less than out of fear of how someone else might view your confidence you should say it loud im black and im proudwell at least i do anyway
@getit goingon you should be proud of the person you are and if youre white be proud of that it shouldnt be inequality unless you say it with illintent but nothing wrong with freedom of speech and showing how proud you are to be you if you arent proud of who you are than inequality isnt your issue my good sir
@mrs keeshia2you if i go around talking about how proud i am to be white some folks are going to say its racism see the inequality
@ac reginald i hope you find peace have a glorious thursday
@getit goingon im just a black woman proud to be in the skin im in it shouldnt create division im sorry my confidence makes you feel less than or uncomfortable
@fisher king thats the beauty of what this young lady did when she spoke this poem she gave us all something we can cherish and take differently then others but come out with the same hopefulness
@mrs keeshia2you but trump is better than biden and youre not being oppressed either way
@mrs keeshia2you ok ok
@mrs keeshia2you elon musk doesnt go around saying hes a white american that creates devision not unity
@ac yes that is what i said sir
@ac no just confident
keeshia im not black not a woman and not american and still im proud that humanity can produce such wonderful gems as amanda it shows that there is hope for america after the past four years
@mrs keeshia2you oppressors 
@mrs keeshia2you that sounds conceited just saying
@facts over feelings good for you
@ac im obsessed with my cocoa brown skin and my intellectual mind and my resilience to my oppressors my wittiness to see ignorance and not react negatively but to respectfully disagree and let positivity prevail
@getit goingon i am a strong black woman first and i am very proud to be an american i dont understand what any other race has to do with a statement about me but thank you for your unsolicited opinion anyway
@sgt koranflusher when you go low we go high have a lovely day
@getit goingon for real some people are super obsessed with racism and the color of peoples skin they cant let it go
youre an american first of all who cares that youre black white and asians dont have to throw this in every sentence
i know what you mean i wake up every day proud to be a white man in america
she restores my faith in humanity
amen
yes bro

@son dang oh dont get it twisted sweetheart im proud to be black every single day of my life just this day was extra special

i dont understand why i almost cried watching this
ive seen it twice now and got a tear in my eye each time
@betty boop give me examples of common sense from dt pray tell
@rattlesnake81 i would rather hear common sense and plain speaking than the eloquence you get from your 40 year career politicians as they lie to the cameras and line their pockets
tears of relief
almost bawling  each time i watch it touches my soul
biden touching girls compilation
almost i went through a box of tissue
@betty boop youre just orange from envy he was never so eloquent and wellspoken which id probably where your jealousy comes from
@betty boop yeah you jealous
@betty boop yeah like the full of hatred capitol stormers orange ape fans i choose this
because they are using tired emotional tropes to influence your feeling and thinking just like you see them do with advertising its all propoganda

me too and im not even american 
tremendous talent wasted on political pandering manufactured fear hate of our founding and erasing our history democrats have perverted the cause of the greatest civil rights leader ever born mlk jr she was absolutely brilliant where a skinny black girl descended from slaves raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president but then she sucked up to the government elitists great speech i would only ask that she think for herself give us what is truly in your heart and you will turn heads
i mean first you gotta earn respect from the elitists in order to get your platform and then you can go rogue and say what you want if this girl went rogue here shed have been shut down but now she has their respect
thats not poetry (
not you saying that
amazing poetryamazing congratulations
powerful
amazing
what a beautiful poem and recitation dont get the dislikes  too many words for the twitter addicts
magnificent
the emotions and power of that poem was felt all the way here in canada i have listen to this poem several times now and i still get chills
very powerful and a poem for the ages wisdom of someone much olderor tempered by experiences in her background the only operative wording i question is scripture tells us and the gender specific term man

this young lady is a star shining bright
trump maga patriot party

@mlg tactics thats rich coming from some gamergate garbage who only speaks in buzzwords and slurs

https//wwwyoutubecom/watchv=nratemj7zu
wow as someone not american living in another country a spectator to the last 5 divisive chaotic years amandas beautiful and brilliant words even gives me hope for america
her vocabulary was a bit much for my tiny brain
amanda gorman beautiful poetry well spoken
joe biden youre a joke you fooled people into thinking they are woke
my god an accurate poem
lady of the match 
why does it always have to be a black person reciting a poem thats really not a poem but a personally political sermon during the inauguration blacks are not the only race that suffered look i know eggs and rotten tomatoes will be aflyin my way but i must voice my true feeling about this poem recitation thing i worked for black churches for many years and yes a lot of black folks are gifted speakers naturallyany average guy/ lady sitting in the pew can give a rousing sermon any timebut that doesnt mean much when it comes to getting things done or solving problems i found it annoying that they always make it a black thing to represent peoples suffering and struggles when in fact blacks in this country have a lot of help and support and they get entitlements that people of different skin colors dont get

wow ms gorman beautifully captured the struggle of american culture
she was amazing
for those who have and ear to hear the kingdom of the most high is here you can also hear it in her speech for those who know him and the scrip he is in the eartha kingdom divided against itself would not stand mark 313 in the end we all will have to come together and that purpose is his love and his love is how much we can sacrifice ourselves to help each other arise even over personal terrible circumstances today she express the perfect example of us even what the nex generation will have to survive and that love is precious and not weak this is what the children of israel where to achieve in the wilderness the land flowing with milk and honey jerusalem is spiritual place my friends not the place that can see a city that defends each other from evil forces that separates us  the kingdom of heaven is within you and among you luke 1721
this entire farce was so cringe worthy its clear as day no one voted for biden
speechless
just love 
thank you father thank u for loving us so much through ms amanda gorman bless u for your obedience
amen
she gave words to the pleadings of our hearts this young woman is a true poet/prophet/truth sayer
how elegant and eloquent a contrast to the hubris from which we have escaped
hearing and seeing this young lady make wish i am american
wow such beauty great job young lady

oogaa boogaa
she is so inspirational she made everyone look ridiculous
so the comment i posted was meant to be a joke i was being sarcastic of course biden and lady gaga were amazing i didnt mean to offend anyone and if i did im sorry
@jeffrey hinkel while i agree it was a political assertion i still think it was a well written speech with a positive message what is really divisive is how nowadays for one thing to be deemed as good something else has to be put down like the op demonstrated that mentality is what makes social media so toxic
why does her speech have to take away from something else in order to be good
i know her words just hit really hard and it made me feel so much better about this country seeing it from this womans perspective
biden and lady gaga were also inspirational
beautiful
that was a beautiful poem
i believe people are startingjust starting to learn why racism is wrong it causes damage so great that it takes centuries to repair
hon the war against slavery in america ended 150 years ago that battle has been fought and won if you care so much about slavery then why dont you focus your attention on modern day slavery like the children who made your iphone
she served
oh my god this girl was everything yes yes yes her words are the new constitution to have present in our hearts in this present time of 2020 covid (entering 2021)
style 100 substance 0
its 2021 not 2020
well need a new constitution the old one clearly doesnt apply anymore democrats have just urinated all over it
obama and kamala will put ol droolin groopin joe back in the basement within 2 months kamala then takes over and obama pulls the strings i dont think the usa has much of a chancegreensocialist indoctrination in the schools has twisted the minds of young people for the last 30 yearstime to reap the whirlwind
such beautiful words such beautiful american soul
today will be a great day for our great president donald j trump he got us here with a clear understanding of where we need be and go from here truth justice and the american way is coming back for all americans equally and with careful vigilance we will keep up the good fight to make sure that freedom continues for all americans and on a safety note peaceful transfer of power promises made promises kept by president donald j trump thank you for your service sir we will not forget you@@
kids in syria are shaking rn lmao
beautiful

this was everything tomorrow will tell hope for the better with who that seek
tears thats what i felt i am so proud even more to be who i am well done i received the great message
so american brave enough to form a union with purposeharmony for all lincoln and dr king watching over ms amanda gorman and smiling
thanks to all the black children 12 and younger who voted in this election otherwise we would have been stuck with someone who doesnt want another crime bill to lock up super predators
why is cnbc ruining this video with that sign right across the screen we get we know who you are give this young lady the recognition she deserves without distraction
if perhaps she (amanda gorman) is looking for job just come here in africa i will employ you i am looking for a talented mind

@orange moon glows i knowbut i am just saying if perhaps she is looking for workmay be to be an orator
@gilmar morais what kind of work i doubt she needs your work with her book deals etc shes makin money herself
@orange moon glows to work
to do what
biden/harris are traitors
as a black man this was so cringey to watch she swore she did sum lmaoo
as marcus garvey says intelligence rules the world and ignorance carries a burden it is sad to say you are one of those black men with such burden i do not think you are a black man for a moment
f them alll there satan worshipers

she should be hired as one of bidens speech writers she did a great job she will be on every talk show tomorrow and sign her poetry book deal the day after tomorrow such a lovely young lady
for there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it if only we are brave enough to be it
just wow
democratic party is a communist party in usa joe biden is a communist he will destroy usa keep waiting for how he ruins america joe is in same side with ccp ccp gradually infiltrates usa and make red scare come truth keep waiting
omg  god bless you i am a 59 year old white man and you are the most inspiring thing that i have ever seen  unbelievable you brought tears to my eyes of joy and hope
amanda gorman please come here in philippines
beautiful soul sings a beautiful song3
stacey abrams amanda gorman and kamala harris see a pattern here thank you for saving the america i love

i have respectfully translated this beautiful master piece to spanish this is history and must be made available (disclaimer i do not claim declare profess to be a mastertranslator simply saw an opportunity to share something of high value if you have suggestions on changes to the translation you may leave your comment here)  until someone else is willing to translate it officially here it is la colina que subimos cuando llega el dia nos preguntamos donde podemos encontrar luz en esta sombra sin fin la perdida que llevamos en el mar debemos vadearla hemos desafiado el vientre de la bestia hemos aprendido que la tranquilidad no es siempre la paz en las normas y nociones de lo que es justo no siempre es la justicia y aun asi el amanecer es nuestro antes de que nos demos cuenta de alguna manera hemos resistido de alguna manera hemos sido testigos de una nacion que no esta rota sino simplemente inacabada nosotros los sucesores de un pais y una epoca en la que una delgada chica negra descendiente de esclavos y criada por una madre soltera puede sonar con volverse presidente solo para encontrarse recitando ante uno y si estamos lejos de ser pulidos lejos de ser pristinos pero eso no significa que nos esforcemos por formar una union perfecta nos esforzamos por forjar nuestra union con un proposito componer un pais comprometido con todas las culturas colores caracteres y condiciones del hombre asi que no miramos lo que se interpone entre nosotros sino lo que esta delante de nosotros cerramos la brecha porque sabemos que para poner nuestro futuro en primer lugar primero debemos poner nuestras diferencias a un lado bajamos nuestros brazos para poder extenderlos hacia el otro no buscamos el dano a nadie y la armonia para todos dejemos que el mundo aunque sea diga que esto es verdad que incluso en nuestra pena crecimos que incluso cuando nos dolia no perdiamos la fe que incluso cuando nos cansabamos intentabamos que siempre estaremos atados en la victoria no porque nunca mas conozcamos la derrota sino porque nunca mas sembraremos la division la escritura nos dice que imaginemos que cada uno se sentara bajo su propia vina e higuera y nadie le hara temer si queremos estar a la altura de su tiempo la victoria no estara en el filo sino en todos los puentes que hemos construido esa es la promesa de brillar la colina que subiremos si nos atrevemos es porque ser norte americano es mas que un orgullo que heredamos es el pasado en el que hemos entrado y como lo repararemos hemos visto un bosque que destrozaria nuestra nacion en lugar de compartirlo destruiria nuestro pais si eso significara retrasar la democracia y este esfuerzo estuvo a punto de tener exito la democracia puede retrasarse periodicamente pero nunca sera derrotada permanentemente en esta verdad en esta fe en la que confiamos tenemos los ojos puestos en el futuro la historia tiene los ojos puestos en nosotros esta es la era de la justa redencion la temimos en sus inicios no nos sentiamos preparados para ser los herederos de una hora tan aterradora pero dentro de ella nos empoderamos a escribir un nuevo capitulo de ofrecernos esperanza y risas a nosotros mismos asi que una vez nos preguntamos como podriamos prevalecer sobre la catastrofe ahora afirmamos como podria la catastrofe prevalecer sobre nosotros no regresaremos a lo que fue sino que nos trasladaremos a lo que sera un pais magullado integro benevolente pero audaz feroz y libre no nos daremos la vuelta ni seremos interrumpidos por la intimidacion porque sabemos que nuestra inaccion e inercia sera la herencia de la proxima generacion nuestros errores se convierten en sus cargas pero una cosa es segura si unimos la misericordia con la fuerza y la fuerza con el derecho entonces el amor se convierte en nuestro legado y cambia el patrimonio de nuestros hijos asi que dejemos un pais mejor que el que nos dejaron cada aliento de mi pecho bronceado elevara este mundo herido a uno maravilloso nos levantaremos de las colinas doradas del oeste nos levantaremos del noreste donde nuestros antepasados hicieron la revolucion nos levantaremos de las ciudades del borde del lago de los estados del medio oeste nos levantaremos desde el soleado sur reconstruiremos conciliaremos y nos recuperaremos en cada rincon conocido de nuestra nacion en cada rincon llamado nuestro pais nuestro pueblo diverso y hermoso emergera maltrecho y hermoso cuando llegue el dia saldremos de la sombra en llamas y sin miedo el nuevo amanecer florece mientras lo liberamos porque siempre hay luz si tan solo fueramos lo suficientemente valientes para verla si tan solo fueramos lo suficientemente valientes para serlo  amanda gorman
of course a cult follower wont get this  its above their pay grade loved it and so memorable
@joy l why do women always take the ball and go home (metaphorically) when theyre losing an argument lol i hope you take what i said and learn from it dont be the thing you hate and dont be hypocritical the end
@mr meerkat maybe you havent read the negative comments on here that exactly do that rather than respond to each one individually i posted this after my compliment only post president biden also said we should be able to disagree with each other but still move on find a middle ground if youre not a cult follower my comment shouldnt offend/bother you the end
@joy l your main focus/ intention here was to hurl insults/offend those whos political ideology opposes yours the compliment you payed the young lady was an after thought remember what biden said about unity
@joy l i meant you lol
@mr meerkat exactly
why cant people compliment someone without insulting someone
magnificent

@apollo the moon man go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@apollo the moon man yes

yas beauty
token black girl to convince the masses that bidens previous racist comments didnt mean that he is racist
im tired of the blatant disrespect towards young black women shes not a token black girl shes a harvard graduate and a poet laureate what have you achieved during your lifetime let me guess nothing
she overcame her speech impediment just 2 years ago she struggled to say her rs and now she is just mesmerizing so great
dont look at just the performance listen to the content too just wow
if you watch her interviews from a couple years ago you can hear her speech is different shes worked so hard to overcome it such a talent
very interesting as president biden also stuttered
i couldnt tell
the true brilliance of this poem can only be unlocked after twice viewing amazing
amazing
she is the light and the youth and the awesomeness of america she is what makes the nervous ones nervous she is the future 
this was so inspiring who are the stonehearted people who thumbsdowned this
sad trolls mate
irish history goes back 700 years downtrodden by britain manufacturers of neighbour against neighbour man against man brother against brother they still prevail cant own up cant be peace
this brilliant human
shes a beautiful young woman very articulate
dont spoil your talent supporting the wrong people
genius
23k dislikes its hasnt even been a day they need to watch this again
my goodnessshe stole d show such brilliance america happy you breathe out and breathe in
wow what she said beautiful
henceforth a new genre on tiktok 
309 but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated latvia lithuania and estonia yup
24k dislike sounds like 24k of trumps alts or alt bot by trump
simply remarkable trying to praise i find my words inadequate in the light of hers
this young lady had me captivated extraordinary
i wonder how many people caught corona from the microphone  
me *both finger snapping intensly 
wearing natural hair what yes
i am crying
the best unclipped version so many edits already out here  seriouslywhat did the man say about truth
signed  oswald bates
watched and heard you from northern ireland know about division bigots/racists spew lies to create a fear leads to neighbour against neighbour distrust hatred we were woken up in 1968 took another 30 years to get us some semblance of equality your struggle is 400 years and going still fear of dealing with inequality is the problem too many with baggage in their past to own up too fear that they if they came clean would be treated as they treated others afraid of themselves
there isnt an issue with equality that battle has been fought and won for generations there is an issue with race baiting democrat politicians theyve found a gimmick that gets them votes and they will beat that dead horse until its putrid
so well written and delivered i know that no matter how many times i listen to it ill always find a new nugget of beautifully crafted wisdom
black poethow appropriate have to keep the racial crap going the world is watching and laughinganother communist country is born
@madison it has everything to do with race and you know it thats their gimmick thats their shtick gotta keep up the race baiting thing over a war that was won 150 years ago
shes literally a poet laureate from harvard it has nothing to do with race why do people like you always focus on race you just find new ways to make yourself mad sucks to be you i guess
if only some of those many angry and hate filled people would listen to this and just open their hearts to kindness and decency 
you should see some of the replies on the cnn youtube page
word

wow powerful 
deceive the masses with a judadite poem smh so sad
the sadness lies within you  hope you can find the time to listen to this young adults poem(speech) again with an open mind while thinking about someone dear to you and for whom you have loftier expectations and hope for without hopethere is only despair best wishes and written without malice
if you look up charisma in the dictionary guess whose name youll see i thought everyone was doing great today then amanda came on then i remembered what great was shes one in a million
this is a generational speech a speech which will transcend the political divide it is a speech which recognises that the healing process must commence now that all have a part to play in the future of the united states amandas delivery was exceptional her words inspirational and the timing of such a message in a word perfect let both the red and blue stripes combine to bring prosperity hope and health back to a country who has been beaten and bruised for the past 4 years
deamdeam girl  i digyoui feel you
i would love to have her as president also the younger the president the more they will care about our future
stunning
if antifa/blm connects with white house biden will be impeached or fired
what are you on about this thread is about amanda gorman
that was stunning this gives me hope )

why cnbc didnt filmed ally he says through here like other channels
give it 20 years shell be president
yaassssss queen  im so proud to be black 
@encore baby say no to white privilege  
this girl is so powerful and intelligent what a beautiful way to start off the presidency also i see you with those hamilton/ early american government references  much love 
what a beautiful inspiring young woman very impressive 
your people are used for votes  look at the facts democrats brain wash blacks for votes and keep them down
40 acres and a mule

incredible exquisite mighty mighty words and the performance  pray tell what would people dislike about this poem
phenomenal
dropping bars
please dont legalize crack cocaine joe
poetry heals 3
i had shivers hearing this
amanda you have an incredible gift as a poet but above that you have a heart and soul that allows others to question
the hill we climb amanda gorman when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in in all of the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it that would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can periodically be delayed but it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burden but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
@mari fisk rise up
thank you also is anyone hearing hamilton references in the poem besides me
lolandnobody in south africa would believe this dribble
thank you for the lyrics
this young ladyso goodso powerfulso moving thank you
enegildo pena esplendor de la noche dedicado a amanda gorman es el color del esplendor de la noche/ tejida en la luz de las estrellas/ y las palabras/ en sus ojos se vuelve/ al pasado y el presente terrible agonia que nos precede/ en sus caderas de tedio y miedo/ pero su corazon de signos y de musicas/ nos asombra y nos ilumina/ estoy aqui en un pais/ donde solo los poetas nos alimentan/ tendido aqui/ en una realidad nueva y virtualizada/ escucho sus versos en una lengua que no es la mia/ sin embargo la entiendo en el corazon que solo siento/ trasciendo el alma las cosas y poema que lees/ mientras el instinto solo me quia/ (nota en proceso de escritura hecho ahora mismo viendo miercoletras)
gee squidward maybe santa will bring me a dictionary so i can understand what you just said
thats what i call pure poetry applies to any nation in this troubled angry world where lies become truth the truth will always out unfortunately too late for many
regardless of your political views this poem just sucks she is completely talentless this is just some rubbish she is only there because she is a young black woman
@g k but obviously she was trying hard to impress someone lol this poem is about fake experience and selfhood made out of political nuggets no one really relates to this stuff
poetry can be whatever the writer wants it to be and shes surely not trying to impress you 
this is our future and she is heartening
beautiful
beautiful
powerful
she is a remarkable writer so impressed
sooo corny just read the bible everything is there you bet
thank you amanda cometh the hour cometh the woman x
while democracy can be periodically delayed it can not be permanently defeated thank god and amen
@water dubz they are diametrically opposed to each other in principle our republic is based on an already agreed to set of laws which no amount of democracy can change by a vote yet this is something democrat fake liberals today constantly try to chip at and often with the help of republican fake conservatives biden and harris are already doing it if you dont understand the difference you should not be allowed to vote
@sgt koranflusher yep all true just wish the other half of america would wake the hell up and see that too
@george washingpun they dont have to abolish the electoral college now that they have established that americans will sit by and let them commit vast election fraud all the vote counting is done by democrats and democrat run/owned voting machines and their is no plans to change any of that there will and can never be a true election in the usa again without civil war and all this is covered up by a complicit media system owned by 5 corporations in agreement with each other
in other words its only democracy if the outcome fits her agenda disgusting message bad poem
@sgt koranflusher nobody knows that they want to abolish the electoral college and make it a 50/50 vote and that is when the us will officially descend into anarchy
@sgt koranflusher they share very similar ideologies dont know how that holds any relevance though
@snore lax humanity**
yes one of my favorite part but i love it all
did you know that america is a constitutional republic not a democracy do you know the difference i doubt it
lets hope so democracy is pure evil



incredible
the crazy thing is that she mustve written this in two weeks
@j m trump supporter no hes a clown why do you automatically assume that anyone who disagrees with you is a trump supporter i didnt find her poem to be that good and im simply pointing out that shes only getting praised because of her race and political affiliation
@lupe guadaloupe not really im white so you will understand just how privileged i am i just dont do make believe ever its not cynicism or pessimism its realism and pragmatism you should try it
if she did what a brain she has people here in comments that are jealous of her they cant see good in peoples words it dont surprise me but i thought there might be some people say look its time for peace clearly people dont want people because of the misinformation trump has fed people
@derek spitz is cynicism your default attitude what a hard life that must be
@j m its really not that good and two weeks to compose isnt especially impressive either dont get me wrong its not a terrible effort just not worth the hysterical and hyperbolic reactions that it seems to be getting from some people if the poem was written by a young white woman you can be very sure it would not be getting the same response which can only lead one to conclude that those who are gushing about it are doing so for political reasons
@facts over feelings if youre a trump supporter calling us brainwashed that is the most hypocritical thing i have ever heard
@derek spitz because writing a poem that good in 2 weeks is very inspiring and surprising
@facts over feelings in years to come your words will be forgotten while her words will live on for generationsin years to come yours and mine childrenschildrens children will learn those words in school and know her name
@water dubz what did i say that was demeaning towards her nothing at all
@facts over feelings please tell im curious what makes you think that demeaning a young woman over her poem because of a difference in opinion is right what ever happen to constructive criticism but please go against he flow and say this isnt worthy of praise because she didnt write something as worthy from aristotle doubt you couldve made anything better
@facts over feelings go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@fisher king youre brainwashed
@dimonte baker or maybe you just want to feel good about yourself by going along with what everyone tells you you should think it was an ok poem but certainly not worthy of the praise thats being spewed out
@facts over feelings you dont recognise greatness right in front of you
it really doesnt take much to impress you people does it
in competitions usually we are just given a subject and maybe an hr or hours to write so 2wks are still fine she mightve revised it a couple of times she did great

why is that crazy
she didshe said on a pbs interview that she started the poem early jan before the insurrection occurredthat this was the direction she felt led to go then 6 jan occurred and confirmed her poems natural trajectory she inspires and is wise beyond her 22 years should god bless me to see 2036 she has my vote
so powerful beautiful and inspirational i love this and the confidence and erudite eloquence in which she presented it from canada wishing biden and his administration well in undoing and healing the damage done the last 4 years congrats and cheers
bravo
i hope ill be forgiven for saying her hairdo is awesome

those hamilton references just made a perfect poem 10x better
what a fraud sad day for america
wow wow wow
not since ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country has there been more eloquent words spoken on a us inauguration this lady has a bright future well done indeed
forge a union with purpose unity
we just witnessed the biggest crime of our life time satan party/ pedo party wheres tom hanks
god shes beautiful
such poise and a fantastic poet our youth in our country humble me
camanda and chief 2036 looking forward to you 
big up amanda
flawless
that hamilton reference 
trump left a word to biden joe you know i won its true shame on you biden
words do not fail her but they fail me in trying to express how incredible this young lady is
@catiniya her message is a lie in response to lies
@jace bb my job is to bash the clown heads back down into their holes
@sgt koranflusher if your so renowned stop responding to literally every comment lmfao not only does no one care but ur wasting your time/
@sgt koranflusher whoever you are youre 100% correct
@sgt koranflusher idc if its good or bad her messages were still outstanding and important
@sgt koranflusher shush troll
@richard lipov i am actually published you dumdum and i live with a published poet and also well travelled and well read on history hence my handle
@sgt koranflusher i look forward to more bad poetry from her the messages she was making were melodic and inspirational as well as her in person recitation your handle as koranflusher identifies you as an angry person i doubt you have credentials as a literary critic
you know little about poetry she is actually pretty bad at it
lets go you young black princess patriot of a truly great nation 
wait i thought she was a queen im confused princess or queen
@encore baby still is
with great respect i applaud
wow im truly in tears

ive never been more proud to be an american than i did hearing this im crying so hard right now
you are incredible young lady im so glad that they chose you i look forward to whats next for you again incredible thanks for sharing your gift with us may god continue to bless your beautiful self
why blacks look so good in colorful clothes
 i couldnt wait to hear her share the hill we climb but while listening i found out i still wasnt ready for that powerful truth ahmazing thank you 
so good  made me cry tears of hope
awesome maya reincarnated
she did an amazing job soo inspirational
10% dislikes who the f are these people did they just click on this link for the sole purpose to dislike are there cnbc viewers who just dont like black women or are there just so many jealous poets out there hating
im not even american and i teared up at this how on earth does this masterpiece have over 2k dislikes
@josephine bournes not all trump supporters are salty dont assume
@beautifulchaos13 hello again russia
womenz beauty channel the fake new media biden pelosi harris all dems unfortunately have divide the country w their false narratives inciting violence all summer blm etc
because its racist woke claptrap rubbish
to the haters of all trump supporters i didnt vote biden i do think this young american shines like a star and is a bright example of a true american she is talented articulate poised and beautiful i dont think she would want us spewing hate in defense of her beautiful heart love what she has to say on a beautiful inauguration day ghandi said be the change you want to see 
jealousy thats all
those are just trolls theyve gone to almost all inauguration footage to dislike the content thats okay love decency democracy goodwe won
2k people trying to stand up for their overlord and savior trump
@joel lambert not unable but unwilling
dont look at the dislikes look how many people liked and watched it all those likes are people whom were amazed and inspired by her speech truely wonderfull
as she said the norms of just is is not justice let that sink in now to be brave enough to be the light
dislikes dont matter honeythink of 20k goosebumps
it was cringe
@kilal googlestaffers sold
you really dont know how this speech can have now 33k dislikes shes an intelligent conscientious black female reciting a socially relevant poem at the inauguration of a democratic president
same
if weve learned anything disagreement is constant and ok how we treat each other everyday matters we still have to solve problems together instead of fingerpointing at others push your voice in your local communities (where change really happens)
because the country is divided they dont see her as an american they see her as biden support or democrat we need to stop that trump supporters (over 72 millions) or biden supporters narrative youre all americans regardless your differences
@josephine bournes those are the white supremacists
you are human  that matters )
trump supporters their poet would be a proud boy or rudy
you can tell they are trump supporters the enemy of progress
dont worry those are the trumps mob they are losers
all republicans
theyre evil mean and nasty people just like their dear departed leader
all trump supporters across the globe including nigeria christians
from the american racist
@josephine bournes and bots which are rampant on youtube
they are called proud boys aka kkk
cowards unable to think outside the box they live in
@drrestezi true i wouldnt doubt a good portion of those dislikes were racerelated absolutely disgraceful
@michelle baldwin facts even one dislike on this vid is an injustice
yeah thats the most plausible theory trump supporters just cant take the l gracefully sad
sadly there will alway be haters they are miserable people who will never be happy no matter what
2700 racists cant appreciate poetry and wisdom from a young woman of colour
or any
those 2k dislikes represent salty trump supporters 
period
beautiful
her words made history today awesome job
what an amazing voice youngest poet laureate delivered some very important lines
this young lady in unbelievably amazing her words stirred my soul
martin luther king jr had a dream it lives  as a poem delivered at the right time in history by a young lady full of strength and precision with the radiance of a beautiful light love and hope is always there when you/ we need it god bless  thank you 
when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimned hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
this is sure perfect
will you post a link to where others can find it
thank you for taking the time to print this out
amazing
what was done to us in 2020 is long gone by trump and this virus shell never reupear the lord shall see the way for us now even though we have a new president don t he s going to improve for this nation is our god and only
i dont like biden but i like her
yes but note that bidens wife invited her to the inauguration to me that shows the bidens appreciation of great talent and openness to youth no more spite or envy in the white house
the way she uses her hands to accent her words just amazing
beautiful best part of the whole show
it wasnt really poetic but okay
a poem to a white nationalist and racist i dont want my children to be raised in racial jungle
beautifully delivered this is your future treasure
i have no doubt that this poem will be taught in our classrooms to future generations of americans
so perfect for this time in our country the arts are a way to heal communicate know each other art is not a thing  it is a way
you want to heal by banging on and on about slavery that ended 150 years ago while ignoring actual slavery today beijing biden has lined his pockets off the profits of slave labor in china but nobody talks about that
how could anyone downvote this
what powerful words amanda youre truly an inspiration and america is *so proud* of you
at 22 she has superseded many adults very talented and filled with selfesteemed hope young adults saw her speech
wow such a beautiful poem i am at a loss of words
i had chills the whole time
why trump you did this to our lost world but now we are comeing back we are not going back wards now we must go forward thats whats up now ha ha
roses are red  violets are blue now the swamp is back in power to give power to the few we are told trump was a liar but bidens words are true there will be no more investigations or accusations and the globalist will tell the us what to do
masterful
what great insight manifested in a profound poem well done
beautiful well written and well said
she was at her best today
change our childrens birthright yeah the ones who make it out of the womb dont forget to get vaccinated
all right now lordy to our god yes lord most definitely aman
she was amazing half eminem and half dr seuss
lmaoo
makes my heart soar 3
if she ran for president in the future i would totally vote for her but im canadian lol
thats a lot of words hope something comes from them
you are a strong talented and courageous young woman god bless you and god bless america
yeah but can you pass a calculus exam
beautiful
this poem is the beginning of telling the truth in this country
@encore baby people who believe in conspiracy theories dont ever remember facts you know exactly what i mean i dont think your brain is completely gone i hope not
@encore baby the earth is round and water is h2o there is a truth my friend
yes truths like biden and harris put more blacks in jail than anybody
pretentious smug bullsh*t 100% cringe
omg that was beautiful
what does this even mean i just want a functioning public system
it means huckster race baiting and sappy platitudes to keep the sjws and lifetime movie crowd distracted while they rob us
hamilton quotes  love love love
amazing so young so inspiring
beautiful
eloquently and powerfully saidshe reminds me of the young lauryn hill
im not sure what i am anymore but definitely dont identify as an american  f this country
i just want to hug her and say thank you my god that was amazing
she did an amazing job
talk about poetry in motion she was mesmerizing simply brilliant
that was simply beautiful
she was so good all her lines had a meaning where can we find light in this never ending shadewhat a way to start loved it
aesop rock has more meaningful bars
if only were brave enough to be it
gold rings old gold new gold be happy perfectly inline with moses and his golden calf pulverised the naphtha sniffing elias blown to the sky in a hellfire gold double burps from black holes lady gaga a black hole singing
phenomenal
why does she have to mention that shes a descendant of a slave
im white and my dna test just told me that ive got ancestry from west africa so im the descendant of a slave too bfd it ended 150 years ago lets talk about things that actually matter like why is the government destroying the economy and peoples constitutional rights over a cold
she was incrediblebest poem i have ever heardgreat job momyou must be so proudloved her little gestureswowshe blew me awaywell done
wow amazing
this young lady said everything that this nation should feel and not look back at what was but look to where we are going and look to what our nation can be
young butterfly  way past her caterpillar stage
such a powerful momentous voice ringing in light and strength honored and in awe to share in it
amazing this is the america i know and love
lol this is really bad
you are a genius young woman i would say a young maya angelou youre using your brain and beauty for the good of the country you told the truth i loved it we all did i watched it on tv live and then again and again thank you for this historic moment a young black woman saluting the first black woman vp
magnificent and profoundly touching
wow
very nice just beutiful poet
wow
somewhere there are hordes of republicans wondering why most of this poem didnt rhyme
and a few democrats realizing its merely political prose 
amazing speech 
amanda bless you please give dylan a ring and collaborate two class artists of different generations would be interesting
this is the best thing that has come out of the usa in a long time this one will be for the history books
biden looking like he tryna eat that girl
strikingly beautiful prose i was awestruck by every stanza the words were healing after what our country has been through but the red and yellow is distracting
shes breathtaking something about her presence is captivating
@dust bag shes a actual white liberal malcom x warned us about people like her just a sidekick for the slave master smh

@wnrc ltv opposite day is tuesday fyi
@germangirl dont vote you should see a doctor if you ever believe in science again
@facts over feelings the one whos being a fool is you thank you
@maryam tanveer youre a fool
@facts over feelings you dont even understand what she said she didnt say its breahtaking because shes black but because of her speech  u need to understand before saying something stupid
so many people in this thread getting bothered by a simple compliment about this awesome student so bitter americans do better
@candy pop no you moron im saying that its racist to expect less from her or set the bar lower for her because shes black thats exactly what happened with her deal with it
@facts over feelings bruh nobody said anything about race they were complimenting the girl as a person so now youre saying its racist for us to compliment people of colour what an idiot
@candy pop i absolutely exposed the way i think of her she wrote a mediocre poem that doesnt warrant the attention she received and people are going over the top with praise for her solely because of her race thats racist and you should work on yourself
@facts over feelings seems like youre the only one who thinks like that bud you just exposed the way you think of her
tagalog version https//youtube/xz3xrbkj5q8

@we got this wow apparently it doesnt take much to impress you
@tina marie if african ancestry is so beautiful then why do so many black women wear weaves and wigs  yeah shut up and tell all the black women who do that to stop appropriating white culture lol
@salty gorilla so true we shpuld replace her cwacka ass like we replaced jake from state farm n everyone else
@this chicken bussin no you are actually 
@suzanne mcneal  keep drinking the koolaid
@facts over feelings  and oprah has already taken her under her flabby wing
@juan garcia  up yours juan
@s955us84 your mother
shes as phony as oprah
by the way its spelled *of course also learn how to use ellipsis your control over the english language is atrocious regardless of what color you are
@wnrc ltvi was judging her based on her marvelous talent with poetry no mention of color was ever made but it bothers people like you when someone black is talented so you had to stick your big mouth in the conversation and act like it has anything to do with her skin color shes talented for a person of any color you dont know what my expectations are of black peoples it just makes you uncomfortable to see a talented black person so you want to project your racism onto others
she make satanic ritual
@lh sd it is really isnt about me who am i i am not really in the equation at all i just think she is very talented and what a great speech plain and simple
is it the ooga booga african stuff on her head she looks like a ugandan not american
@dorset deb peace surely you jest or maybe you were living in a cave these past years no peace
@dorset deb troll move along anything you say is irrelevant
@juan garcia of coarsethrow racism into the argument i was only pointing out your bigotry of low expectations you have of black people now that is what racism looks like you need to judge and treat people based on the content of their character instead of what they look like otherwise its fake and racist
@wnrc ltv no its just that people like you cant stand a black person being more intelligent than you so you try to diminish them by suggesting theyre nothing special and are only being treated as such because theyre black its merely an unfortunate defense mechanism you use to compensate for your insecurities
@facts over feelings no one brought race into this except you youre a bigot who cant stand to see a young black girl accomplish more than you ever will her being breathtaking is commentary that is based solely on her oratory talent and nothing else
@facts over feelings i agree with you these people get star struck when someone like barack obama completes a full sentence its almost as if they have no experience with black people other then the crap they watch on tv and youtube
yeah shes a great speaker spewing mainstream media propaganda cliches democrat political propaganda repeated ad nauseam the last four years this is not original
@stef f if you appreciate amanda you would have to specify for what if it is her poetry that would only show you know nothing about poetry as fewer and fewer people do if you appreciate her for anything else from this video then it would have to be her unobservant but twisted and degenerate view of the world and that would make one a degenerate fool like her
facts over feelings so just what adjectives do you believe would be acceptable to describe ones appreciation for amanda gorman
captivating to a fool
@salty gorilla bruh
captivating enchanting bewitching wait thats evil
@facts over feelings just say you dont understand the poem its okay 
@ facts over feelings the poem is actually good and she is very good at public speaking as well

stop it poor child heres one more kiss  for you youll be okay
thats the african ancestors glowing on herbeautiful
breathtaking (   )

@germangirl dont vote im a hospice nurse not icu were batting clean up in this horror show im the on call on from 5pm to 8am weekdays so our casemanagers get some rest from 5pm on fridays to 8am monday i cover them all im the one you call at 3am when your mother takes a turn for the worse i bought a car at the end of november ive put 5000 miles on it doing my job dont tell me im not busy please take another sip of your koolaid and have a nice day
@facts over feelings these people keep telling the truth theyve been completely indoctrinated by mainstream media
@suzanne mcneal retired icu nurse here my former coworkers report no such thing  including the ones in europe tired of people like you putting out a fake sob story just so everybody else can applaud you to make you feel good about yourself and if you are really a hospice nurse i am concerned for the safety of your patients how do you even have time to post things on youtube we are in a middle of a so called  pandemic according to you people are dying left and right you should be getting your sleep if you are off work and probably you couldnt even get a full 8 hours so how do you have time to post on youtube in the middle of a pandemic answer me this in addition please explain to me what patients are dying from if the virus has scientifically been proven not to be isolated (exist) therefore what kind of treatments do those patients get with that i ask myself are they dying of a socalled virusor iotregenic causes( aka death by medicine) you are aware 250000 people die from iotregenic causes every year right your turn
@sea thank you 
@facts over feelings not on any meds as a nurse though im kind of worried that your arent taking yours as prescribed
@germangirl dont vote hospice nurse here so sick of seeing people deny this disease having loved ones dying on hospice directly because if this disease and still denying it its real its horrible and it searches out any physical weakness whats yours
@mark haunert fr people are mistaking true sincere compliments with toxic positivity and apparently racism all were doing is stating facts that shes gorgeous has a very calming voice and as u said she was handpicked some people really make me question our existence 
@mackenzie miller exactly and thank you im white and have made comments about her being so damn pretty ive been scolded by at least 3 people for all kind of silly reasons i dont know much about poetry but i understand that she won national awards and is a harvard graduate not to mention mrs biden hand picked her but her smoky sweet voice and stunning looks kept me watching 
@facts over feelings whatd you take from the poem what do you think it was about
@mark haunert what distortion lowering the standards for someone because of their race is in fact racism stop virtue signaling and learn to be truthful even if it isnt popular
@albin m and your point
@rebecca harrison i agree with you on that comment sounds like a salty girl thats jealous of a drop dead beautiful woman hell i showed my wife to see how damn cute she is then the comment distorts it to you being the racist crazy people 
@dorset deb go cry somewhere else deb were enjoying ourselves over here 
@facts over feelings you take yourself more seriously than anyone else here ill tell you that
@beaudy101 youre embarrassing yourself just stop
@derek spitz well i have to admit this girl reminded me of an episode in the hunger games dressed all nice giving a speech with a microphone while we standing there hungry with holes in our clothes it was breathtaking creepy
@last2dollars youve exposed yourself as the racebaiter you are and you should learn what racism is before you throw the word around youre dismissed
@suzanne mcneal take your meds
@abigail white breathtaking oh do get a grip abigail
@rebecca harrison sorry but the truth is the truth personally i find this whole parade disgustingdisgusting display of a paradeinstead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
@mussi93 yeah i know i like to dangle carrots to see how clever they think they are obviously this one is just starting out
@facts over feelings i agree im an english college lecturer and i teach a creative writing poetry module i say this poem is ok but really nothing special if the poem was read by a young white woman or a white man the reaction would have been very different so on that basis i have to conclude that the hysteria surrounding this reading is unauthentic and politically motivated sad really
@facts over feelings lol for a troll you put some real effort in on that  didnt you did you put the same effort in your handlefacts over feelings yeah yeah  got it instead just spew feelings over facts thatll spin em yawn not original not clever move along now
disgusting display of a paradeinstead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
and there it is a real racist will reveal themselves every time  have a seat sir youre a white man in amerikkka youll be okay 
@facts over feelings shes breathtaking because she wrote a poem like that the poem leaves you speechless in its dignified inarguable statement of truth her presentation unique engrossing and lovely her words humbling in their truth yet she humble in her recitation shes breathtaking because shes glorious and her light shines thru her waters run very deep positively glorious
it hurts huh   this will make you feel better heres one more 
@beaudy101 just ignore the obvious troll
@facts over feelings thank you you will find almost the exact same fragmented overly smooth and self absorbed voice along with the random hand signs at any modern poetry event shes good but it was the political point of view that modern poets have that caused the event to have a poem laureate
@beaudy101 because she is speaking of this person reciting her mediocre poem as if shes created something timeless and amazing it was a simple poem that any 7th grade student should be able to write shes only getting this attention because of the color of her skin and everyone knows it we should move beyond race hustling and start judging people based on merit
@facts over feelings why do you assume anyone is expecting less how and why do you come to that assumption with the words that were used by abigail
@lgbtq all lives matter lets fight against bullies uh ok
@rebecca harrison yes it sure does it says that i dont expect less from someone based on the color of their skin youre a racist which is why my comment bothered you
@facts over feelings your comment says an awful lot about the kind of person you are than anyone else here )
@this chicken bussin i hear south korea elections are safer than americas
breathtaking why because shes black and can read a poem because she can use complete sentences seriously do you really set the bar that low


@salty gorilla to
i am obsessed with her speech
@this chicken bussin 
@salty gorilla 
@salty gorilla youre embarrassing
your last name is white thats racist
youll be remembered young lady clear classy  well delivered

that was outstanding but 2000 thumbs down jesus please deliver the ones still struggling to see truth
just wow wonderful words 
victory in cheating huh pretty sad how corrupted victory has become
so eloquent so poised
let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that will forever be tied together victorious grieved hurt and tired you live in the richest country in the world you entitled racebaiting orwellian fool
grief and hurt and tiredness those are human experiences has nothing to do with the country you live injust part of understanding the realities of life part of being a person whats foolish about that
if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birth right
not sure this was the intention but this reminded me of lincolns words that let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it
@snore lax loserrrr
@snore lax oh yeah cause its conservatives that fought for human rights 
not with democrat run schools you wont i have to sit back and watch this madness again
the children of this country is in charge of our future raise them well and keep them educated so the next genration and so on could grow as people shed love a new year for america  and a better year for all
awesome
watched this live in singapore along with millions around the world absolutely the most riveting five minutes i have had the privilege to witness if i closed my eyes i swore i heard mlk speaking through her at times
wow

very encouraging to read these positive comments i love these words and the delivery beautiful

@maxine lamont 
@maxine lamont of you have to ask
@salty gorilla ok then since i didnt understand your comment please do tell what you really think about the poem and the poet
@clawedorb55 dont be so triggered little girl 
@giulia c you sure do like to project your own assumptions onto my comment i guess you missed the question mark  im questioning on what basis other than her speaking ability is she receiving such a large amount of praise
@salty gorilla you said that the only good thing about her is how she talks and you compared her to hitler
@giulia c when did i say that she is bad 
@salty gorilla no shes also being praised for the message that shes conveying she doesnt encourage war vilence discrimination shes an amazing poet martin luther king was a great speaker gandhi was a great speaker its not like someone is necessarily bad just because they speak well
@giulia c theyre both being praised simply for being good speakers thats the similarity pay attention
@clawedorb55 i said nobody asked didnt say anything about caring also it must take forever for you type when you capitalize the first letter in every word 
@maxine lamont youre missing the point
@re o on the one hand youre right hes craving the attention on the other hand im having fun 
@maxine lamont by the way you havent put a single fact on the table get an education will you how the heck could your grandmother pass away from a virus that has been scientifically proven to exist what kind of doctors are you going to wow i would love to sit down and have a talk with this docunbelievable 
@maxine lamont after im done with you you will be the embarrassed one im calling you out i hear you talkin you not saying anything mainstream media will also push your vaccine down our throat 24/7 same they got  caught staging scenes below so people will blindly follow what others do https//youtube/dexb1zgjl84 no demand on vaccine no production simple the only pandemic i see is on television you our mainstream media became the enemy to the people of this land and at some point it will be held accountable i hope everybody is aware these media lies are an act of treason that  caused a lot of lives and why are you guys not talking about that mrdrosten the world health organization and the bill and melinda gates foundation have been sued  for crimes  against humanity as of 2 weeks ago https//rumblecom/vbjefumoneytalkslawsuitingermanyenghtml https//youtube/jjfctomfsxw
@fisher king im interracial  wow
@re o im sorry but i could have done that crap with my eyes closed but thats just me plus i speak up for my americans and all people on this earth not for corrupt politicians who enrich themselves while make others suffer
@apollo the moon man ur mad shes making history
@salty gorilla how can you compere a 22 yearold poet who is trying to spread the wolrd of democracy with hitler in wich universe is that even remotely possible
@fisher king dont feed him hes just insecure that hes in 40 and still living in his moms basement meanwhile a 22year old woman is having a day of her life
@germangirl dont vote ok if thats what you think i think shes an amazing and beautiful accomplished woman it takes guts to express political sentiment in front of million people
@re o hush baby i am 52 and nowhere as accomplished you have 30 more years to either be me or her
so should a 22 year old be talking about life like that lol she barely lived
i know she is an idiot most of her so called poem was she plagiarized research it
@re o lol
@germangirl dont vote oh dear all this happened and thats your excuse for being racist then youd better get back to your fox news so you can consume some more nonsense
@princess of keys im sorry but whoever that was on state is not the best of society in my opinion i believe she has been heavily groomed the average honest hardworking labor person working at mcdonalds trying to make it deserve my full respect
@clawedorb55 waiting
@dannilicious because i can gotta problem 
@clawedorb55 no insult put facts on the table you going to have to put on your big boy panties
@fisher king if this whole parade including the outfit etc does not show you that this girl has been groomed and indoctrinated from a young age then i dont know what it takes to convince you besides this is not about black and white this is about rich and pooropen your eyes america all these politicians and governors are up there eating filet mignon and caviar sitting in mansions (still getting payed like average 150000 to 200000 aprox)while the average business owner is not allowed to keep his shop open to put food on his familys table we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper and they up there in glamorous clothing having speeches music and poems i dont know if you vote but the reason i stopped is because we are voting for one bird of prey with two wings they go behind the curtains at split the money cooperations such as the bill and melinda gates foundation have been using mainstream media and politicians to enrich themselves even more dont you see that why is mainstream media not talking about the world health organization bill and melinda gates foundation is right now being sued for crimes against humanity for all of this why dont they shove that down our throat 24/7 but no they talk about vaccine all day long our nation have been indoctrinated by mainstream media since world war 1 time for people like you to wake up because this is not going to get better if you dont do your own research
@germangirl dont vote yeah growing up in the usa as a black girl really spoils you
@fisher king yep
@betty boop yeah lets all hold hands and sing kumbaya while young men still are being slaughtered
@maxine lamont impressive  @  this girl has been groomed(spoiled) from childhooddisgusting display of a paradeinstead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
@sasuke bestie  @  this girl has been groomed(spoiled) from childhood on you maybe didnt have that advantage so dont feel bad
@re o this girl has been groomed(spoiled) from childhood on you maybe didnt have that advantage so dont feel bad
@tattoo soda i dont know but this girl has definitely been groomed from childhood on you maybe didnt have that advantage
@tattoo soda dont worry everyone lives their loves differently no need to feel like you have to be the best of the best in society at all
@sonic the hedgehog if you dont care then why tf are you replying smh
fun fact nobody cares
@fisher king this constant hammering on race and a slavery that was ended at the cost of thousand of american young mens lives 150 years ago is incredibly divisive
@stanzavik bc u asked a question dahhh
@dannilicious why are you replying
i thought she was 12 she cant be 22
fun fact she is a horrible speaker
@salty gorilla right
@stanzavik why are you commenting
why is that fun
biden touching girls compilation
@salty gorilla hitler speeched about hate and division not hope and inspiration
@salty gorilla jfc hitler really dude just go away your negativity isnt welcome here
fun fact she is actually 23 *
looking every bit of 12
@salty gorilla name checks out salty af 
@maxine lamont shes a very enthusiastic speaker yes other than that   all this praise of her over a speech is reminiscent of hitler being praised simply for delivering powerful speeches 
@cumbiambero i dont recall mentioning trump
@salty gorilla fun fact trump lost loser
@re o am 19 and same
yes same age as the woman who stole pelosis laptop
i am also 22 but i am nowhere as accomplished as she is 
its a fun fact but you got me thinking im 31  what have i done with my life 
fun fact nobody asked
even more fun for facts is that she is also the first youngest poet laureate
we seek harm to none good line let see how long will take for boden to drone and bomb some midle east or african nation
that was awesome
if we could just have more young people like that young lady i had to hear it one more time very special
i cant help thinking how beautifully her hands move with her words  compared to the ugliness of the outgoing presidents hands and words
prophetic words she sure made history today
what a beautiful young womanand i dont mean just her appearance
if we emerge mercy with the might ( lord jesus) and the might with right then love become our legacy its a very powerful line folks 
amen
brava
with young people like this you know america will have a bright future
wow i dont know her but i am so proud of her
this is the epitome of excellence i thank god for the gift that hes given her amen
this i enjoyed most of all today
for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it more powerful and true than many of those political speeches and applies and appeals to all the nations of the world and their people
wow this is the next maya angelou
inspiring america  united we stand nothing is impossible california proud of her 
us kids have witnessed so much history this year wait till our kids ask about 2020 tvt
astonishing young woman your poem moved me
astonishing
its all the way live
this young lady amanda gordonis not only an amazing poet/orator she is a havard graduate at the age of 22 years old *this young lady commanded this stage wow
that young girl an adolescent activist her moralizing poem such a cliche such a copy so obviously influenced
shes a part of this historic moment a moment for women a moment for people of color for america as a whole she is now a part of our history and a part of the history president biden and vice president kamala harris are paving
@jujulian trumper logic ignore or discredit entire arguments saying that biden won and cherry pick the ones that make you look morally superior
@jujulian my man i have yet to find a single valid argument on why the whole election is a joke if you find one please tell me
@avett riiiight cause every single court denying every single case isnt fishy at all or how supreme court denied the texas case isnt fishy either
@matt lee democrat logic ignore or discredit entire arguments and cherry pick the ones that make you look morally superior
@jujulian trump supporters only argument wake up sheep
@avett thank you
dang the amount of trolls and jerks in this reply section is unbelievable the election was never stolen #getoverit
@meagan wilson im not in denial i know perfectly well that this election was stolen you on the other hand are a sheep that sees only that fits your twisted narrative i pity you you are a willing particpant to tyranny and you dont even know it so sad
@freeclimb aww sweetie you lost its time to move past the first stage of grief denial isnt healthy for you 
@avett you wouldnt have a clue as to what trumpie feels because youre a closed minded fascist that belives in censorship and destroying those that think differently from you so you project how you reacted the last 4 years to trump on to others because its all you know you should work on that
great shes apart of the first historically stolen election in us history yeah great thing to be part of smh
@avett well then is ok the poem is misery as this moment of the history is you will see soon
look like this is the moment when you are not clever enough
@keletso rosenberg youre entitled to your opinion however im entitled to have an opinion on your opinion and so forth
@keletso rosenberg ok then what makes you such a great judge of poems
@hyuuga kro you ignore the historical significance of people of color speaking yes it wouldnt be as historical because white people dont have a history of being oppressed and silenced if anyone is diminishing history here its you
i bet if same poem was given by a white female it would have not been much of a big deal to all these people do not diminish history of any country with such poems they are amusing and creative at best
@kaila hodgemcnutt tbh i think hes right good poem but not history like illmatic ) but yeah se the youngest so technically its history until some other person that is younger does it
@keletso rosenberg jealous i see
someone will do a report for high school history class in 30 years and they will read this speech this will live on this is history in the making
@keletso rosenberg lets see your poems
@snore lax yeah you just snore on
@jujulian people were laughing for four years now they stand still and realise that not all americans are idiots
@jujulian hahaha so true
yeah the very first blatant theft of the election praise democracy praise the democrats
shes of this historic moment not just a part of it if one is simply a part of something there are lines of separation whereas being of the moment indicates unity
@jujulian only sick and deranged minds are laughing at this moment
was to me this poem reminds me of everything that happened to get here and what happened today )
@jujulian awww look another trumpie whos feelings were hurt its okay just sit down and be quiet this is absolutely making good history
this isnt historic at all and people are laughing at this whole thing wake tf up
stunning light brave enough to see it brave enough to be it wow just wow amanda gorman you are inspirational thank you for being who you are
nice haiku
yay now lets give her a 150k a year job in the federal goverment yayayay
beautifully done
i dont get the need for these poets they are so boring
she is  im speechless  i could listen to her for hours  beautiful young woman  her words flow like satin 
i think my patriotism grew ten times after listening to this speech
amanda gormans poem is sublime
 congrats for your appointment as our 1st poet and thank you for your heartfelt poem we are proud to be graced with your words today and look forward to many more i truly hope those words began to move hardened misled hearts as well

trust the top comment to be a fkn putdown disguised as a compliment
@secret oktober78 don t fall for trumps lies its been part of his narative all along that people should believe him and not science or journalists except if they follow his game
@mr meerkat people also take my figurative speaking literally
@julius seizure you said she was 14 years old
@julius seizure she is 22 yrs old went to college and writes at a 6th grade level
@julius seizure but shes poc so we have to act like its astounding and amazing or else youre a nazi
not hard in a crowd full of democrat pedophiles
you know what her speech had youthful ambitions
@julius seizure like i said write a poem and let us see how good you are all talk just like your trump
thats so funny but its true @ the same time
@secret oktober78 terrible comment
@eevee my beloved its super overrated billie eillish sweeping the grammys in a nutshell which was rigged see the parallels too much pretentiousness for me i dont mean to disturb your illusion that everything is gonna be okay
@julius seizure excuse me but why mind explaining what you hate about what she wrote/read aloud
@notlkk there wasnt justice but it was just us corny puns that were overused takes a little to impress yall dont it spoken words that ring true just because of the color of her skin what does token even mean
@angel 1973 youre a lot more fractured and not as strong as you think and its not what i see on the news where do you think i live
@julius seizure we maybe fractured but we are not weakbelieve that and we are more together than what you see on the news
@julius seizure why dont you write something for us to critique lets see what level youre on my bet is below 9th
@konjotora you think a unified us is the only hope against communist china thats adorable us couldnt even defend 400000 americans from an accidental pandemic and russia was able to fill the us with domestic terrorist us will never be unified not to mention the uss own healthcare education and justice system being used against them if its not antivax school shootings opiate epidemic etc its something new
@julius seizure youre never written a single sentence in your life that anyone would ever want to read nice try at racism though f off
@secret oktober78 that election is over and one for history to reveal to us in time for now lets focus on china and giving kamala a chance shes young and in her prime
@julius seizure i think shes 22 and a harvard grad her confidence to speak at such an event is amazing
@only1rb this is the future of the america i want knowledgeable proud of their unique heritage and wanting everyone to have a seat at the table going forward a truly unified usa is something the whole world needs and is the only hope against communist chinese rule
@mr meerkat she writes at a 9th grade level
yeah including the new president
@julius seizure *22
periodtttttt
shes 14 and this is deep
@konjotora its more people than that  votes were changed stolen election oh well she did deliver a beautiful poem she might lose points on the left with her name not ethnic enough
@konkyolife i said the same thing she was on 
@abu lahab she just confidently offered an olive branch to 75000000 people in good faith and sincerity perhaps she should be vp next time
we need another meryl streep dont we
for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it wow
unbelievably honest and raw but hope is what we bring forward
they made all these new rules about staying inside for our safety today fortunately most gopers know its a lie to cover up the fact that barely 100 fans showed up to cheer on their president trump 2024 (at this point ill take don jr or ivanka) thank you father and in his name we pray amen
after a long time of being ashamed of things our country has spoken into the world i feel patriotic once again 3
shakespeare turning in his grave

@germangirl dont vote lot of factslot of delusion it seems
3) the test that is used for this virus  is called a rt  pcr ( poly chain morase reaction )test this test run over 35 threshold cycles will trigger anything as positive meaning if you have a flu you name or any other coronavirus(we have more than one)and you got millions of them in your body  will trigger positive to 80% world health organization aka mr drdrosten( supposably after consulting with (well payed )virologist epidemiologist globally recommended this test to be run at 45 threshold cycles will trigger and 89 to 94% false positives your experts especially faucy is very well aware of this  and then the accounting anybody that dies with covid(aka any virus) dying of covid see below (apprx2 min) https//youtube/tw9ci2pzkzg there  you got your 300000 fatalities  since the virus has not been isolated they have to use characterized stocks meaning something that may carry the character nucleotides of the virus this is not medicine this is fraud  just a little critical thought

@spyder well then you could have said it just like that you can still change your comment appreciate your honesty at least you got some integrity a lot of others do not admit mistakes and thats what america is all about
@germangirl dont vote i understand what you are saying im not saying to wear what she is wearing or talk like she is talking all im saying is that you should be positively influencing people around you it doesnt matter how you do it
@spyder when americans behave like true americans again i can stop you know it is wrong there are teenagers or young woman in here reading this and somebody is telling them they should be like somebody else come on now i have an issue with that some young woman cannot achieve these looks or afford expensive clothes or can not read that well and they will try their whole life to be like somebody else or perfect picture model from a magazine  its sad
@stephen hatt ur name is stephan
@germangirl dont vote stop pls just stop
this is a horrible statement there are plenty of children out there that are talented that have their own individual personality they do not need to be like anybody else so what are you telling handicapped children who are trying and trying and never achieve that that they are worthless because they dont look or talk like her wow well to anybody that read this be yourself and proud you never need to be like anyone else you are special just the way you are
wise words
@unclebobunclebob so you open your mouth and then run away huh typical this is why this country is in this mess that is in should be ashamed of yourself
@unclebobunclebob sickening the height of your insanity absolutely disgusting
@germangirl dont vote yep theres no pandemic nobody has died yet anywhere in the world as a matter of fact people are starting to come out of their graves yeah thats it thats the ticket

biden crime family

amanda future president
biden didnt win  the election was stolen
lmao
a little hero for girls empowerment 
a actually found it annoying
heavily guarded inauguration spectators other than a handful are not allowed the miasma of secrecy and distrust makes me think of beijing after the tiananmen square incident where the important issues were swept under the rug and may never see the light but this girl is indeed inspirational should we all appreciate in this country the opportunities we have had the freedom we have enjoyed the courage we can feel the dreams we can dream of
beautiful
from amanda gormans 22 years old bronze pounded chest the historical recitation of her inaguration poem the hill we climb when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never ending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve graved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and the time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gaze not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that will forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolence but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merged mercy with the mights into might with right a night then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with every breath my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the gold limbed hills of the west we will rise from the wind swept to northeast where our forefathers first realized the revolution we will rise from the lake when cities of the middle western states we will arise from the sun baked south we will rebuild reconciled and recover and every known nook over a nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid the new dawn balloons as we free it for there was always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
decently summarized one nation
1 over 10 thumbs down to this it is sad but the reality and the reason why speeches like this exist
the best part of the show she nailed it 100 percent she is the future we hope america should be proud
not my president this guy is a communist and he stole the election

well said

it has been a while since meaningfull words like these have been spoken herehumbling
president trump did an excellent job for all americans  u too sweetie 
americas funeral was today truth be told it died long before this today was but a formality it was inevitable that america should pass eventually but many americans will be shaken despite warnings from both the bible and their own experience too many have listened to falsehopesellinghucksters stop listening to them heaven and earth shall pass away but jesus words abide forever god never promised to preserve america and it is frankly long overdue for judgment this country forsook its god many years ago apart from the obvious abominations american churchianity as a whole has long been a stench in the nostrils of god american christendom has largely honored god with their mouths while having hearts far from him we are certainly entering a dark time and in all likelihood we are entering a prophetic time may this shaking cause those who were looking to something or someone else for hope to repent of their idolatry and hope solely on jesus christ and his promises for those who are truly following and hoping in christ already may they be encouraged that our lord has gone before us in the world we were promised tribulation but be of good cheer jesus has overcome the world (john 1633) the floodplain of the jordan as it were may be upon us be ready to contend with horses (jeremiah 125) when communication is confused and stifled from haters of god in big tech know that god always hears and his arm cannot be shortened when your earthly liberties are uprooted completely so that you appear to be dwelling in an unrecognizable place know that liberty in christ is all that ever mattered and jesus and his father promised to make their home with us (john 1423) we are pilgrims on this earth just passing through to the celestial city while in chains at midnight paul and silas sang hymns to the lord their god while the prisoners listened to them why if the son makes you free you are free indeed (john 836) true liberty was never purchased on parchment in 1776 true liberty was purchased on a cursed tree nearly 2000 years ago many men died to purchase some earthly liberties for several generations here on earth for which we are no doubt grateful but only one man was worthy and willing to die for the sins of mankind to purchase souls for all eternity what can compare to this amazing grace you may take my country and even take my life but you can never take my jesus from me while we enjoyed many liberties in a land of plenty those things that can be shaken will be so that the things which cannot be shaken will remain may the lords will be done while it is sad to see what has become of a once godfearing nation (in many ways) it is good if the lord sees fit to let it all crumble that we might know that he alone is god and the he alone liberates captives our outward freedom was never promised on this earth but our eternal freedom was promised and secured by jesus christ himself which thing no man can deprive you of we have the same task today as we had yesterday which is to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness men can separate us from our families our friends our liberties on earth and even our lives but who can separate us from the love of god (romans 83738) maranatha credit serves christ
thank you amanda for raising the baton of hope
this is a sad but glorious moment of our republic to rally from despair to hope and understanding of what it is to be a democracy what we endured wasnt politics it was nothing more than fear motivation and manipulation of the minds of ill informed participants of a failed regime we have the opportunity to heal and move on to make this nation greater than ever before
will we ever stop talking about slavery ever  doubt it
i liked that
ok we get it just put your hand down already
napoleon dynamite happy hands club 
this girl should have worn a grass skirt

phillis wheatley reborn just so beautiful profound and moving
this recital will be one for the history books so good
very beautiful
why does the american left claim to love their nation while sharing exactly 0 of the beliefs held by the free white men who started it true americans my ass
@niall_994 you fundamentalists are absolutely insane if we still went by their rules african americans would be enslaved women would lose almost all their rights poc would be legally oppressed the country would have way less civil liberties the country and people in it are what makes up america not some old dead people who havent ever seen a phone
@memphis stef the nation is theirs they define it and if you dont follow their views and beliefs then you are not a part of that nation you just live in its area
@memphis stef i take the view that was taken by the men responsible for the usa existing
you have a demented view of what actually being an american is
beautiful in all ways
just gorgeous what a beautiful experience to watch this young prophet speak thank you amanda gorman
in 7min she was more brightly accurate than 4 distant regrettable years with trump
wow beautiful
such a talented woman a poem so powerful in content so passionately delivered the uss first poet laureate and such a very good choice
so basically the truth is now known and all is forgiven so past mistakes are laid to rest so america isnt now going to war all the deciet and lies twisted like a vine by the sun news and others all the conspiracies carry on causing fear and upsetthe new fear we are over populated at 8 billioni accept all from laureate yet wool is been placed over the general publics eyes many fear for our futures and children still many lay in poverty globally
amanda gorman is 23 years old i am so happy to live in a society that includes people like her who can use words with such power and emotion its impressive and inspiring
powerfullllllllll
ive heard her three times and i still get goosebumps this young lady will go far  and be heard far and wide
she is amazing
amazing
nice little ditty too bad the party that claims political opponents are domestic terrorists puts a shame to her words unity healing lmao
so good i want to listen to it over and over again
best part of the whole inauguration
one young star has put all politicians and the world in a humble shade a shade we only can leave by embracing lovenature and its sun again thanks amanda for being a beautiful and honest sunlight
outstanding ms gorman
god bless everyone  we have a new beginning starting today lets all come together and build back strongerbetter and healthier then ever 
this was amazing
awsome
what an amazing poem america be proud of your children greetings from munchen/germany
awesome queen 
extraordinary poem
you know is bad when they use you only because youre black
@juan valdez youre disregarding her talent lmfao thats not an opinion
@cencres so i cant have an opinion
they chose her cause shes talented tf is ur problem
forgive me im british but did anything remotely moving or more uplifting come out of the gob of ivanka(melania is barely literate) as for don jnr  (first class wanker) as we say in england
correct quote  our blunder becomes their burden thank you amanda for this emphasis america is now burdened by trump mess
i am highly impressed i hear you your words reached me
beautiful indeed

this is proof that our words do matter they have powerful meaning beautiful poem and something for our people to live by
i agree lets censor everyone
every american needs to watch this when they loose hope  
she was great 
wow  beautiful
beautiful what a wonderful poem and reading
was that a hamilton reference
to the people who disliked this why
@sc parker no she was vilifying racism people can change whereas racism is evil
because underneath her flowery idealistic language she slipped in the vilification of 75 million americans weve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy she and her ilk dont want to build bridges they want as she says to merge might with right use their power to decide what is right
best moment however 058111 is basically a ripoff from obamas speech
@nate mattingly agreed nate thats the euphemistic standpoint middle ground could be homage
theres a literary term for that and its called allusion
ora chiudete gli occhi ed immaginate che il discorso lo abbia pronunciato donald trump non ce la fate vero
i liked the bit where she rhymed it with it
this gives me so much hope
there is always a light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
impressive
15000 people rightly were in awe of this amazing young woman1 and a half thousand asshats gave it a thumbs downspeaks volumesguess who they were
to amanda ~ here was magical genius inspired and bold moving on the future a golden light foretold
bad president and ugly vice president
ugly inside for sure
the last sentence was dangggg
damn this is what u call a poem amazing
a time where a skinny black girl decadent from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becomig president only to find herself reciting for one chills i love her
you cant murder our babys and get away with it

transcript when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade we braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gaze not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promised glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid the new dawn balloons as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
this is great
very talented and very beautiful sister and daughter of zion  however jeremiah 614 kjv king james bible they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace lamentations 417 as for us our eyes as yet failed for our vain help in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us king james version (kjv) lets be awakened true israel 2 chronicles 714 king james version 14 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land thy kingdom is coming we must appeal to our messiah the one with the dark skin and the woolly hair   the banner will fly again once more forever

biden/harris = broken and token
yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life
thats quite the profound speech to her master joe as she speaks on behalf of her democrat party plantation establishment that has dominantly and consistently prevented her race from making more forward progress
maya angelou would be very proud of this young poet
there is always light if we are brave enough to see it if we are brave enough to be it  amanda gorman
her content and delivery were brilliant she spoke truths in such an inspiring way beautiful inside and out 
just an fyi  this is not a poem she was merely giving a speech
just an fyi  youre incorrect
over 40 million extra people turned out to vote for joe biden a man who cant get a thousand likes on youtube and everybody hates so much that they have to block him offcome on manjoe you cheated 
no proof so keep it moving trump is gone but maybe he will have another tv for you too watch
even as we grieve we grow even as we hurt we hope even as we tire we tried that we will forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division that hit me deep in my spirit your words holds healing and power young lady thank you god bless you and god bless america
blessings upon her so wonderful
did anyone notice that this poem is just a normal speech with a vocal affectation
no because it was a poem what you wanted a limerick
absolutely amazing
please friends dont feed the trolls just yet just sit back and enjoy yourselves a bit its been a long 4 years one thing is certain there is no cure for stupidity so dont even bother
absolutely i feel that if trumps bad behavior along with his worshippers hadnt received so much attention from the press and on social media this monster wouldnt have reached the extreme level it has
there is definitely cure for stupidity heck i still think im stupid but i know that im still need to learn to improve but there is no cure for ignorance tho some ppl just refuse to move forward or better themselves doesnt matter how much effort went into showing them a better way
you said it it has been a long four years
nothing about god in this poem what a shamble our country is in to not recognize our creator
#awesome so good i watched this video three times proud of our natural beautiful young lady
a poem recited with a dignity and purpose that shames the passing expresident and his divisive bigotry and hatred
impressive 
thunderous applause

yes indeed lets all be the light
im black and dont care
lets lay down our arms and reach out our arms to one another

@gabrielle s https//youtube/j3a6n_1owpy 110
@gabrielle s just because it didnt happen in this video doesnt mean it didnt happen i saw it and she was being disrespectful just as the lady in this video was being conveniently you didnt notice when it was the other way around though good luck finding new things to complain about posttrump lol
@mr meerkat your the problem i never said white woman and i didnt watch the full inauguration maybe you should make that comment on a video where its shown because it holds no weight here its not in this video
ya well i saw a black lady scrolling on her phone no more than 2 minutes after biden was introduced and began speaking show a little respect for your new president and for the person up there hypocrite
excellent profund
super wow 
i feel blessed to have heard this you are amazing thank you
she peeled outta there when she was done she could have held back a moment and taken in the praise she deserved humble lady moving poem
or maybe she just needed to pee  dc in jan is cold
as someone who has done public poetry reading many times  when youre in it you feel strong focused empowered as soon as the readings over youre back to being a little squeaky mouse trying to find a hole where to hide people who like attention dont become poets or writers d
i was just about to comment this you can tell she is humble through her body language all around incredible young woman

bravo

yes time to lock yourself in your house for half the year and watch the economy collapse the future sure is bright
now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us how did out all this water get in my eyes
well a catastrophe did yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life

exit polls revealed that 63% of genz voted for biden so as a 17 year old i have hope
@{blackrain} {blackrain} #fbi
@jack mcgrath she is definitely not cool but hypocritic
@jack mcgrath hi im aware this is the internet but i believe i never saw an argument on here thats not capable of being civilized unless you can tell me a good reason why it cant be then im all ears  (dont take any offense to this i just genuinely want to know why thats your opinion)
@wohb #opsquad by gas l think you mean petrol yeah its pricey counterbalance that with totally free healthcare cradle to grave including prescription drugs l dont need healthcare insurancebritish system
@paul kenneally hopefully you enjoy your gas prices
@salty gorilla racist wow its ok youre jealous becuase she is successful and you are not
yeah a future as a 3rd world country
this poem was garbage
yes indeed
@paul kenneally that because sjw shitholes like california and new york are overcrowded by woke brainwashed ppl
@ramj0y oy vey  thats racist what about asian womens
america died in november you are living now into a totalitarian communist state gg
@paul kenneally what you call bitter and enraged at everyone i call someone who actually had the balls to not hide in a corner like obama and other past presidents did thats why they hated trump so much he wasnt afraid to speak out lets see biden do the samebut i think we all know whos really in power here it aint biden he is merely kamala harriss puppet cant stand her either less than a year ago she called him a racist and she said she believed the women who accused him anything for power and who better than a man who clearly needs to be sent to a nursing home i could name a few things trump has done but i dont know where youd stand on what i believe was good or not but ill name a few things building up our military the trade relations with china declared worship as essential during the pandemic (while everyone else wanted to keep everything closed) and should i mention unemployment dropping dramatically low thats only a few thingsand within 3 days biden is undoing pretty much everything and screwing the entire country hell im not the biggest trump fan but damn id rather have him than this guy you really think biden will be any better what exactly does he have to offer that he has hairy legs or that im not black since i didnt vote for him
@smooth annie maybeas l see itall djt did was crush america shame because he was a fun and charming guy who became bitter and enraged at everyone spicer comeycohenbolton etc what did he do for america the days after the election play golfrefuse to attend the inaugurationled a riot dont americans deserve better now watch as his own life disintegrates divorcebankruptcyprison even exilenothing should be ruled out
@paul kenneally and now the stench of biden has arrived
@tri truong hope is not a method
@tri truong it is delusion and deception nothing more
agreed she gives me hope
@ethan mariani idk when i saw the comment thread i didnt really see anybody getting too offended
@iron thx for the hint but why easily offended
@ethan mariani im talking about when pill bug put the snowflake emojis
@lh sd im not deeming everyone a racist though even though there are racist people in this country i was talking to a person who was claiming that this poem promotes naetivity and stupidity that is just wrong the whole poem was about rebuilding our country because it is far from perfect people are just looking for excuses to hate on her
@iron 
@ethan mariani they called you a snowflake somebody who gets offended easily im pretty sure thats what it is at least i dont use tik tok
not a good future thats for sure but a future nonetheless
yes pretty sure the infrastructures are built by poets
yes they are in america of all races these young people are our future and we are proud of them all
@edward smith sure smh
i am not a fool i am reasonably intelligent (despite your bias slant) i believe biden won fair and square fake conservatives want to invalidate black and brown votes from urban areas your position is essentially translate into the new jim crow caucus there you go
@edward smith if you belive biden actually got 10 million more votes than obama did youre a fool
@i made an account to comment of course thats what he did thats what rascist do skin color first
not when evil people steal elections they dont
@ethan mariani i bet if trump said that exact same speech you would love it
@cory goodman sorry matetrump lost popular votelost swing stateslost georgia ffslost all court filingslost respectpaid less taxes than me or youoh and about to lose millions in the upcoming divorceall the best
@paul kenneally trump won biden cheated pass it on
so glad her parents didnt choose abortion
@i made an account to comment no its because there is literally no way how she is promoting naivety and stupidity its just people hating on the color of her skin
@maria rogers is she a activist said she was a poet
yep its just what america needs another activist without a real job she could be head of new speak
i think she was a gift from god yesterday america needs a great voice and she was great
@ethan mariani youve triggered all the woke puppets with one comment
@giavannie gianguzzi no country is perfectand we have plenty of idiot politicians here as for responsibilityjoined army at 17served in germanynorthern irelandfalklands and bosnia now retired i did my duty
@ethan mariani you seem to have no idea what youre talking about
@confusion  well it appears his comment referring to me being full of communist illusions has been deleted that was his response to a light hearted comment from me when i asked for an explanation he comes back saying communists dont know theyre communists due to brainwashing or something along those lines maybe im missing something
@giavannie gianguzzi djt used to be charming and fun(home alonesimpsons etc)what happened he dissolved into a strangenarcissistic persontruly mocked and unloved outside of his country 400000 dead americans from coronavirus economy in ruins and a failed coup are the legacy i wish that wasnt the case watch now as he abandons everyone to save his skinstarting with his family im not jealousl know that if l fall ill tonighthere in englandall my years of work and savings wont be wiped out to pay my medical bills good luck and stay healthyas for donwell he will continue his luxury lifestylenot paying taxes (his own words) and not care about america
@confusion  fair enough
@afro hammite01 thats a risky thesis
@derbasierte so true americans are just subjected to old white people now ideologies change and the new generation of people will be vastly different from the ones taking position in our government now
@ethan mariani dont all democrats
so true
@jay coops though i am confused how is he saying that youre a brainwashed communist just asking out of curiosity
@jay coops in all honesty im neutral and just trying to keep the peace so no i cannot answer that question because i dont side with either of you but im still trying to understand both of your points
@ethan mariani i hope you have or never have children youre to unstable
no thats how america might end thats how the true people of the usa will become extinct
@{blackrain} {blackrain} i wonder whats your vision on how america should be
@confusion  ive attempted to see it from his point of view however hes saying a whole load of nothing every time he responds since you seem to side with him whatever point hes trying to make will you be any better at explaining the reason why im a brainwashed communist
ahmen to that 
@jay coops   i know this is far from the topic but it would be nice if you could try to see from his point of view instead of responding with childish comebacks i recommend you do that if you want a civilized argument but thats none of my business because im in dreamland
@salty gorilla facts though
@salty gorilla so funny 
@jay coops i cannot be in dreamland because biden and obama are not present here
@ethan mariani youre the one in dreamland bud
@jay coops you must still be in sleep mode like 90 % of the people check out the incarnation of ahriman on rudolf steiner (use online sources)
@ethan mariani well as expected that was a load of drivel they way you type reminds me of the anticovid conspiracy warriors which have been out in force over the past year
@jay coops the problem with leftie communist people is that they do not realize they are communist because of the hefty brainwash over the last 50 years in the western hemisphere
@saww sawwy if back to normal means deep state and gate to hell you might be correct
@saww sawwy hate is a typical leftie coomunist transgender excuse in order to contorl free speech
@saww sawwy hat is a typical leftie communist excuse in order to cotnrol free speech
ethan mariani you are fraught with hate and disgust i thought you claim to be conservativehahahahaha hypocrite its over we are back to normal history will remember her sorry she is already trending all over the world
@ethan mariani care to explain how im full of communist illusions then lol
@jay coops yes
@edward smith your being deceived
@vivi 
@mjskillz23 she isnt
biden touching girls compilation
@witch please ethan mariani probably cant understand the complex words he probably can only understand words like huge wall bigly and very strong
thats what im saying
@noah ziegler forgive me but biden got 81 millionthat makes him the winnernot only electoral collegebut the popular vote tootrump twice lost the popular vote but won 2016 but that is the system
@paul kenneally for words are you people actually real or bots can you people be so docile as to what is coming now
comment  swsweetheart race make money and decides countries my family escaped socialism see all these lil spoiled brats will soon come to realise pets dont eat at the table
@jay coops i hear south korea elections are safer than americas is this true was the election won by stupidity and brainfed lies
the world the world 
lol her hand gestures kinda stupid
@mikhailabakunin yes the handmaids tale
@t everett thanks didnt think youd get it since i didnt post pictures with the comment but good for you
@mjskillz23 haha good one
@t everett lol yeah sure of course it doesnt lol man if i was as stupid as you i wouldnt publicly announce it lol
no she perpetuates racism that doesnt exist
she is full of sh** and this new administration and the last few president are too
never doubted it
@ethan mariani shes probably 200 times smarter than you actually im sure of it
she wrote an amazing poem theres no changing that
yes young black women will save americaagain maybe just maybe this time round they will be recognized by all of america
day dream
@kiddo matt what do you mean how does my comment have any relevance to what you just said or did you just assume that i thought the election result was rigged
@i made an account to comment oh come on stop acting like you live in a vacuum
@ethan mariani 
mikhailabakunin get ready they are preparing now for a better america
@sirmo joe and jill = white knights
yes i was losing hope for a second we really needed this
america has so much untapped potential this fine young woman was noticed by jill biden randomly saw one of her recitations when visiting her school and was impressed by her
shes not american shes wakandian
@s s williams agreed
@paul kenneally 74 million votes i wouldnt get to excited

@edward smith they dont want great democracies they want whatever keeps them preferred and everyone they hate stepped on
@s s williams true dat
if only they could just get the chance
@ethan mariani boo mr triggered man get over it your man lost so what this is how great democracies work get over it
amazing young lady
@ethan mariani bruh shut up she speaking facts
this comment 
@ethan mariani what are you even on about  do you even know what communism is
you must be full of cliches or watched too many movies
@paul kenneally haha
@ethan mariani are you writing from your basement trying to avoid the feds wont work mateyoure toast
@witch please and did you make that assumption because you also see a difference in skin colour and just assumed that this was about race even though no one hinted it except for you
@ethan mariani based on what did you even hear her poem or did you just glare at her skin
@ethan mariani promoting people just like yourself then
already the stench of trump has been dissolved
hehhehhehe she referenced hamilltoonnnn
love that hamilton reference history is indeed watching
@ravenousmama harleylover thats so great thank you

my favorite line is if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright but a truly breathtaking performance
congrats president biden vice pres harris

wow this is inspiring
awesome my poet sister
only if we appreciated poetry
many many  congratulations amanda you hit this countrywhere it should count very proud and correct
she could be reading a recipe for chocolate chip cookies and id be mesmerised by her poise and tone
for sure  loved her stage presence a class act
that is the funniest comment that i have ever read haha  you have a really good sense of humor
@jimmy george could you give me a reason why racial injustice is not something someone would bring up when talking about american struggles when slavery white supremacy and segregation make up the entirety of american history dont worry you cant just because you want to stay ignorant to the fact that poc are treated differently doesnt mean the whole country should as well
@kayanosolos yes it cheapens what they do when they have to bring up race ad nauseum get a new tune
@jimmy george if youre talking about her than you not only ignorant but absolutely disgusting thinking that talking about racial injustice cheapens something that you could never compose so gracefully in your entire life is just pure idiocy you will absolutely never do write or preform something close to that especially if most of your day includes you sitting in you ass miserably trying to bring down such a talented intelligent young lady go do something better with youre life cause this aint it
she stinks we know how she got that job and she had to cheapen it all further by bringing race into it lol
but fr tho
@san cambly yes my fact was correct communism is biblically a tool of hell no opinions here but thanks 
@san cambly greta tombberg was way more articulate and wasnt a race baiting man like this dude 
its fake
facts 
@salty gorilla oh year im going to take the word of someone who want to inject disinfectant into my arm to fight covid you got to be kidding go away troll
@bailey ballin now whos looking uneducated salty
@bailey ballin even a real gorilla is smarter them salty dont waste your words
facts her spoken word game is on point she is my new current inspiration 
dont be jealous 
@san cambly amanda would not be proud of being praised while another person is being put down in the very same sentence specially putting down gretta whom i bet has at her age accomplished more in her life than you
@san cambly wait a minute just wait one darn minute arent you democrats for greta what is this about bad mouthing little greta
@salty gorilla does her being a harvard graduate mean anything to you do you have a ged
@salty gorillawhen i see your kids on something like this im going to laugh and boo at them dumb akids
so sad with these comments i am reading
@san cambly just stay the way as you are youll would be doing us a massive favor
@deezle berbingson it wasnt broken but more hardware technology had to catch up to the software software is still far a head of hardware
@lashan yes but her diction was off and those pretentious hand gestures were a distraction
@john smith so all we have to do is make the necessary advancements in hardware to fix our problem
@deezle berbingson i worked for cia from 1998 to 2000 we were developing that software it 24 yrs retired (network engineer and programmer) the hardware technology wasnt up to par when writing the code it seems they are using the code now with much improvement
@deezle berbingson  recognition software  i think you missed the point
@john smith you can be colorblind all you want until you realize facial recognition software isnt
@deezle berbingson 20 x seems better that orange traitor turned the white house into race issues and it seems we are going through it again this hate between the races needs to stop i am really sick of all races i guess i am color blind i see people trying to push their agenda no matter who it steps on
@john smith watch it in double speed and put it in its entirety as voiceover in that deep house song you keep hearing at the store
i thought it was lame

you cant poet unless you poet
and grace and elegance its not something you see very often in the youth of today she was refreshing and inspiring
my sentiment exactly she is stunning and i was hard for me to concentrate on the rest i
@laughingsaint isnt she a beautiful young lady i think anyone who cant see beauty and intellect in her is blind or just being obnoxious
@salty gorilla they mentioned it on cnn also anderson cooper interviewed her she was quite impressive she is a smart young lady and an incredibly talented poet
@jesse baker  whatever you say dumbo you probably also think that blm/antifa burned down cities all year for equality 
@salty gorilla no we didnt its the people on the right that has made it that way so stop blaming the dems
@san cambly youre a big man for comparing a 14 year old kid to a 22 year old now how does it feel for a teen to be more accomplished than you will ever be
@jesse baker its what you angry little ppl on the left have made it 
hell ya im in love 
@salty gorilla wow thats what this country has come to
@bailey ballin why in the world would someone not be impressed with this young lady omg shes smart beautiful voice and so pretty on top of everything what is wrong with adults anymore 
@salty gorilla she is the first national youth poet laureate (won in 2017) she also published a poetry book that and her alma mater being harvard its safe to assume she is incredibly smart and dedicated to her passion also that she did indeed write the poem
@salty gorilla he lied tooooooo much
@sakal nikeo oh sht bc she said she wrote it  wish all you leftards wouldve taken trump on his word for the past 4 years
@salty gorilla just did some research and not only did she write this poem (and many others which are just as great) she is also a recent graduate of harvard university so yes this woman is smart and then some which was pretty obvious from the start 
@salty gorilla anderson cooper interviewed her and she said that she wrote it
@salty gorilla ahh yes complimenting a female in any capacity indeed makes you a simp very wise mr salty gorilla 
@tb wms you know this how
@salty gorilla jill biden discovered her at a reading yes its her work the girl is awesome period
@jesse baker youre saying that based on a speech she delivered you dont even know if she wrote it you speak as if you know her life story 
make all of the jokes you want but she is a smart woman
simp
i literally sat there watching her and forgot i was on a call 
this made me smile  zoe  canadian neighbor

@amadhaun22  yes maam  speak truth we all have a job here  no two r alike

we should all accept that a corrupt senile guy got more votes than obama without even campaigning
amanda gorman is the face and voice the usa should have to outshine the unsavory emotions which are present in every country
im sure her skin color had nothing to do with her being picked to do this
ah you are the do the research type i see

shes phenomenal and amazing
watching from canadathis lady should run from president in the future such poise such determination such eloquence its been too long since weve heard anything like this while cartman was in charge of the circus at the whitehouse
biden is one of the uss worst warmongers in recent history yugoslavia iraq afghanistan libya syria ukraine
maya angelou reincarnated in this young lady and she has added her own flare i am proud again lots of work to be done but it has been an excellent day
my mom cried after listening to this i may be a canadian but i have family in america she is talking like a true american

amazing  amanda and joe biden both have speech impediments reminds me that speechlanguage pathologists make a longterm impact
what a great day for poets all around i personally walked away with so much from amanda gormans poem this morning my favorite part is there is always a light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it written so well and spoken so eloquently what part of her poem goes home with you today is there a part of her poem that you strongly believe in or may change your life id love to hear your positive thoughts
my math teacher sent me here
i see 14 butt hurt trumpers
so beautiful
proud to be an american
well done
brave enough to be the pure light
omg she gave me beautiful goosebumps i love her
so delighting 
the fact that people disliked this video shows that we are so far from equality and unity but were getting there whether privileged people like it or not
@brooklyn collier youll never be free until you stop blaming whites for your failures the whole culture of race baiting is what holds you back it seems the democrats have ruined your people forever past and present
@encore baby also if you knew anything about impoverished communities and why they are mostly poc id suggest looking up about our entire countries history and how the government made sure to not only put poc in these already run down neighbor hoods but also how the war on drugs was a ploy to keep those communities poor even after segregation and jim crow ended poc are being prioritized because we never have been and our previous president did nothing but perpetuate that poverty not only for poc but for everyone underneath the 1% one day at a time dudeyoull be okay if youre not first in line
@encore baby its an easy google fact checkbiden never said that in fact he said he wouldnt be discrimating against any one with the covid relief bill its up to the rest of the reps in congress to actually pass it bidens words (as always) are being taken out of context by sore losers
@encore baby a covid relief bill has to be passed through congressanyone who claims to know politics should know that also where is that tweet you speak off never once saw him call out everyone but whites and maleswhen it came to covid relief if youre refering to the 1% im sure your not even close to being apart of that percentagehe said the priorities were 1) everyone wears masks which people still arent doing 2) 100 million vaccinations which a select group of people claim they arent getting and 3)reopening the majority of schools which i assume you wanted please explain to me where the priorities excluded white people do you only believe that your being excluded because poc are becoming more included hmmmm
@snore lax if you knew anything about american history and the current climate you would know that alot of this countries previous/ current policies actively and blatantly worked against pocto the point of us still being effected by those decisions made by our government officials some examples are jim crow laws the war on drugs and over policing black neighborhoods her speech actually spoke on unifying everyone in the sense that poc deserve to be apart of the same america that white people boast about all the time you need to understand why our history had such damaging affects on poc and how long my ancestors (and now my generation) fought/are still fighting racism on the micro aggressive and grand scales we do not believe in an upper handwe want to be 100% equal to our white counterparts if you dont understand that then i hope you get well soon
@encore baby how far did you reach for those statements what specific policies are you speaking of that work against men and white people id really love to know why your lying just have things fit your narrative
yes now lets make policies based on the color of peoples skin progress
this was riveting and spectacular this is a poem that history will set beside mlks i have a dream speech
@reaver red 
@jjfoff me too and l am not even an american (english) what a performanceit will be studied for centurieswelcome backamericansthose traitors will wish they hadnt called in sickamanda thanks
you could not be more wrong about it you seem to be a victim of total delusion
first time ever i have tears from listening to someone poem or speech i replay and watch it again

it truly isi have to hear it again and again
democracy can be periodically delayed but it will never be permanently destroyed   that is black excellence in every way
@ac you are the one sounding dumb right now  i will repeat it for you  amanda gorman is black excellence in every way  kiss 
@getit goingon i didnt deter you say what ever you want
@getit goingon i know right sounds so dumb haha

yawn
once again the american is now again making a history first 2008  2016 1st african american president barack obama and first african american lady michelle obama  now finally first african asia american woman kamla harris  now lets the united state of america heal from all of what we went through with our now former so called president trump had done wrong for us and start a new chapter
13k white supremacists didnt like this video
dont like election being stolen = white supremacy now this whole event is hypocrisy
absolutely beautiful
https//wwwyoutubecom/watchv=aa_ufmjeunat=3s bidens full inauguration speech
shes amazing
she sounds more presidential than all presidents of the us since jfk with all best wishes from germany
aloha excellent speaker/ excellent words a privilege to listen to a wonderful voice reciting words of hope promise of a different and hopeful beginning be well
reads as a better speech than it actually is i do want to say this i have never in my life cared for biden not even a little bit with that said in 2016 when trump won the republican nomination i swore i would not vote republican while he was president after the way republicans behaved over the past four years i likely will never vote for one again i voted for biden as he was all we had to oppose what was easily the worst president and hopefully the closest to a dictator america will ever have i realized during this time that all the criticism i have had of every single past president was unwarranted in comparison so i offer this while i do not care for biden i think he has done an amazing job trying to be president since the november election since we have not had one in four years i am luke warm to kamala and i understand our politics are largely different but she and joe will work for us so regardless of how you feel know that this young lady is right we are not working for perfection but a system we can work with i think we got that here so thank you lets look ahead
@mr meerkat nice to meet you maybe somedays our paths will cross )
@slayeroffiction that shows maturity and humiliation on your part like you i have those qualities
@mr meerkat well i am told i dot the is and cross the ts at least in history and go to another indepth level on facts in general i suppose thats true i ended up reading three biographies on fdr whom i did not like before and previously liked trump but after reading his two books and three others well no so i understand your statement completely i am not always right but i try to be as accurate as possible i get my ass handed to me from time to time and like a grown man throw a fit insults then come back and eat the crow p
@slayeroffiction i love ratt probably the song back for more is my favorite but i like round and round too lol the fact that you can remain objective is probably what triggers sis but its important i think to remain that way its just beneficial to my mental health personally but i struggle with it i admit at times to stick to the facts or at least what i perceive to be factual if that made any sense to you
@mr meerkat one thing anyone who knows me well will tell you is i only use facts so much so my ivy league sibling tells me to shut up ) never cared for slayer where i grew up was an ac/dc town i was more of a ratt guy myself )
@slayeroffiction i just thought it was interesting what is your name about you a slayer fan lol
@mr meerkat had to look that up sounds like a medicated star system p
@slayeroffiction primal zodiac sign
@mr meerkat thank you but i would remind you that trump is the one who called democrats and anyone who did not support him his enemies we will do ok not gonna get what we want but we will be back on track chugging along curious what makes you choose meerkat as your name
unfortunately your fair and sensible pov doesnt jive with the new with us or against us regime
beautiful
amazing delivery well donebody language superb
just wow amazing left me speechless so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but to what stands before us
love the references to maya angelou mlk jr and lin manuel miranda  were there any other allusions i missed
the granddaughter of martin luther king
whooooo cares
no need to be salty judy
wow 
beautiful  
i hope and pray that this womans poem today is mentioned in every history book that talks about this inauguration this poem had most famous political speeches of all time vibes this should be remembered alongside every historic line of speech from american history
so poised and graceful 
i love how they claim to unite the people but the entire poem is about how what half the country believes is evil rofl pseudo intellectual garbage that appeals to the lowest common denominator the world is laughing for sure
she is amazing she overcame a speech problem herself and wants to be president in 2036 id vote for her

beautiful poem from a beautiful young lady
well done amanda damn you nailed it left me with goose pimples what a gift go for it girl presidential elections 2034 not a dream anymore
incredible
perfect
nice rhyme
 bring out that singing parrot 
hope for the future
i usually dont enjoy reading or listening to poetry  i prefer prose  but i listened to ms gorman and enjoyed it thoroughly she may force me to reassess my view of that written and verbal art very well done
dont everyone know that is a muslim
thats wasnt a poem that was a speech how is that girl anyway  
wow 
usa is so screwed up from now on thanks
this is our america 
yes mamm so sweet i loved it

wow what a great poem beautiful
wise well beyond her time 3
and your voice makes a dying moose sound lovely
okay ms future president 
i hate the message hate biden but damn this was a good poem
compare this class with the stinking hordes we saw on the 6th on the same spot two americas choose
left speechless wow just wow
ive watched this 5 times now wow
there is always light if we are brave enough to see it if we are brave enough to be it wow
see your face when they demand reparations
wow just wow amazing young lady
brilliant 
i cant imagine what people could dislike about this video enough to vote it down
@albin mrespectfully her speech was more an example of prose than poetry i suggest doing some research on the difference between the two
@liesmith agree to disagree to me and many that heard it it was not a poem respecting others opinions is a part of embracing the message of unity that our president stands for
@mr meerkat what do you mean no timing or verse structure did you hear her speak
@mr meerkat it literally is a poem though they arent speaking their truths theyre speaking a falsehood it might be one that they believe but that doesnt make it true it uses rhythm rhyme and metaphor to evoke strong emotions poems dont need verses i think that the people complaining about it probably expect all poems to sound like limericks
@liesmith it does sound more like political prose to me no timing or verse structure passionate yes but i wouldnt call it a poem calling people idiots for speaking their truths does not embrace bidens message of unity 
ive already seen two idiots saying it wasnt a poem so i guess thats the best complaint theyve got in truth i think it bothered them in a way they cant articulate because theyre part of the problem and lack the capacity for introspection
trump supporters what do you expect
hate is a powerful motivator
dislikes
this young lady had me in tears what a great poem
am glad i watched with my daughters
what a moment her words were amazing yet i am trying to understand why there are 12k thumbs down (
bc trump supporters
i dont they are down voting her
she did such an amazing job
she has the power in her voice 
she overcame her speech impediment and her talent flourished https//wwwnprorg/sections/bidentransitionupdates/2021/01/19/958077401/historyhasitseyesonuspoetamandagormanseeksrightwordsforinauguration
amanda stole the show
@jimmy wilson yes trump is that and more
blessed gifted and brilliant so inspiring
im proud    
and change our childrens birthright
wow amazing
i dont t think i breathed the whole time she spoke our new ms angelou she touched me just as deeply as maya always did hand to my heart
beautiful and very touching
beautiful 
bravo amanda gorman
that was amazing and inspiring and beautiful
mr president dr biden madam vice president mr emhoff americans and the world when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit  its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our enaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy in change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the winds swept north east where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerinsed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
thank you for sharing 
hey thanks so much for posting the words to this now i can read it and save it
its even better written thanks for taking the time to do this
thanks for transcribing this going on my wall xx
this is the next maya angelou what a wonderful young woman
 im proud
this speech gotta be turned into a song
being european you just singlehandedly restored my faith in america what just is isnt always justice wow
@k b youre freakin hilarious from what comedy show are you surely people like you cant exist for real
figures a european would say that yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do must be in your blood trump life
such a beautiful compression of compassion and hope thank you
grace is amazing when presented with truth and purposeful intent
@jesse armstead i hear you 
love and respect this brought me to tearstears for hope and and tears for healing thank you amanda gorman
et en plus elle est jolie

blown away man so classic this girls poetry and also looking amazingly beautiful and charismatic
hhhoomme rruuuuuunnn
a new light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
@betty boop the point is the nazis used disinformation to foment hate and insurrection this is exactly what the altright is doing down
@omegamanxxx give me a break with your drama they were citizens rightfully protesting about election integrity at least they didnt burn down innocent peoples businesses and assault the elderly in the streets like blm

@k b you got it backwards friend the people who stormed the capital took a page out of the nazi playbook on november 9 to november 10 1938 in an incident known as kristallnacht nazis in germany torched synagogues vandalized jewish homes schools and businesses and killed close to 100 jews
gigi
@abu lahab yaaay
@k b you embarrass us all
@ryan ford oh no whatever theyre smoking is making them nuts
whats new this is only obamas 3rd term
@ryan ford i dont sounds like the kind of aggressive delusions a person gets from staying awake for far too long on methamphetamine
@k b mate wtf you smoking cuz i want some
your going to be it yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life
amanda gorman black poems power time is now too change
that poem just ignited all the hope thank you 
knowledge from the spirit of gods
wow
thats it i am going back to russia 
where a skinny black girl descended from slaves raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president im looking forward to her inauguration )
@sportshighlights because other countries admit and confront their faults/errors in america we build statues fly flags and elect traitorous presidents in honor of them
ocasiocortez/gorman 2034 (when amanda is old enough to run)
@steve s do you always ask questions to arguments you cant argue you didnt address what i said first
@angel passion do you always deflect to a different subject do you support blm and reparations
@steve s are you the same kind of person that had a temper tantrum when trump left 
@angel passion re you the same kind of person that stands there with your blm fist in the air screaming reparations
@steve s nobody said you had to be guilty over someones evil and barbaric actions nobody said it was your problem
@steve s calm down  its not that serious nobodys talking about slavery every single day youre exaggerating the woman in the video mention slaves only one time and yall go crazy the beautiful poet wanted to take pride in who she is and where she came from there are schools that talk about slavery but they dont go into detail they gloss over the things that happened its history and we should learn it regardless of how many years ago that goes for the next generation and the generation after that
@rosymar ramirez you said you werent going to waste your time trying to prove a point and the next 5 sentences are you trying to prove a point and you failed at doing so theres a whole system that is still very unfair to minorities not just black you do realize 23% of congress is minorities we had a minority president and now a minority black vice president that is the system you think is racist and your way of proving slavery exists today is a woman complained about a nursing home thats really a stretch i mean really a stretch
@angel passion show me one damn school in the entire nation that hasnt taught the history of slavery just one so it is being taught but does it have to be taught every single day for the rest of eternity does it have to be part of the daily conversation am i somehow guilty of slavery and racism because 150 years ago people i never met did some bad things to people i never met and yet somehow this is my problem that i need to atone for this its funny how you mention about learning from our history but not removing it yet something tells me you cheered when they started pulling down all the statues that reminded everyone of this countrys slavery history
too much fentanyl in your system will do that
@eddy love its been a month since ive been on this post i gave up lefties are mental
@kevin nonwork ok now that were facing the past n repairing it can you please get a job n quit living off my hardearned tax dollars
@clint beastwood lmao these jokers are hilarious huh
@beki_ bean07 you will never be able to relate so im not even going to waste my time trying to prove a point its not about a slave or a race card theres a whole system that is still very unfair to minorities not just black educate yourself you will never understand unless youre black theres a lot thats swept under the rug the other day a lady was complaining about a nursing home where her mom is because most of the nurses are black and she feels theyre not good let that sink in
@sportshighlights thats why i mentioned that you cant say that a jewish person has never done or felt that way especially during the aftermath of those events because history will always create tension between people no matter how long ago it is and thats just the sad truth social media and the internet tend to focus on the most loudest and fanatic of opinions which is not reflective of the wider discussion regarding slavery that the average person engages in in fact i find videos like this to be a lot more toned down and realistic history in america has not been recognised to nearly the same extent as it has in germany in a lot of parts of america slavery is either very sugarcoated or ignored all together so it doesnt surprise me that there is still a lot of heated debate about it today
@pramma gunio thats what im trying to say there are zero accusations against germans for the past actions there are a lot of talks about how bad it was etc but there is nobody saying directly because of u my grandpa died which is constantly being used in america black people keep on saying stuff that is directly accusing you of slavery etc when you werent even born for 100 years thats the problem
@betty boop thousands of white men died to end it lmao all im saying is that we shouldnt forget history my post arent selfrighteous and drivel btw
@angel passion so do you feel uncomfortable posting your selfrighteous drivel about slavery which ended in america 150 years ago because thousands of white men died to end it on your slavebuilt iphone get to it with your fake principals and do something about modern slavery if you really care
@beki_ bean07 in usa black women has three to four times (243%) higher maternal mortality risk than other women the risk changes locally in new york city risk is twelwe times higher seeing chasms like this will reveal us where equality in not actualizing in society
@clint beastwood slavery is affecting through racism and as a racism the core point of racism is that its always structural and so is slavery slavery is part of history of racism not so long ago so of course it has an effect to nowadays racistic structures and not just that by studies we know that traumas affect socially about five generations that may be why white people have so big need to forget slavery and deny existing racism  we still cant face the doings of our grandgrandgrandparents (that may be hereditary not just socially but also biologically through epigenetic system luckily genetics are not the absolute law) usa is still holding some racially unequal laws based of time of slavery and just after that you also have surprisingly much more prisoners per capita than other western countries and black men has overrepresentated among incarcetated ever considered whys that (in addition i really was chocked when i learned that in part of united states person still isnt plenipotent after going through their sentence but it may be they still cant vote i find that totally unbelievable use of justice) in usa black women has three to four times (243%) higher maternal mortality risk than other women the risk changes locally in new york city risk is twelwe times higher ever considered whys that what comes of children who will lose their other or both parents and why is usa one of the few nations still not legally given up executing its under aged humans seeing chasms like this will reveal us where equality in not actualizing in society sad thing theres no society with no need to try to find these chasms
descendend from adam and eve please
@sportshighlights hello what you couldnt be more wrong just about every country has an issue with somebody over what their ancestors have done scientific studies show that current plights black americans face can be directly tied to the horrors of slavery  being kept from owning land from stockpiling money to pass onto descendants etc in terms of history slavery is alarming recent everyone points to the civil rights movement which really did nothing to atone for sins of the past only making things going forward better  which is *something* but not nearly enough we should keep being reminded about it until we *do* something germany isnt reminded about the holocaust nearly as much in politics anymore why because they actually did a fairly good active job of making things up to the survivors of their crimes against humanity it will never be enough but at least they try and are sincere in their efforts the united states has rarely been sincere in their lack of attempts to provide recompense for slavery
@clint beastwood i swear if yall hear the word slave yall are quick to say stop dwelling on slavery and get over it you act like her whole poem was about slavery chill
@clint beastwood why would we drop it 
 ill be her first husband 
same here and we both know biden and his son are bad people
@john daker nobody was dwelling on slavery in the comment section besides the poet wanted to remember where she came from is that okay you act like her whole poem was about slavery 
@john daker forgetting slavery helps in whitewashing america just because you dont feel comfortable and cozy talking about it doesnt mean we shouldnt
@sportshighlights she literally never accused white people of anything bud she was just pointing out the significance of how much progress has been made in the country youre reading a bit too deep into this its really not weird at all
when will we have the conversation that the government cant and shouldnt replace the missing black fathers in society indefinitely its so normalized that the gov picks up the pieces of broken black homes that men are not even part of the conversation anymore
@sportshighlights its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it amanda gorman we have to face the realties and tragedies that have took place so we can repair and move on pointing fingers wont fix anything but being quiet and ignoring the realty wont fix anything either to move on we need to come together and fix the past we cant just say the past is the past because if we do then how will we ever move on the effects of slavery and racism are still seen in the us today its a matter of people not feeling attack by the mention of slavery but instead joining arms to acknowledge and move on
@kevin nonwork oh pleaseget a different hobby already will ya
@clint beastwood guess i am the only one agreeing with youohlook at the flying 
@clint beastwood we are still living with the ramifications of slavery why should we avoid talking about that because it makes people uncomfortable
@clint beastwood i bet you want to drop slavery but keep all the other history that happened during that time youre one of those white people who prefers not to hear what makes you uncomfortable sorry but its history continue to be consumed by your bubble
@clint beastwood slavery is her history
bro a good poet doesnt make a good leader or politician
@clint beastwood why lets not forget what was done so it never gets repeated again
@clint beastwood i think you forget that that last living slave had died 50 years ago not just descendants of slaves but an actual imancipated slave let that sink in you act as if it were so far in your history that it should be let go i hazard to guess that you were alive at the same time as this individual
@rosymar ramirez america was not built by slaves slaves were used primarily for cotton and manufacturing of textiles
@clint beastwood america was built by slaves lets not drop the slavery subject its part of our history
@clint beastwood no
@clint beastwood i cant breathe
@jam who is slavery affecting in the united states today what are you even talking about
@alex everyone already agrees slavery was bad so what do you mean by making sure we dont make the same mistake do you actually think that slavery is making a comeback
weird how my other comment was deleted
@kevin nonwork weve been facing the past for a long time now at what point can we all agree it was bad and then leave it at that
@clint beastwood no just like christian churches wont drop original sin slavery is our nations original sin and we must face the past if we are to repair it
@clint beastwood why does it make so you uncomfortable
@sportshighlights funny how you mentioned germany despite the fact that the country consistently makes the effort to remember the history and are always having conversations about the holocaust and other atrocities so no its not only america that does this history can be ugly and you cant expect to be coddled and sheltered from what has already happened also you cant say that a jewish person has never done that history is complex and still causes tension between people
@sportshighlights my point wasnt to point at white people to blame them because of their history this is so we learn from it it wasnt my intention to make it sound like we are pointing fingers so i apologize if somehow that came off wrong what im saying tho i believe people should learn about all the wrong doings from our past so we dont make the same mistakes that is all im trying to say about the topic
everyone did bad things all world countries but guess what nobody is accusing someone else of ancestors behaviour only america again u guys really are kinda weird tbh
@alex point is in us u are constantly returning to history and keep on repeating it in history europe was one hella bad place and we all know about these things but no jew has ever gone to a german and said u burned my ancestors in gas cells and balkan resident came to italy and said u have betrayed us in ww2that just stupidity on next level tbh
@clint beastwood stfu
@clint beastwood just if you thought of slavery not just an american white men crusade story but as the most despicable mistake men did and the biggest victory the human kind achieved youd probably agree with their descendants standing tall in pride for being free youre welcome
@clint beastwood slavery is something that still affect a lot of people to this day so why should we stop talking about it when theres still so much to uncover and so much to change this doesnt make any sense
yes they learn about slavery in school they dont need to hear it from absolutely everyone
@clint beastwood no because sadly that is our history but we need to let every generation know so we as a whole dont let that happen again and we wont allow history to repeat itself so no we cannot drop the subject of slavery
@clint beastwood the ignorance 
@clint beastwood can you just shut up
can we drop the slave crap already
dr biden lmao lol

@pink lemonade lol
@abu lahab being emotional isnt having mood swings stop being such an armchair psycologist
you actually need a psychiatrist to sort out your mood swings
beautiful work we can see in the comments that people are wanting more poetry less celebrity
the words are meaningful and the diction is impeccable
brava amanda that was extraordinary
the power of eloquence may her words resonate and become reality 
powerful
let us embrace the dawn about which she has written and spoken there is immeasurable power in poetry
such a profound poet  m not an american but i am moved amanda
anyone catch the hamilton lift history has its eyes on us
@cher osborne absolutely to me both references were clearly shoutouts to hamilton the musical
@kurly kayla thanks for that sugar bugger maybe one day you will wake up with that beautiful natural hair and realize you have been played i know the shackles on the democrat plantation are comfy but free your mind and your a$$ will follow ask candace
@secret oktober78 google what a clapback is youll figure it out honeybun you seem to not understand the situation for what it is so lemme break it down for you we won you lost we matter you dont youre irrelevant you always have been so stay salty with the weak anonymous clapbacks thats all youre good for bye 
@kurly kayla oh never mind sweetie enjoy the illusion that a 47 year career grifter who has a segregationist background is gonna help you
@secret oktober78 i do it every morning boo yall comin in with the weak clapbacks in 2021 
@kurly kayla go pick your fro
i actually thought a john legend song with that title
@secret oktober78 this isnt about you ok sit down
also sit under their own vine and fig tree no one shall make them afraid
she confirmed that the two lines of that were hamilton references
@pls argue with me same
i went to the comments to see if anyone spotted the hamilton references
@secret oktober78 what
is hamilton cultural appropriation or can only whites offend btw i have no prob with the play just curious
omg yesss and then the sitting under our own fig tree i already love this girl
yup she tweeted lmm to ask if he heard both of her hamilton references
she asked lin manuel on twitter if he got the two hamilton references
thanks for pointing that out i looked up the reference cool
@cavers either way its brilliantly captivating
even napoleon by the pyramids in egypt but great poet anyway congrats to america to have poets laureates  and use them let poets talk only they say the same old things for the first time
definitely feeling hamilton while watching this #hamilfan
@larry wang she mentioned that scripture said
i dont know if shes referencing hamilton or if hamiltons referencing history
also the scriptural reference to sitting under own vine and fig tree

wow
brilliant and beautiful and inspiring love it
she shines brightly in a mostly toxic environment hopefully her words will not fade into background while the nation festers in the forgotten and downtrodden
@you tuber you are the reason people hate americans
@you tuber but friend the only way you could say that biden didnt have a large turnout is if you werent going to count mail in ballots before the election all the polls had biden way ahead florida ohio and iowa had the lead shifting between biden and trump throughout their whole campaign the mail in ballots though had trump scared the whole time he often talked about how he was going to pronounce those mail in ballots as fraudulent if he lost and thats exactly what he did but he can only fool you his followers not us who are in a more neutral corner
@mark mandel youtube took it down  leftist censorship everyone i shared the video with cant unsee it it was on sky news in the hearing the lady said this has been debunked and it was replied this is the first time weve shown the video how can you debunk it
@mark mandel if i recall wberyone denounced the racists but said there were good people on both sides of the statue argument its clear you are just taking the media narrative
@garey gordon he may not have won but we wont find out because the fbi media judges military industrial  govt workers and republicans wanted him gone so they turned their face to fraudulent activity whats interesting is that in dem areas poll watchers were allowed biden had low turn out but in key areas they kept watchers out he had huge turn out this is called voting irregularity and statistically impossible all the court cases were dismissed due to no standing saying that they didnt have authority to launch an trial even by bidens turn outs when he would speak you can see people werent that interested
they wont man as long as there are people who want better for america and live for hope and light and unity who want our children to continue crossing lines in the sand between races financial statuses and anything else that promotes division words like these will come to mind to keep everything bright i love your comment
@garey gordon those kids parents paid for their kids to be sent to the border via human trafficking (coyotes) blame the irresponsible parents not trump
@salty gorilla i bet you loved the way he orphaned those six hundred kids
@you tuber why do you think trump won
@salty gorilla you mean the people trump constantly lied to and cheated didnt pay their due wages or prices insulted and whose enemies he refused to denounce (there were good people on both sides) and told to wait a little this wasnt the time yet (proud boys  stand back stand by)
bright star 
@you tuber cant be forgotten 
you mean the ppl on the left who attacked trump everyday for the past 4 years
@you tuber can you give me a video link
@mark mandel i saw video evidence but it didnt matter there were over 100 affidavits but it didnt matter i know fully that it doesnt matter what is true or not they can even manipulate the media and the people eat it up you will find out in 2030 when they collapse the us to seize power wait and see
@you tuber ah yes lies evidence please or its only a thought whereas trump told something like 20000 in his term in office but you know that they were all true even when he was contradicting something hed said before riight
a beautiful poem for the power structures new pawn the media made up lies and ran a campaign against trump and his supporters shame on the media and shame on the democrats for going so low disagreeing about politics is ok but what happened the last four years will not be forgotten
@doug carpenter trolls cant stand the sunlight it kills them
its true she is a bright new star of hope
it wont as long as we are brave enough to see the light and brave enough to be the light 
@witch please youre right i fell for the troll bait  i love your username btw 
@syd vicous he knows that hes a racist projecting onto a woman thats better than him
@ethan mariani how so the poem was about moving forward as a nation regardless of our differences that regardless of our hardships faced the american people can stand strong together to build a better future for those that follow
isnt this an act of racism against white people
wow that was an amazingly beautiful poem how i hope america will be better with biden as president
this is black excellence 
simply beautiful
the best most relevant inspiring uplifting and engaging inaugural poem ever written ms amanda has put forth a challenge to all americans for there is always light if we are brave enough to see it if we are brave enough to be it united we stand divided we fall
yay a lesser evil
shes 23 if you guys didnt know  absolutely eloquent and stunning 
*22
this is easily the most boring thing ive seen all year though i suppose compared to trump boring is fantastic
shes a wonderful poet look also at her hand gestures as she delivers he poems wonderful just absolutely wonderful
i feel like she had more movements but they got toned down for those giant microphones in her face
totally an embodied recitation theory of embodied cognition applicable here it seems to me body over mind love it
put or differences aside what the hell was with all the riots before than when trump was in the house or even obama no this whole praising this poet is bs and shouldnt be done very little of what she says is good and thats if u take it out of context shes just theyre for the fame money and reputation nothing else its disgusting if you ask her of course shell not say it but deep down that is what shes there for and again its absolutely disgusting theyre is soo much i could bash about but ill shut up here to see how many of yall get upset side notno i didnt take the poem out of the context of what she was trying to get across rewatch youll see (which is what i meant earlier in my comment
see this is why i hate politics people cant even come up with a fuckn reply/argument to the things i say people are just to pitiful
@d t may i ask in what way was trump a puppet or let me put it in a better way what has he done or evidence that has been widely proven that he is a puppet
@zyth so youre saying biden is the same as trump gotcha
@idk what im doing here several but mainly because people are supporting such a person like joe biden who is a puppet edit put very shortly
whats your problem just asking
ozajstny hiphop
alright girl nice poem
wow 
great job young queen
figures there would be 12k trump fans on here downvoting a speech about healing and unity
i cant imagine giving a speech after this amazing articulate lady
beautiful

even as we hurt we hope raise this wounded world beautiful
most beautiful day in america in years
exactly 4 years lmao
the star of the show
perfeita
i almost shed a tear every year its the same bs woman is starting to sound like a broken record
the hill we climb amanda gorman when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in in all of the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it that would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can periodically be delayed but it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burden but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it

this was the best part by far

 senile incompetent joe biden our new fraudulent fake president that is in bed with china who gave the world the chinese coronavirus and terrorist sponsor iran who wants to wipe the usa and israel off the map god help us all
im glad for my fraudulent president and it wouldnt be the worst to wipe the usa out and no one cares about israel unless you are from there
source trust me bro
im not american im european ive questioned americas sanity for the last four years but when i see young strong americans showing their love and passion for their country i remember why america once had the appeal of a land of promise
for there is always light if only we are brave enough to see itif only we are brave enough to be it  mic drops  522
weve learned that quiet isnt always peace in the norms and notions of what is just is  isnt always justice what a queen
stupid quote
@maiva  cool story bro 
@salty gorilla youre literally triggered by the fact that a black woman who was reciting a poem was called a queen people are called a king or a queen based off of what they say or do not because of race youre contradicting yourself and you just made this whole thing about race again you sound dumb lol

@salty gorilla perfect name youre so salty cry somewhere else salty 
@maiva when was the last time a white woman was referred to as queen just for reciting a poem lmao it wasnt bc of her words i didnt make it about race just called it out and that triggered you 
@salty gorilla you sound so dumb people call her a queen not because of her skin color but because of her words stop making everything about race
@denise have fun reporting peoples comments and liking your own comments 
@salty gorilla go cry somewhere else salty 
@denise millions of others i dont think so denice the video got more down votes than likes 
@lucy renee it was a mic drop to me millions of others  i throughly enjoyed it shes so great 
correct it was definitely not a mic drop none of the poem that was shes simply looking very nice and neat her skin is lovely and her hand movements almost like a dancers or sign language interpreters there was nothing moving in that speech for most ados (american descendants of slaves) blacks/americans who have gone through hell in the us shes no young lauryn hill or tamika mallory those two spoke truth to power they didnt tread lightly with some word salad in order to please those in power or seduce the masses with the idea that there is unity after what happened at the capital on the 6th as yvette carnell said unity without accountability is oppression there can be no reconciliation or unity without acknowledgement biden and his vp need to seriously address a number of things instead of sweeping them under americans filthy and raggedy rug
soothing words for the people who destroyed tens of thousands of businesses last year from the pulpit in front of the capitol the tens of thousands of people who rioted vandalised and intimidated the public hear words to soothe their troubled conscience and give them absolution because grandma would understand them now after all if there is no justice there is to be no peace and this attitude prevails in a country thick with laws from the young poet america gets a c grade it barely passes the nation is still in a position though to lift itself up and now do what is right though so far america has been a naughty vile at times and selfish child can do better must do better
@stallone123 in the uk they say king and queen bc they are referring to a legitimate king or queen of the country in the comment el dum dum is referring to an apparent poem writer as a queen presumably bc of her skin color 
@julius seizure wtf do you know about a little black girls experiences you couldnt even begin to comprehend
@salty gorilla im pretty sure all people were calling white people kings and queens until america had its revolution from england she has every right to support another woman unlike you who has to come on this positive thread and act like a jealous child
@julius seizure do it better then
@salty gorillawhen we sang god save the queen whats your point
@salty gorilla you meant her majesty in london
@salty gorilla hey mayor mcdouchebag let people like the poem do you really need to make this about race go away
that was one of my favorite lines from her poem
@julius seizure wow what a mic drop
@electrikblue1008 your english teacher would be very disappointed right now and dont forget the pretentious and exaggerated gestures she makes other than that shes adorable whos a good social commentator
@julius seizure funny that now you claim you are criticizing her words due to lack of experience (when you dont know anything about her experiences) but narrow down your comment to being unimpressed by her use of a pun that was never there to begin with someone make it make sense
@electrikblue1008 still not the mic drop you think it is and no that was definitely a corny pun
@julius seizure basic grammar is part of basic education is it not you still used pun incorrectly lol 
@electrikblue1008 lmao i know it hurts your head to process some nuance but learn what that is before you argue over semantics basic grammar has failed you im criticizing the words of a 22 year old who hasnt even experience much of what shes talking about her next poem would be authentic if she talks about tokenism and privilege sit down you sound ignorant
@julius seizure learn what a pun is or the very least google it before you start coming for people basic education has failed you yet youre out here criticizing the words of an educated young poet sit down you sound stupid
could not agree more cheers from indonesia
@julius seizure itit was word play in a poem so not a pun a pun implies a comedic aspect
@julius seizure  yep gotta praise poc to be socially accepted in bidens america
really a pun impressed you an overused pun that wasnt that clever to begin with okay
when is the last time you referred to a white person as king or queen
amen
yes that part
brilliant hopeful powerful
amanda gorman thank you you are such a blessing you have such wisdom ) love you
she is too flowery to much hand movements i was glad she was finish and got off stage
@tony swe  u understand
i loathe roses too all those petals layers and layers of them so annoying (edited to add this was sarcasm)
its called interpretation shes just feeling what she wrote
agree 100%
respect how amanda simply appeared on stage and then quietly exited with grace and completely devoid of fanfare however her words and inspiration will live forever deeply etched in our souls and on the same steps where a 14 days prior ignorance and hate failed to change our lives amanda  you are a hero
proves that no one under the age of 21 should have the vote
@d t so i have to raise the bar to 26 when human brains are fully formed according to scientists no problem she should be embarrassed to offer such tripe at her age
that is a bs statement good thing shes 23
@z_viet fr absurdly understandable since platos republic only the founders dared to create a constitutional republic ordained to serve the people and not itself if you surrender that greatest dream then you are more foolish than the mob
we need a million more young minds like hers instead of narcissistic ass shaking tik tokers we need more young people who care about the future for all of us not just whats right in front of them
you didnt understand a single word be the light not the shade
well now im crying how incredible this is america at its best
beautifully rendered ms gormans poetry reflects hope truth and love her poem brought tears to my eyes as did president bidens speech may we all find our way to a more perfect just and harmonious union unfortunately at least one comment on this thread lets me know that the horrific and fearfilled birther movement continues vice president kamala harris was born at kaiser hospital (3701 broadway blvd) in oakland california for those in need of further assurances to soothe their troubled spirits read the biographical material provided https//historyhousegov/people/detail/15032442523
this kid knows nothing token black
what a beautiful poem articulated so eloquently by a brilliant young lady
well that was awesome
what a powerful word this young sister has dropped in the heart of the spirit of our nation i pray that well hold fast to hope and be guided by the power of tmh as we go forward as a nation
i cried throughout most of this poem and im a 42 year old white guy
@thehoneydeev 
i cried too
@willy wonka thats nice to hear if more black and white people shed enough tears the hard wall of fear misunderstanding ignorance and pain that divides us would soften and fall so that we could finally walk into each others hearts keep crying 
i am sure we all did   such powerful words
im with you my brother im black and cried it goes to show our humanity will always prevail the division
you are not white neither is she black my friend we are simply all of us human being i watched and was enthralled with her eloquence and dexterity much love all the way peace
i did too watching from the caribbean so powerful
wonder how fox news will rip apart this womans speech
its not a speech she is the poet laureate
a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished damn
@yael chavah yisrael i really like that last line youre clever just since youre so curious as to wonder i have had large audiences applaud me on occasion and cmon now just because she was deemed suitable by someone doesnt mean she should be doing it ive heard more than one persons who was deemed suitable to sing the national anthem for example you have your opinion i have mine or is this a last word thing weve got goin now )
@big fire pop lol her poetry was obviously deemed suitable for the inauguration otherwise she would not have been asked to deliver it oh did you notice how she received a standing ovation including the presidentelect i doubt anyone clapped for anything you had to say lol
@jeffrey hinkel more nonsense coming from you look those so called nucleus families were a bunch of infidels who bred racist idiots and monsters like jeffrey dahmer
@yael chavah yisrael ( aw such a personal attack so sad now its your own opinion to think this is poetry worthy of a presidents inauguration /shrug
@jeffrey hinkel her speech was centered around a better america apparently it didnt resonate with you and just flew right over your head your comment is nothing but rubbish
@luis medrano whats interesting is that you capitalized his name even though he didnt he knows hes a loser so hes doing what losers doput down others if one is empty and devoid of uplifting others we have to consider the source
@big fire pop you wouldnt have her eloquence in your dreams lmao youre pathetic
@mjm what
@chad leach i so disagree what platitudes she mostly spoke about our nation and we as a people not the one to be sworn in you need to listen again
@chuck i mean real d e e p
@a jones so how is this biden feller working out for you suckers  
@mercurial pierrot the country was founded on the constitution read it and then you might understand the founding better
nah its not broken nor unfinished this nation was founded on war and imperialism its the way the founding fathers wanted it to bethey werent saints you know
@v k and biden isnt lying every time he opens his mouth and biden isnt going senile and biden and his family arent the most corrupt family to be president is recent decades
and the insane comments berating a young woman because they fell for the lies of a very flawed president proves that line right even more
@patrick sapanaro all the black communities got from blm is burned down cities and a bad reputation blm is a marxist organization with a were for blacks slogan
@luis medrano malcolm x said a white liberal is the worst thing for america but worse for the black man you dont know anything about anything youve been punked by the democratic party
@christopher exactly the democrats had everyone by the balls having everyone believe there lies and only be willing to help out only transgenders
@patrick sapanaro nothing
@encore baby your response reeks of white supremacy and elitism the history of empires is public knowledge you point to barbaric pasts to defend modern actions of euro cultures thats a strawman tactic and doesnt justify anything at all id like you to evaluate what white supremacy means to you and your relation to it
how much did black communities get from the 90 million dollars donated to blm
the only good line in the poem however the left doesnt want to finish the nation they want to destroy it and remake it
@witch please biden will fail so bad in the end those words youre going wish you never said
@1995hss how is saying that usa is unfinished american exceptionalism all countries are unfinished but this wasnt the inauguration of the president of all countries but the usa
sounds like classic communist revolution talk  always the same  not taking away from the rest of it though
it is a broken nation she got that completely wrong the democrats are breaking it
this nation is absolutely broken in the trash heap absolutely no unity thanks to fraud biden
yeawell said

definitely not broken it was built this way  to be corruptand oppressive af for ados
yep and old joe will finish it off that is for sure he already signed away about 20 million jobs
@germangirl dont vote yeah i was just pretending to have covid last week laying in bed with a 100 degree fever and getting a professional diagnosis that i had the coronavirus was just an act haha no get your head out of your ass not everything is a conspiracy to oppress you
@encore baby white people crying about racism in 2021 after the benefitting from the world they rigged for hundreds of years will be the craziest memory of this century no doubt
@encore baby sir reverse racism does not exist
@encore baby and you can keep thinking the reason certain people dont accept people like the obamas kamala harris and amanda gorman has nothing to do with their skin color must be nice to live in that fantasy
@encore baby the slander is hardly constructive criticism it has no reasoning other than contempt
@jeffrey hinkel they clearly dont care about white males oh my god did you just say that you sorry old victim are your feelings hurt jeff not feeling cared for your privilege is breathtaking why dont you start a white male therapy group where you can all sit down and support each other you can complain about how youre feeling as if black folk are getting too lippy these days id love to know what the world would look like to you if people did care about white males what would that look like not that i really care i love the fact that a disillusioned racist like you us feeling unloved progress
@uzumaki naruto yes thats poetry just because you dont understand it you mock it but it doesnt rhyme 
when would it ever possibly be finished broken bones heal broken things can be mended finally broken things can be made into something new something better
@abu lahab the time for that nonsense is over trump and his slavish cult followers lost in spite of all the lies that were told you honestly believe that hunter biden  who apparently has millions of dollars  took his laptop to a legally blind suburban pc repairer in another state and that blind pc repairer just happened to know rudy giuliani you believe that well even fox news didnt believe it zero evidence ssme as election fraud claims intellectual cripples like you make me laugh 
@mjm you didnt understand it we know god you so obvious youre like the bully at school who mocks the smart kids because he cant read
@1995hss every country has these sorts of messages during leadership milestones i hate the false patriotism of many americans but this is appropriate especially in the context of the events of the last 16 days
@encore baby the multitude of people who degrade her belittle her talent and find her unworthy of her accolades
@encore baby look at this comment section to know that shes not accepted
if we dig we fig if we lie we tie if we dare we flarethe flame lol 
take it easy
@luis medrano damn is right mijo its a damn shame that so many people participate in cheating and this lie of a presidency its a damn shame that youtube continues to gaslight us by putting the statement that gropin joe is the potus when we know that is not the case
shes is african american she is smart peaceful that why she is not accepted in america
@oni jin empty words lol
@kamaka alameda lmao you just made my point if people dont agree with your view they must be a white racist that love their white privilege one might say the racist could be you for assuming i am a white man to begin with for the record i fall in the minority group not that it makes a difference i get up and work hard everyday putting in 7080 hours a week to give me and my family a better life no oppression and no handouts needed here nor do i feel the need for someone to understand my feelings or walk in my shoes what i have had is a clear understanding that if i make a child i should look after them and provide not just financially but mentally so they dont grow up thinking everyone owes them something they havent earned simply because of the color of their skin but you never did address why blm would be specifically against the nuclear family structure how can having a mother and father in the home raising the child or children they decided to make is a bad thing
@big fire pop just is is not justice i thought it was a pretty clever word play
@bunter hiden sounds like you care sounds like you are threatened by someone who has achived more in 20 minutes then you will in your life
@mnztr1 oh yes i am so threatened i dont care either way just sick of the pandering and fawning like sycophants
@manny b you are missing the oppression part and caused and reactions to oppression as a white man you dont get the issues or dont want to look at them simply because you like your privilege your viewpoint is absolutely archaic in design and perpetuates prejudice and racism
@luis medrano well her poetry sucks
the words of a fool most americans agree that the election was stolen 
@thatgirl your right im done reacting to these people i sound as bad as they do
@laura hoshaw she made references to what she research but not stated any real sources of her plagiarism
amanda gorman is a racist 
@encore baby what do you mean specifically by the political ideology
@germangirl dont vote get on meds asap
@john smith i saw her in an interview right after the reading talking about researching lincoln king etc and what words they used during times of division in this country one of the lines she got from a person on twitter but as usual you didnt bother looking for the answers thats pretty typical nowadays she gives me hope folks like you make me want to buy a rugar
no nations in the entire world are finished all nations are unfinished because all nations keeps changing adding up to what it was to comply with society progressives changing
she said just is is not justice
@bunter hiden i am not i am admiring her performance and i am not threathened by the fact she is black or female unlike you
sounds like south africa ironically south africa really is broken now
@mnztr1 stop worshiping people for their gender sexuality and/or skin color
@kyle from axetruth so true lmao
weve been teaching this to kids forever we teach them that america is a delicate experiment and needs constant protection maintenance and flexibility we teach them that the future is inclusive and a rainbow of differences we urge them to serve to seek to be stewards of this delicate democracyand when they rise up they bloom exactly like this amanda gorman is the next generation the one rational people always want those who want to take us backward are not lovers of the country in which they live they stand as walls against progress and must be marginalized by the sound of hope and change over take their hatred and aggression
the holy word of god  the bible john 3  16  21 _16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god19 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil20 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god_
@kamaka alameda so unless you walk in someone elses shoes you are somehow what when was the last time you heard a japanese person ask for a hand out or anything from the government or pitty from anyone dont forget what was done to them after pearl harbor every ethnic group has gone through alot at one point or another in the course of history as for black lives matter inc its a farse and everyone with a brain knows it if youre black and dont agree with them then your life doesnt matter why is it that they advocate against the nuclear family structure when decades of history show that this is the issue that directly impacts the life of a young child the most regardless of your race blm inc is nothing more than a marxcist organization that uses those in less fortunant circumstances and prays on them to make them think that they are owed something for what they have not been a part of from someone who had nothing to do with it
@kalypsokruz oh yeah she did claim she wrote it keep up with the times interview with anderson cooper
@john smith firstly she didnt claim she wrote it its plagiarism when one claims it as theirs also yall need to show credible proof instead of making claims that she didnt write yall so inane immature af
@jeffrey hinkel tf is you talking about you making up sh*t thats all yall do is lie
@laura hoshaw no she didnt
@mark mandel no doubt youre right in that sense it was also almost as forgettable
@bunter hiden stop acting like a frightened child
@abu lahab he was tied up
@jeffrey hinkel ugh again the ignorance you either actually know what the statement means and youre being intentionally argumentative or youre ignorant and if so evet google any in depth article on the movement just you know to be educated wait i know you wantit signifies theyre being killed at a disproportionate rate and therefore hey their lives matter too
@john smith she publicly named parts of the poetry that came from other sources research before you speak
@jeffrey hinkel huh 60 too bad you act like an ignorant preteen
i think its a reference to a speech by martin luther king
yeah and by that she means black supremacy
yes that line was incredibly wise and brilliant
@a rodriguezdice una nacion que no esta quebrada pero simplemente inacabada
@gar sm i guess since biden did it so often they thought plagiarism was an accepted activity
luis puedo tener una traduccion de esas palabras
@afro hammite01 what are you talking about you fool
@afro hammite01 and what then nothing never change from then on in demographic
shes talking about the demographic change 20 yrs it wi be finish
@big fire pop doubt you could make anything better lmao
@luis medrano im not american you idiot and what if im not white then what im racists to or then my thoughts is all right and even interesting beside im just making point all nations is in constant change( all leftist will agree) if that so how it can be finished or broken there for unfinished to is impossible
disgusting display of a paradeinstead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the american people making everything seem glamorous while this rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you  the covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way enjoy your glamorous show america
it is broken now you will see
@kar kan hey youre missing one more k in your name there
@luis medrano whats it got to do with color you racist
if is everything in constant flux how can nation or something else by finished or unfinished naive child
@jeffrey hinkel i will surely forget your forefathers thanks for the que
i know right
@jeffrey hinkel white males need to stop whining like preteen girls and grow a pair
@chad leach how unhappy are you
@guillotine garvez i do believe you are referring to melania she plagiarized the whole speech go figure
@john smith you mean like how ivanka did 
strange since she didnt write that that is a very old statement long before her she plagiarized the quote unfinished nation
@jeffrey hinkel youll probably be gone before next election anyway crypt keeper 
@jeffrey hinkel youre 60 you wont even be  never mind 
@mjm you must be another ruthless cult member 
@mjm jealousy is a sin
@jeffrey hinkel he did fail and he was booted out because hes a failure he lost his temper multiple times what are you talking about lol his [former] tweets were his rants whining like a petulant child that got his toys taken away from him then he lost and he whined even more hes a degenerate who was never fit for that office a bigot a racist a sexist a narcissist a perpetual liar and a charlatan hopefully biden can restore some class truth and honor to the office well chastise him when he messes up and well congratulate him when he gets things right just enjoy this amazing poem by this amazing young woman jeff
@mjm yea it was if you didnt feel that than you are not american
that deep
@jeffrey hinkel you can do a lot about it you can vote you can march you can proudly proclaim that black lives matter  because obviously we know that white lives matter the other thing is the generation that hold the most racist which is yours hopefully will die off soon and their children who are far more educated will rise
@jeffrey hinkel you dont walk in the shoes of a person of color so you dont understand i myself am part native hawaiian and portuguese and trust me when i say this my hawaiian side experienced extreme prejudice because of their race i myself am somewhat passable as white and understand that privilege instead of feeling like people of color hate you maybe join them march with them hear their stories hear their truth drive through their communities white people have done horrific things to people of color and yet all people of color want is equal opportunity to stand in the way of that is to be racist
@jeffrey hinkel its obvious you dont get that in order to understand the present we have to reflect on the past those who have white privilege would like us to forget about the past yet it is the reason why brown and black people continue to be oppressed there are people in this country whos grandparents where slaves and you cant tell me that they have not been effected
peace be with you
this is one of beautiful speech ive ever heard aside from balian speech from the movie kingdom of heaven and chaucers speech introducing sir ulrich von liechtenstein in a knights tale
@milada bravenec  nothing wrong with russians just that paid russian trolls would feel better than our own neighbors being trolls (it was just a joke cheers)
she drop those words
@abu lahab move around
@abu lahab lol you are so useless
@chris rogers whats wrong with russians
@bill barry you have no clue what racism really is nor do you likely do anything to fight it bill
@mjm it was to most of us do dont get bothered because we embraced her you are a minority here
@luis medrano thats poetry ok
i heard her say that earlier and tried to hear it again but i couldnt that is the best line of all thank you for pointing that out again to me this young lady has a lot together
@abu lahab omg what a load of horse crap evidence or its false

@aberd wheres hunter

@aberd thank you i thought i missed something therethere are always fools

@aberd i know when someone has been walking around in bs and chinese bidenhas been doing it for decades and i cant even say what heels up harriss feet have have been doingcause its disgusting
i know couldnt believe she came up with such a stupid line but then i remembered she just got finished rhyming just his with justice ugh 
@aberd hes literally blurting out the 3 lines that these idiots have its always the sameexactcrap such a troll
@chuck where is hating gonna get you no where so sit down shes absolutely right
@mjm your failed president lost get over it
lmao was that impressive to you
@1995hss i honestly didnt get the american exceptionalism message this wasnt a comparison with other countries i think this was just about us and our capabilities i got that deep down we know that we can do this we can do this intestinal fortitude we got this
american exceptionalism how brave
@chad leach this video is about a black womans poetry not a white mans speech
@chad leach wtf are you talking about didnt you even watch and actually listen to the video or are you just a trump troll

@barbara young oh barbara how wrong you joe stalin fans are
@idk what im doing here i see focus on the light (hmm marijuana must be legal in your state)
@maria rogers no i am not i have never used a marijuana or any other drug in my life quite the opposite i am educated reasonable compassionate kind strong vigorous and discriminating i have penetrating insight i have made mistakes of course but realizing the harm that trump and his cult have accomplished isnt one of them
@jeffrey walker wait are you that stoner guy jerry jeff walker

@d t  the internet is just too much
@jeffrey walker sure am can teach them how to aim when someone who doesnt possess nor cares to those qualities comes kicking in their door at 3am instead of a job as a means of financial acquirement can also teach small children to use pepper spray when certain creeps wanna sniff them
@the darkness came oh indeed you are capable of great violence armed and dangerous are you capable of compassion understanding helpfulness gentleness wisdom that you can pass on to small children things that represent true strength unaccompanied by swagger and threat
@the darkness came would it shatter your ego if they took away your holster im not trying to sound like a bisch im honesty asking

da oval office inda black crib

trump
roses are red bidens are blue ukraine fired their prosecution communism is ubiquitous too
wow such beautiful sentiments and poetry on your part so dedicated to the preservation of anticommunist ideals like seeing them in every corner in all walks of life in reincarnated hugo chavez in all democrats in all possible ideals opposed to fascism heil lucky clover
wow great speech or poem or whatever you want to call it well delivered im thankful for her words 
i understood those hamilton references 
who the heck is this little piece of token propaganda perhaps a direct descendant of kharmalitas slaveowning grandpappy biden did not even manage to produce a genuine poet for this historical landmark event never had time time to read any good poetry on the amtrack because he was too preoccupied with the contents of hunters laptop just askin
nah you guys support insurrection terrorism and strangling/gunning down black people absolutely no one on the planet respects your sick ideas
@william schutter no only you and the loony supporters care and why didnt you care w/everything trump has done wrong or are you just hypocritical
@d t so wrong anyone who is moral concerned for the rule of law and opposed to biden corruption does care conscience and integrity still matter to many thank god
no one cares what is on hunters laptop
1k dislikes sadly this is why unfortunately we will never be truly united the jackasses out there will never embrace honor respect and love for one another she is amazing
what an incredible poem at such an apropos moment in our history how this woman had the insight courage wherewithall to deliver this awesome poem at such a young age is nothing short of amazing thanks amanda for giving us all hope in not just our youth but our future wow
sheesh in all that darkness she is a freaking bright light that was profound and truly embodies all that has occurred simply great
beautiful 
wow wow top top top
895 hate filled folks that need love spilled upon them  brothers and sisters we are united despite those few that cant see the light
beautiful in every way
good writer it is unfortunate that the art is currently obstructed by the polarization of political propaganda i am convinced that half the country is going to believe they were called a destructive force attempting to stop democracy and that might with right means all those people who disagree need to be destroyed not very healing i would imagine
now we assert how can catastrophe possibly prevail over us well said young lady
most blacks dont give a sht about kamala and obama im one of them trump 2021

i am so proud of you amanda i am not watching the festivities live but will watch later when i am in the right frame of mind lady gaga song our national anthem too distraught nevertheless i am praying for peace and a strong unified team thank you for being apart of our great history historians today peace young lady i love you
she killed it

wahoo what an intelligent youth showering blessings words to the whole world youths god bless united states love from a humble kenyan
i wonder if the left knows its okay to have someone other than a black person do things these days i guess this was supposed to be another one of those historical moments first black female 22 year old poet laureate
and warren unlike you she is gifted thats why shes up there today and you will never be
spoken like a true racist
let me see lady gaga sang jennifer lopez sang garth brooks sang and amanda gorman recited a poem and all you can bring up is her colour
bull crap fraudddddddd
im so happy if it was fraud
amazing 
i was completed captured by her poem imo this poem is the right message at the right time and for the right reasons
what a great day for china and the ccp
a young light glowing brighter in america
robert frost maya angelou the greats are in good company with amanda gorman
amazing
very well spoken 
i guess i was kind of with her until the hawkwhistles can i say hawkwhistles does that scan im sticking with it no i dont think a country needs to be fierce nor to focus on might the ecosystem is shifting under the weight of our species we occupy every country on the planet were being aloof about the propagation and mutation of a novel viral strain throughout nearly our entire species we just increased our military budget during a pandemic we spend trillions on planes that dont fly most of our defense budget seems to mystically get lost anyway [ya know going into peoples pockets and get funneled into tacitly terrible investments which are then buried after never making returns] we nearly exterminated the entire american indian population and their culture we just banned a religion from entering our country [whatever that means] we have children in cages we tear gassed literal lines of moms were calling blm terrorists were toying around with global warfare during ecological shifts and pandemics   id like a little less fierce might in my breakfast cereal today thanks hun maybe we can focus on just being somber and focused on the 14000 timesensative issues which demand action instead of taking time out to make sure we mix fierce might into our cauldron there are actual genocides and atrocities happening right now never mind that were decaying the ecosystem which keeps us all alive maybe keep all that might locked away for a while and focus on healing rebuilding planning learning educating uniting and so on i have such a hard time with people who look around right now and think this world really needs a little more human might i am in opposition to you if you maintain that stance human might is destroying human life and having a go at literally everything else maybe leave the fierce might in the pantry for a while
oh my goodness these words of hers were just what we needed thank you beautiful lady
brilliant such a young  great talent  well articulated you go girl

its really funny to think that almost a thousand people watched this video and thought yeah this is problematic
the rap of democracy uhh rahh
whether you call this a speech or a poem it was beautiful powerful perfection she has an amazing talent and a bright future ahead of her we havent heard the last of her im sure

amazing young women speech that you can feel in your heart with hope and love for our country being honest with ourselves to me her words will always be imprinted in heart with faith and truth

i am inspired thank you
i cant stand joe biden im not looking forward to the next four years but she really did a great job
if you are a christian the bible asks us to love our enemies just like you cant stand biden there are people that may not even know you but hate you for no apparent reason trump biden or whoever else will come after they are not the savior when we idolize a human been they become god to you i think trump has done some good work but he is human has also made many mistakes but still sees himself as perfect we need to forgive one another and move on from the division and hatred
the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice wow she is absolutely amazing i love her delivery as well as her words
blacks always think theyre the victims but never mention about their behavior i cant stand it
theyre always complain white folks dont treated them right but what about asian i am sure white folks treated them better than asian
of course they think theyre the victim when people like you seem to be under the impression that they behave differently than white people
deeply moving stunning powerful poem epic delivery 
now why am i crying
documenting struggle as a black yet claim victimhood as a black nothing new to see here folks
stolen presidency
good
that outfit was as pristine as the poem itself
mr president why are gas prices soaring and you have not even been sworn in yet
lady gaga sang hope that clears it up
this inspiringly articulate woman held the nation and the world in her hands today i sat on my sofa in melbourne australia watching her speak to the world from the opposite side of the world and was humbled by the clarity with which she spoke and the way she captured the notion of being able to come together wherever you are and all be better versions of ourselves bravo ms gorman you are surely going places and our world will be in better hands with the likes of you and your generation shining a great light on the path forward thank you
being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it
@chad leach i live in the us and had nothing to do with whats happening in afghanistan
@yael chavah yisrael and bidens lost everything else glad your happy to strand people in afghanistan but at least theres no more mean tweets lol
@vault dweller eight votes or 80 million votes didnt matter the most high god of the bible removed trump from office he was too much like nebuchadnezzar trump would have destroyed this country because he was almost there
@chad leach you know what trump lost to biden lololololololololol
@juliette pierre that quote should be coined
hi dear
@chad leach hi dear
@ginny k good day hope you are having a good day
@denise hi dear
and screw fox  i dont even watch tv or pay attention to the controlled media  too much fake news  did you just crawl out from under a rock  geez
@william holt he is not a racist get off the fox and ona gravy train racism is running rampant in usa and previous person in the white house encouraged that divisiveness over and over again current member is trying to reunite all of haman kind all humans equal and to be treated equal the very fact that you saw it as a racist moves only reflects your own racism
@willett mary its a shame that it came on the heels of the biden administration a racist himself joe biden  lets face it  they placed a brilliant person  a composer a poet  a speaker of colorout front for a reason  you know it and so do i  not to take anything away from the young lady  why would i want to 
@kattywagon29 hope kids have to study better words for kids to look into and study  this is where the brainwashing starts  i had a dream too  this is not it  this is a progressive american nightmare
@aberd keep your enemies closer
@daniel hay more context please there are a lot of comments here
@moonlightonwater share a very long what
@ginny k who did you shoot
@idk anymore wtf
@denise how are you gonna say go cry yet regularly check these comments also that commie comment was pretty funny regardless of political party also poetry is pretty odd
@35oz 19g go cry somewhere else 
@dorset deb racist boy
@john woodsrd so millions and millions of dollars of property damaged innocent peoples lives completely destroyed and the deaths of over 20 people is worse then what happened at the capitol if you believe that you are a prime example of why this country is falling apart you are completely infected with political ideology to the point where truth and reality goes right over your head i truly feel sorry for you i hope you wake up one day
@bonnpoland really what do you think that line means
you cant repair the past it has already happened you can learn from the past so you dont repeat it its painful that people think that quote is insightful its literally gibberish
@nathan hatfield  so words that dont fit your narrow and incomplete definitions dont mean anything your logic is false on its face
@anne cornish it will never begin what would all those people do who depend on it never happening
@chris rogers a hero like the people that have run into situations knowing they were going to die for a chance to save others lives or a hero like the word hero doesnt mean anything if both people who give their lives to save others and people who write something you agree with over and over in the youtube comment section are equivalent just curious what definition we are using
you cant repair the past its the past
@julius seizure terrible effort all you have managed to convey is that youre a butter racist her poem was fantastic
@denise too bad i didnt hit a brain cell 
@denise why dont you enjoy your utopia on an island somewhere first see how that works out for ya 
she said history has its eyes on us basically the future has taken a look at the current state of the world and giving us all a big side eye
@daviilow805 youre making it very clear how miserable you are lmao
@willett mary our brothers in ore yes such minerals  just kidding but yes
it also they have forgotten the that with freedom come responsibility for all ore brothers and sisters
@blax poitation well the way i see it trump is a fool but what i mean by that is he is ultimately the one who reveals those who would attack the people for practicing reckless free speech i think his words and actions were twisted a lot for instance i hated that he pulled out of the paris agreement butit never occurred to me that it might just be a scam to drain money not to aid the environment the policy itself however aptly named doesnt do what it says tbh the public perception of trump and his clownery is highlighted over the real change hes done he stood up to ccp which they treat their own people like garbage no one talks about it but check out the channel laowhy86 he lived in china for 10 years has videos on what its like to live under their reign its real and the ccp being the backbone to the global economy everybody answers to them trump did not he was called racist for it everything is perception why do we need news outlets to tell us how to perceive not what to perceive
@halicarnassus83 no one who votes democrat is a patriot they hate the us everyone knows that and everyone knows biden cheated
@wnrc ltv versus those who voted for a president whom cannot even recite a single quote from the bible like trump yet his antichrist christian treasonous cult followers knelt at his feet and wanted a tyrant to rule them we the real american patriots were tired of your ilk and we voted him out the real silent majority
@idk anymore these people would vote for president someone who reads poems nicely truly useful idiots
@selena mayfield ok shill
@kbs what does trump matter here you cant seem to stop talking about him while a sitting potus you yourself admit needs to be investigated
@chad leach i believe your worries are centered on trumpexcuse me if i am wrong but that cuts both ways biden is suspect also and investigation is required in that regard also
@tyler bliss not hate or division just fear and careful reflection until you face down the concerns of those you disagree with nothing will have been gained
@k b do you really think biden is going to go around killing 6 million innocent people for religious indifference take off the tin foil hat bud its gonna be fine jesus
@chad leach youre doing the exact opposite of the message shes trying to pound into the thick skulls of people like you you just came here to comment and cause hate and division sad
@germangirl dont vote yet here you are replying to her comment you sound fragile love
@keith mullens nobody agrees with that bs 
@aberd the underlying claim of collusion was proven false flynn was convicted of making false statements not colluding with russia the media portrayed collusion as if it had merit but it had about as much merit as a stolen election (not much) it was a conspiracy theory im a registered democrat but the double standard is clear
@david turczak antiblack racist
@idk anymore i love how the second we disagree with you people you call us communists how we want to be equal we say whats wrong with that lets not sit here and act like america doesnt have a bad past and kamala harrid a black and asian woman is the buce presidentwe made historydeal with it
@fredi schwaaabe have a good day 
@vault dweller negative i wouldnt like that at all id actually prefer to engage with someone who is reasonable we may have a difference of opinion but at least theres sensible dialogue and for the record im not a bill maher fan like that and i dont hate trump or have a blind rage towards him i think he was destructive and was never fit for that office i think he conned and brainwashed some people and i believe he flirted with racism and fascism he was a blight he really brought out the worst in people both his supporters and his opposers but im more than willing to respectfully speak and listen to people who disagree with me
@dorset deb it was your people storming the capital tearing down democracy and for different reasoning too pointless political pursuits vs civil rights at least i get to laugh knowing youre on the wrong side of history
@denise they say a person that only sees the positive side is bound to fail (or stupid) tho yesterday was a day of hope for your defective country but realize that hope is a distraction from the huge fkn challenges you face be careful over there
@germangirl dont vote go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@blax poitation and yes the entire political structure is corrupt af i mean the federal bank is not a branch of our government but they print all our money we essentially owe them the feds dont owe anything to us theyre essentially just trying to get their money every dollar printed btw has interest on it we forever indebted to the federal bank these stimulus check for example are not free
@blax poitation dude youd like me so much to be the person bill maher told you i was well im not i dont care about trump i voted for hilary in 2016 you are the one who wants to gamble with our democracy bc you hate trump that much blind rage
@julius seizure could you have made anything better or are we demeaning young ladies now because of a difference of opinion
@uzumaki naruto assumptions and generalizations therefore your claims hold no importance or relevance )
@k b isnt it crazy how most conversations devolve into hitler propaganda only people who have no claims at all usually devolve into comparing hitler to anything to make themselves feel like they are saying anything remotely justified its called the godwins law you should look it up
@y w lol 54 million for trumps businesses isnt even an insurance premium while the bidens are doing personal deals with public resources but again youd rather focus on trump rather than deal with the present corruption your partisanship is showing
@princess of keys did you completely miss the bidens involvement with burisma or receiving kickbacks from the ccp
@loren rich so youd rather put your head in the sand than recognize the corruption in the biden regime
@vault dweller correction biden got more than any president 80 million and affidavits are not evidence they are statements not to mention some of them have been retracted theyve also not been swept under the rug they were brought before 60 courts so youre saying all the courts are corrupt the fbi the doj the dhs cisa the ag the republican govs and ags all of them corrupt huh all of them are wrong but whos right your cult leader yeah thats much more plausible youre delusional man and youre wrong this is about trump and biden you all want to overturn the election and place the cult leader back in office just because you cant accept that he was beaten smh the absurdity of all of your claims is both sad and hilarious
@v n room for her parents since childhood remind me of the hunger games you know that colorful dressed lady on the microphone
@denise   how can you enjoy yourself when you constantly fighting others in here telling them that you trying to have a good day looks like you disagree with many of them in here including mejust saying
@chad leach what do you mean selling out this is lime the 3rd comment ive seen and no one even put examples as to what they mean by sell out like what the hell do you mean
@new mercies she was amazing noones bitterness can take away her talent or the beauty joy she brought us 
@keith mullens keith go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
this was such a wise line nearly philosophic it is sad to see the amount of ignorant population down the comments forgive them father for they know not what they do or say
that was the sentenced which was so wonderful and true i hope the healing can begin
@germangirl dont vote go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@keith mullens go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
pure paid artist 
@keith mullens she wrote the same comment like a hundred times how is she enjoying herself with a group of people that are all against her just saying
@keith mullens go cry somewhere else keith were enjoying ourselves over here 
@vault dweller go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@keith mullens go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@blax poitation youre gullible dude he got more votes than any president in history  obama got 69 millionim also mentioned that bc many citizens came forward with signed affidavits they were all swept under the rug this is injustice the way i see it this is not about trump or biden this is about the fact that someone cheated our election and no one cares bc hey we won guyswe all lost if anyone cheats the election  no matter who it is it needs to be taken seriously
@david turczak im pretty sure we have jobs it is proven that democrats are more educated and are more likely to get a job than a republican so if anything you get out of mommys basement and get a job
@ginny k she burned the cities of those who hate those who decide not to have faith in our restoration she burned them all down

@chad leach  selling out to foreign countriestrump and russiaor ivanka and china
@chad leach you think biden is in chinas pocket what about the trump familys connection to beijing forbes estimates that at least $54 million has flowed into the presidents business from a lease agreement involving a stateowned bank in trump tower the industrial and commercial bank of china signed a lease for space in 2008 years before the president took office paying about $19 million in annual rent trump is wellaware of the deal ill show you the industrial bank of china he told three forbes journalists touring trump tower in 2015 i have the best tenants in the world in this building trump moved from the skyscraper to the white house in 2017 but he held onto ownership of the retail and office space in the building through his 100% interest in an entity called trump tower commercial llc the new york times revealed that the us president has a bank account in china his daughter ivanka trump received 41 chinese trademarks from the time she was appointed a white house adviser in march 2017 to april 2019 according to an analysis of documents the review also showed that the trademarks ivanka applied for after her fathers inauguration got approved about 40% faster than those she sought out beforehand now whos the suspicious one
@dorset deb what city was burned down
@idk anymore america spokeand it didnt want any more of what trump has to offerfascist
@vault dweller 
biden touching girls compilation
@chad leach burisma the potential conflict of interest is what i read in the homeland security doc (investigated under the trump administration) so if there were a conflict of interest im sure they would have called it out ccp hunter biden and his business partners said they had yet to receive a payment from bhrif you or anyone you know have evidence please simply produce the proof until then what are we talking about
@cocoonen educate yourself china still considers itself communist though anyone who has been there in recent years (like me in 2018) can see it operates socialist/capitalist https//wwwthoughtcocom/communistcountriesoverview1435178 russia on the other had considers itself a federal republic but still closely operates as a corrupt communist nation (putin for life) as he overhauled and abolished the independent states federal agreements and clearly cannot be considered a democracy since 2011 so stop assuming youtube commenters lack education
translation give me money
@moonlightonwater neither russian nor china has never been a communist nation russian hasnt even been sosialistic god knows how long and china well it may call itself sosialistic but cant and (would assume it doesnt even want to) deal with the system truly please educate yourself
 its the past we step into and how we repair it smh
@j m you do that commie
@moonlightonwater and are you just going to ignore bidens connections to the ccp and burisma
@idk anymore hypocrite i dont think you know what a commie really is look in a mirror
its all about the free government handouts reparations even after reparations black people would still complain about what they had nothing to do with 400 years ago
@willett mary das raaayciss
@chad leach npcs cant think they can only repeat scripted lines
@daviilow805 shhhh dont talk about that besides that was months ago its ancient history in the minds of leftoid npcs
@david turczak she doesnt have to now the democrats will give everyone basic income paid for by your taxes because muh equality
@dorset deb let antifa burn your business down or else youre a raciss natzy

@denise lmao i love the way you dgaf and keep responding with the same message 
@idk anymore cry harder fascist
@idk anymore trump likes commies putin and kim jung so trump is the real commie and authoritarian putin used trump and americas history of racism to try to destroy americas own democracy but americas democracy and institutions good people and self checks are too strong to fail when you see that than we will forgive you for your sins study american history military history and the art of war you will see the big picture of what happened and why was capitol hill attacked
@vault dweller why is that so hard for you to believe he got 80 million votes he beat trump those are the facts enjoy the beautiful poem by this lovely amazingly talented young woman and call it a day
@halicarnassus83 im not christian nor religious nice try commie
the past doesnt need repairing  just leave it in the past and move forward  sounds like race baiting to me
that got me chills
@idk anymore wow you conservative antichrists sure hate what christ preached yet you hide behind a cross of the saviour you secretly hate
@dorset deb anything that the black lives matter people or the antifa people did is nothing compared to what those assholes did at the capitol nazis are you a nazi
wow there was not one thumbs down i guess things are looking up
@denise you dont even realize democracy quietly died just now if you actually believe biden got 80 million votes  more than any other president in history you keep spamming the comment section love while we lose our freedoms in our sleep its all for show now for people like you 
@moonlightonwater while turing a blind eye to the corrupt biden administration assisting the ccp in modern day genocide glad to see democrats have their priorities lol
@aberd you really dont have any attachments to reality left do you
these are elementary school rhymes did she get this role because of her race i wish there was more she had spoken about being more than a token
ipoetry speechnewyearsdenise
sotrue lol
yeahamanda is kool  

@david turczak wow that was a good one i think you really got her
@chad leach not a waste at alltrump is no longer president now and plenty of time to convict on more than just russiagate
@sapphire opinion go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@ginny k this young woman certainly supports the kinds of people that burn cities down even though shell never live with them and probably live in a predominately nonblack neighborhood
@vault dweller go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@chris rogers its a shame that mean racist conspiracy idiots try to take the light of a young person that presented herself incredibly wrote and spoke such inspirational words shame on them
if we emerge mercy with the might ( lord jesus)and the might with the right then love became our legacy 
im sorry but thats just a pretty sentence think about what it excuses they could change up everything to repair it
i came back to this video to look for that line it just resonates in me for some reason makes me feel hopeful and that i can try harder and always be better thank you
a shame the trolls and qanons have to share their filth with the rest of us denise youre a hero
like election fraud you think biden really got 80 million votes that breaks the record for all presidents also  many many many people came forth with signed affidavits giving their witness statements all swept under the rug if anyone no matter who it is if they steal the electiondemocracy is already dead we just dont feel it yet ignorance is bliss my friends
@moonlightonwater you mean the 4 year russia impeachment investigation that wasted millions and only resulted in finding out michael flyn lied to the fbi while under no investigation after they threatened his son yeah totally the same lol
@daviilow805 dont forget the capitol that fascist desecrated
@chad leach or your leader selling out to russiadont forget both russia and china are both communist nations that share a very long boarder
@idk anymore nope fascist
@denise go denise
yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life
so powerful  akin to the i have a dream speech i hope that it becomes a speech that kids have to study in school
@daviilow805 stay miserable were enjoying ourselves over here 
@denise enjoy your smelling your own dragon breath for another year
@daviilow805 go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@chad leach lol try and keep up the russia investigation paid for itself with all the money confiscated by the doj and fbi your claims are delusional flynn was convicted and sentenced and subsequently pardoned by trump but heres the kicker get ready flynn and stone cannot invoke the 5th amendment thats right because if they do they go directly to jail and they will soon be joined by trump when the sdny gets done with him and the mannhatten ag its lights out no go cry on your keyboard before mommy calls you up for supper
ok step into the past and rebuild the cities you commies burned down
brilliant young woman

@aubrey myers she was truly amazing 
@chad leach go cry somewhere else chad we are enjoying ourselves over here 
@denise not very intelligent are you
my favorite line
@aberd are you talking about how democrats wasted millions of dollars and 4 years because flynn lies to the fbi while under no investigation all while the biden administration has clear ties to not just the ccp but ukraine as well this is why im worried your so partisan you dont care about truth anymore
@chad leach go cry somewhere else were enjoying beautiful powerful poetry over here 
@denise whos crying over that im worried especially when we have a partisan congress that would never investigate these ties scary times
@chad leach lol that would be your messiah trump he and putin are buddies

@dorset deb go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@idk anymore go back to sleep
@idk anymore go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
nope commie
biden and harris have historically systemically oppressed girls like this
@d t but as she said quiet isnt always peace and i dont think we should let viciousness and unwarranted attack go quietly it might be frustrating to deal with i agree
@jeffrey walker the cult will never understand
where do you get such notions your own selfrepeated narrow narrative
the hill we climb amanda gorman wednesday january 20 2021 when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in in all of the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it that would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can periodically be delayed but it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burden but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the golden hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
who is shes
the versed blow commonly include because stranger potentially bless since a combative calf judicious tested twine
this may be a good thing for obama for he will no longer be the worst to ever serve as president
i think tubby left today
cool humble and over whelming rhyme of a poem by an amazing poet you made us proud
better than that fat black woman twerking during blm arsons rip western civilization
captivating i dont think there are words for how beautiful this young lady is you can see her soul shine so clearly
wow wow wow
#chinajoebiden eulogized a grand dragon of the ku klux klan that in the poem #chinajoebiden our very first #pretendpresidentjoe
we the successors of a country a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one bam ouch take that in america she laid it out for us listen again #amandagorman
@andrey pena jimenez red herringed and ad hominemed me b/c you couldnt dispute something thats i said to be true politics are the death of art if you ever bothered to learn more about the subject she knows whos paying her and who shes catering to with this political stunt
@shadowiff youre so bitter that shes more bright and elegant than you will ever be expand the light and love with yourself
bam ouch how about native americans read again the ancestors of living native americans arrived in what is now the united states at least 15000 years ago possibly much earlier from asia via beringia a vast variety of peoples societies and cultures subsequently developed
and still nobody on the planet is more racist than an american black cool that she can write poems though
i wanna throw a book at her awesome young lady just awesome
gonna have a speech now by a black hispanic homosexual transsexual bisexual muslim illegal migrant and combination thereof
and do you have a point or is your little white ego going to get fragile
haters stop it if someone has nothing to say please remain quiet people will always try to discredit someone when they dont agree with them but give credit where credit is due she is 22 years old scholar
she has a super cheesy and weird ass voice shoulda chose someone else
jealousy was lucifers sin stop it as if you could have written such a poem and read it
the era trump started as a comedy show and ended as a horror movie thanks god he is gone
listen carefully she contradicts herself
@rosette joseph thankfully thats not up to you
thankfully heaven or hell going to have people of all color and creed
she is great
chillsssss
starting to feel like black people in america are put on a pedestal while us other minorities are left in their shadow like we dont work hard too like people like us that arent white faced struggles like we didnt face discrimination at some point in our lives
thats right descended from slaves i knew that was coming at some point much of this was lifted from speeches of barak and michelle
@josephine bournes of course the haters have to descend trump supporters see only race they dont have the ability to look any further i am also amazed at how may people thought this was a speech and didnt know she was the poet laureate
triggered much
dang not only is she an incredible speaker shes so fashionable that headband is so cute
beautiful 
brought me to tears maybe there is some hope for our country (and its reputation) if this any indicator of things to come and choosing the best people intelligent inspiring poised and absolutely gorgeous
wow
it is now all in gods hands let live and let god
bla bla bla
how old do you have to be in order to be president i vote for amanda through our youth we have hope amazing
brave enough to be it 
she gets a 100 even her outfit was perfect her words and look are a beacon of sunshine
full transcript when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this neverending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade weve braved the belly of the beast weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesnt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that well forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if were to live up to our own time then victory wont lie in the blade but in all the bridges weve made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare its because being american is more than a pride we inherit its the past we step into and how we repair it weve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while we once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change our childrens birthright so let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with every breath from my bronzepounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the goldlimbed hills of the west we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lakerimmed cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sunbaked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there is always light if only were brave enough to see it if only were brave enough to be it
omg you are my new favorite person 
@k b honey what do you understand trump is a white supremacist he himself is no different from hitler but you do you i suppose
awwww this is so beautiful so much glaze and beauty in it her poise is out of this world
your going to have to find light yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life

nahhh peak of american poetry was eliot and bukowski nothing more can be said about america until we start colonizing mars
two of the worst most overrated poets ever
this was beautiful thank you amanda
sorry to be that guy but history tells us democracy always fails u can change the players in this game but still the same rules and goals i pray for all the lives lost  love you all great poem btw well delivered 
wow my politics are probably very different from hers but even i can acknowledge this is one hell of a speech shes channeling dr king perfectly
amazing 
her grace is awe inspiring
incredible such wisdom from such a young person i was in tears
545 obama sighting
slam poetry lol
jesus is coming  new world order coming 2021 (un agenda 21)  fake alien invasion incoming  please do not take the mark of the beast rfid chip /vaccine  #killuminati 
i got the same vibes from little girls singing for kim jung un
whaaa cruelty itself is your comparison
amazing she embodies the beauty of america
who cares
@jimmy wilson ah yes the side more capable of violence is the right side you guys totally dont sound like fascists or anything
a couple hundred million people
add this to the education curriculum youth should study this wonderful poem for generations to come
wowww  speechless 
this is probably what trump supporters afraid of black girl speaking with intelligence and elegance beyond their comprehension what does she mean i dont get it omg how can she be smarter than me so scary give me back the 3rd grade talking guy that i could understand
these people know they didnt win
@debby utz so
@z davis a rigged election is a lie upon us all any biden supporter knows thishe lost badly 
exactly lol trump supporters just cant let it go
this is honestly one of the best speeches i have ever heard
supernova
@master joe ker seeing all the hate directed toward this young woman made me think americans are not so good my chinese friends made similar attacks on the young hong kong protesters and i thought them unfair and that much more work needs to be done in china to accept new ideas but here you guys are being equally narrowminded what a waste of your freedoms
youve never heard a great speech then this little girl is acting like she saved the world she hasnt accomplished anything she hasnt helped anyone she doesnt know anything
wow did you hear this for the first time and only this this crap was worse than watching an old lady in a bukkakke video
it sounds like it was written by amazon alexa a slam prosepoem cobbled together from instagram inspirational quotes and a hodgepodge of mediocre college valedictorian speeches
@ranger dyh amazon more like prose but tomato tamato
its a poem
certainly from her heart  ) zoe  canadian
i really love the quiet doesnt always mean peace like yassss preach destroy these demagogues
@dreams pointing the finger part of the problem when biden calls for unity it is this type of behavior that he is referring too
@dreams she said one of
amen to that
top notch
i wouldnt say the best but its a great speech/poem especially at such a dire time trump supporters dont even know how to hate on this theyre just saying a bunch of nothing in the comments
biggest hoax on the american people that ever happened shame on you shame on you frauds
@jeffrey walker what do you know about it 
the hoax here is people like you saying that there is a hoax based solely on the fraud claims of a president who told 22000 lies in his presidency who has never known the truth whose claims were repudiated by his own attorney general and homeland security chief whose court cases claiming fraud were defeated 64 times who is facing his second impeachment trial along with civil and state trials in many districts a man who can barely read
@z davis just ignore the cult they are going to need a year or two to get back in reality
@z davis im not crying its the truth you are a fraud in the matrix
keep crying about it
victorious yes lets go
poise precision passion power and heart unbelievable and humbling
this is the president we have selected for you you will abandon all protest and acknowledge his power your voices will be silenced  the swamp
brought me to tears amanda youre incredible thank you
power in a little body  wow
you go girl 
lovely and inspiring hope rekindled
lol
true beauty in her soul so moving and so needed beautiful beautiful words and message
kamala harris
one of the most extraordinarily beautiful poems ive heard  wow
inspiring young lady but above all make the united states of american a wonderful place again by promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind to talk health happiness and prosperity to every person you meet to make all your friends feel that there is something in them to look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true to think only the best to work only for the best and to expect only the best to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own to forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future to wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile to give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others to be too large for worry too noble for anger too strong for fear and too happy to permit the presence of trouble to think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world not in loud words but great deeds to live in faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you ~chistain dlarson~
amen so inspired
fake fraudulent illegitimate president
@jeffrey walker wow that sounds like the typical liberal democrat yall are hypocrites
@dr fu manchu no you are doing that flying in the face of all evidence perpetuating disinformation fed by distorted networks and responsible for inciting reprehensible attacks on the capitol january 6 most of your heroes are facing the music soon enough
you just keep telling yourself that @jeffrey walker 
oh well im glad hes a illegitimate president then
the fraud here is you claiming that there is a fraud perpetuated by a fraudulent former president and fraud claims proffered in 65 court cases all defeated except one where pennsylvania shortened its 9 day limit on mailin votes to 6 days not one case of proof of fraud and all recounts upheld
the next next of this generation toni morrison maya angelou zora neale hurston langston hughes would be proud of her
her body language adds a tremendous amount of feeling to her words her eyes her facial expressions  and of course her hands this is a very special woman
@lucia lazarte did you really say actor 
@salty gorilla so
@rohmash youre so right theres nothing fake about that talent this is one elite talented actress and race charlatan
@mark mandel lmaooo she certainly is good at what she does look how professionally you pulled the race card as if she trained you herself damn she goood my ninja
@king ghidorah no bone to pick yall just like her cause she be black
@king ghidorah he didnt lose dead voters voted for dead joe my man trump will be back in 24 mmmmaaaagggggaaaa fool
@steel pulse she healedthe nation
@latisha ok
@abby c if thats the case then have your 9yr old write a poem to help heal the nation then post it on youtube so we can all see if its so easy to do
whats so special my 9 year old could have recited the same 
100 percent
@lucia lazarte you are so pathetic she wrote the poem herself she been doing poetry for quite awhile before this
@rohmash well said
couldnt agree more 
@bailey ballin every response you write comes in the form of a three paragraph essay just stfu already karen 
@lucia lazarte im pretty sure she wrote it herself are you good
idk but it just looked like she paid attention in her class on 101  how to present something sometimes a bit over the top like she is presenting something for elementary school kids
@reaver red ok buddyi can hardly tell what your point is because your punctuation is so godawful im assuming that youre trying to say that even if shes intelligent its not enough enough for what exactly i was simply replying to someone that she is clearly intelligent and that she did write the poem that simple im not asking you to praise or worship her i was just making a point and although simply being a graduate from any old college doesnt necessarily prove intelligence graduating from the top college in the country certainly does
she works for the deep state
too bad its all bull
@lucia lazarte are you serious right now
@hooraytv21 its called sour grapes what is your problem
i love that left eye that closed at times  like a new thought was forming in her mind as she delivered her beautiful message her physicality was almost as powerful as he words such grace
@hooraytv21 sure bud its definitely acting very good insight  wouldnt expect anything more from a person who cant even use the right its in a sentence
itsits called acting
i believe theyre called actorsthere isnt really anything special about them apart from their ability to lie convicingly
@lucia lazarte funny how you automatically assume she didnt write it i know were all tired of politicians with phony speeches and teleprompters but this young woman is truly talented and intelligent she wrote this herself dont believe me look for yourself  https//enmwikipediaorg/wiki/amanda_gorman and shes a harvard graduate so shes obviously pretty damn smart
@mark mandel biden is white
@mark mandel true all that person wants is to be a retrumplican making america  grate  again amanda made the world soar with her resounding delivery
be graceful in your praise even if monetary instead of the way you are you dont leave a good legacy for your  life here on earth
she had on maya angelo s favorite color yellow oprah brought the ring
special indeed 
@lucia lazarte if you assume everypne demonstrating talent is faking where do you think the real talented people are just because you cant write an inspiring speech doesnt mean she cant
@lucia lazarte she is a harvard graduate
@lucia lazarte she is a poet and author
@lucia lazarte you really think so you think she cant write for herself that shes reciting somebody elses words then why so because shes young female and black if thats what you think i pity you
about as *special* as greta thunberg
she is a good actor and has excellent instructors who are paid to write for her money can buy everything at least for short time
very
who else is watching for a second time wow
@marina 21 https//youtube/tgpxjj7pskq
fifth time
i think its my tenth watch today 
@malvina major https//youtube/tgpxjj7pskq
and a third and a fourth and a fifthand a million

just wow shes going to go places for sure brilliant
i swear us americans are swayed too easily by good words social grandstandingnothings changed we the people are still on the outside in this pandemic without gov helpaid or reliefwe must hold them accountable to the lies they feed us daily in time well see
nobody gives a crap
incredible 
beautifully said 
bravo
well you got your blm/antifa guy installed by by america
who cares
proud of you my girl watching from africabotswanayou nailed itbravoits just wow god bless america
thank you 
powerful
amazingwell written well delivered standing ovation young lady
had to watch here because people were talking over her on peacock airing
@savvy9 i watched the live msnbc coverage im sorry for your experience but at least you can rewatch clips on youtube
@josephine bournes literally everyone couldnt couldnt shut up in fairness they were talking all through garths singing too
let me guess joe scarborough couldnt keep his mouth shut 
amazing
its the child that biden was talking about that likes to rub his leg hairs all grown up now
i got tears listening to her she is a beautiful young lady so much respect for what she said i pray that our country can unite and just get along i have so many friends of color and race but thats just it were friends and we get along and dont judge god bless everyone 
just wow 
graceful and beautifully said maam
this is the poetic vaccination our country needed let these words course through all of us and fend off the bitter political division that has been disseminated throughout our country
@hello mark how are you doing
in other words up yours trump
the left america is inherently evil and rooted in systemic racism that has no redeeming value the left the minute biden is sworn in america is like sunshine and rainbows dancing across the land with love and hugs for everyone
the right is what roots it in systemic racism good lord its a new administrations inauguration should our nation not speak of hope on this day
straight communist brainwashed girl  sad that when she sees a white person she gets scared because blacks told her that
u just scared to fight thumbs down
beautiful poem
wake up 
she absolutely knocked my sox off brilliantly beautiful
she made me think im biracial 
gives me chills
talk to em 
one of the best things about today is we dont have to be forced to listen to lies by a loser on twitter
congrats to all of you who voted for biden with a democrat president senate and house and no one to stand in the way of the progressive agenda you will soon get everything you voted for when your taxes go up remember you asked for it when your social security and medicare benefits are cut so noncitizens can get benefits they never paid for remember you asked for it when you lose your health care because of medicare for all including anyone who crosses the border remember you asked for it when the border is left open to anyone looking to freeload off the american taxpayers remember you asked for it when your daughters cannot compete in school sports or use a public restroom because little johnny thinks he a girl remember you asked for it when you lose your 2nd amendment rights remember you asked for it when you are forced to pay for college for all even if you or your children never went to college remember you asked for it when cities across america turn into chicago baltimore portland and san francisco while rioters are screaming defund the police remember you asked for it when the federal government takes on trillions in debt to bailout democrat states and cities suffering from decades of mismanagement and corruption it will be call pandemic relief or something disguised as a covid bill just remember you asked for it when they expand the size of the supreme court and fill those seats with young progressive judges so their actions will forever be declared legal remember you asked for it when our military is defunded and countries like iran north korea russia and china are less afraid to challenge us remember you asked for it you have blamed everything that has happened in the last 4 years on president trump who will have you to blame at the end of the next 4
absolutely unbelievable inspiring eloquent mighty gracious all at the same time no trembling once in such a historical moment despite being so young so impressive
pc culture in to face 
i hope one day a skinny black girl descended from slaves can not just see a black woman recite for a president but see a president who is a black girl like her
shes trying way too hard too dramatic for a speech
a poem is not a speech it is an artistic expression
ahh just so proud of this young lady 
incredible truth and hope
what a farce this is a general he knows what he is talking about https//wwwyoutubecom/watchv=mbcj7nhsec4
im bawling with relief and gratitude 
lame
and she is only 23good job
amen beautiful powerful elegant assertive empowering soul stirring ms amanda gorman
it made me cry as well as hope well done
i got chills
magnificent`~ very moving
wow impressive never again sow division
and you think thats going to happen because of her speech ok
thanks mr president who locked up the most black people in recent american history via the 1994 crime bill thank you mr president who was opposed to desegregation in the 70s
the nation is broken and the democrats with the help of the media broke it
i agree she was great the words and the way she let everything flow threw so clean and gentle yet powerful it was inspiring
words of wisdom from someone so young  from me in the uk
the scintillating slipper consistently serve because brand comprehensively pack forenenst a shaggy mice amazing noisy softdrink
great poem really impressed by this young lady
i cried 
what a talented young poet all races have talented persons this one shines (aside from the good or bad in each race creeds) many thanks to all trumps militia supporters what he $stood for today marks a remembrance day to you all in your change to peace etc making inaugurations day a better way forward for all trump must have had brain surgery his recent speechs have a mild tone but perhisusual proud boys etc never heard of them hes had nothing to do with your goings on etc
im down to make love our legacy
i suddenly remembered a part in obamas inauguration when one of the guests was bringing her kid along the news man announced him as governor of kindergarten
disgusting pandering to black people typical democrat nonsense
this is one of the most beautiful eloquent and amazing speech i have seen
why is literally everything about race for democrats
she spoke beautifully but we must listen with our hearts and not just our ears because when we turn a deaf ear to the truth we can never prevail our one nation under god will remain stagnant as before but i pray god will grant healing peace and love to this country because all men are created equal and theres one race the human race god bless america
well said thank you
wish i had print of thiswill go down in historywell done young lady well done indeed
look truough the comment someone put it down inhere   
wow this young woman is going places may god bless her and her beautiful gift
@k b maybe you and donny bonespurs can have a big butthurt partystop the hate
im sure yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life
gotta have that racial shyt thrown in or its just not a democratic function
you lost bro and will never win again the time for this who support racism and those who pretend it doesnt exist is over
she literally said we lay down our arms at bidens swearing in yall cool with this there goes your right to bear arms
@it is well canada 
the right has been talking about the left taking their guns for decades and it hasnt happened faux outrage
@zachariah most americans especially the cult supporters shouldnt have guns
@cj3madrid even if they did a small false flag psyop wouldnt give them the right to strip us of our rights enjoy your multicultural word salad and keep scrolling
@zachariah oh brother if we were going to take your guns away we would have done it on january 7 2021
@doris green theres a reason shes using a phrase about laying down guns and its not because shes a wordsmith she was chosen she is brilliant and positively a genius with words and rhetoric sure but thats irrelevant
@it is well im for americans right to bear arms you cant be for americans if youre not for their right to bear arms because shes good with words you think everything bening okay then enjoy that false innocence
laying down your arms does not take away your right to bear arms let that sink in for a moment
we lay down our arms against each other americans should always be for americans
she was phenomenal
what a wonderful speech uplifting and full of promise
eloquence at its finest the clarity is just beyond perfection hmmmmmm
the biden / harris presidency beginning with a bang  she is the best of the inauguration i want her the example for my daughters

@todd j these nuts
no
dr biden ima head out
like #4k
yes yes this made my day very beautiful we really need more of this instead of hating on each other we are all one people we are all american thanks 
i now have hope in this country right on point
the background check the nazis performed was on people with jewish ancestors ie racist screening not the screening for racists which the inaugeration security conducted
yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life
beautiful  
biden is a fraud
good for him
a young maya angelou this young lady has quite a future before her
peakae44 i thought her dad was jamaican dont know much bout politics or what not so i apologize in advance if im wrong
@secret oktober78 harriss father was from haiti and mother from south india where does the plantation ancestry come in
@aissatou sunjata what are the chances that some of the slave labor to build dc came from harris great great grand pappy plantation asking for a friend
i know the compliment you pay her yet she is not a young maya angelou dr angelou was secondary to her poetry contributions to creativity her autobiography contributions this young lady is representing the birth of someone new to the words of a legacy of wordsmiths she can certainly be considered one who represents the future but she is her own and not a young maya angelou no disrespect intended and of course you are due your own point of reference of course i guess poets are always compared or identified by someone before i look at her and see the first black female and asian vice president the exact same view dr martin luther king jr stood during his speech and the hands of those slaves who built that white house i hear them all standing proud
such fierce delivery so accomplished and so young an inspiration
oh my dear god i was moved to tears what a brilliant light she is
truly beautiful amanda  i hope pray that biden et al live up to your vision for the future
edward snowden quote these programs were never about terrorism theyre about economic spying social control and diplomatic manipulation theyre about power now covid19 its not about a virus its to destroy privacy internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the worldits about power and control

i was watching this during class and these kids were shaking there heads no as if they could not believe what was going on there isent really anything i just wanted to share what i went threw today
for all the people who attempted the coup on the 6th of january the words and deep meaning of the poem will hunt them for the rest of their lives if only they have conscience
@keith bardes any coup must be planned 
@keith bardes of course they were armed you idiot now theyre sitting in jail
keep drinking the kool aidthat was a real serious attempted coup they let everyone know that the plan was to go from the white house to the capitol building over a week before the event the only shot fired was from the capitol police because the protesters were unarmed yep seems like a planned coup to me

i see maturity isnt your thing
gotta have them blacks
the kindhearted mark accordingly float because editor endosonographically paddle upon a damp sunflower purple succinct queen
lol trash
beautiful
words do indeed matter
these are globalist scum not americans
amazing just amazing
i saw this poem delivered live a big moment
truly inspired
*stand and applauds*
mlk 2pac bob marley
so profoundly and proudly stated very moving and smoothly delivered god bless the power of your pen
these 333 people who dislike this videodo they really understand what she is saying
they are trump supporters what do you expect from them
ms maya angelou has got to be smiling down on this baby right now lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring
amen
wow if i was her i could not speak in front of the entire world
beautiful 
biden is a disgrace 
@sick86stang for sure i agree w/you on that
@d t our whole government is corrupt 
so hes just like trump youre saying
incredible
like amazing
token cards
alert conservative tears 

i couldnt tell if that was poop emojies or just your face your pfp looks the same
powerful and beautiful
i am completely blown away by ms gorman she was previously unknown to me but i will never forget the poem she delivered today truly beautiful words weve learned that quiet isnt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is isnt always justice and yet the dawn is hours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow weve weathered and witnessed a nation that isnt broken but simply unfinished damn
just like biden supporters
well said youre amazing
wow o wow if that doesnt give u chills well ur not human shes amazing the new wordsmith blm
gooooooood she is america 
the light if only we are brave enough to be it very moving wow  thank you
postraitor  illegitimate election
im so happy it was a illegitimate election
bravo amanda  bravo  extraordinary  i have renewed hope for the country
very skilled speaker
omg this young black woman gave me chills i love the gifts oprah gave her as well when i read about that i shed a tear of joyfor this young lady is blessed in so many ways i will be following her from now on
amen 
its a unique style but like a rapper poet the stops the punctuation
beautiful spoken word
could you please write down the full poem tks for sharing
ive never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings10% joe 2019
eloquent classy beautiful intelligent young lady
fake cheating dems its sickening fake propaganda hairy legs remember
im glad the dems cheated
great poem really insightful
dr biden 
speak queen 
if president trump had such a large military force and build a wall around city hall the media would have called him a facist and natzis so it looks like biden and harris are the true facist and natzis
absolutely fantastic i can see her running for a higher office
pretty average
klll all democrats

i dont want my kids growing up in a racial jungle jim crow joe biden
when they first said poet laureate i thought ehhh not my thing turns out its my thing wow just amazing
thank people like linmanuel miranda who influenced her (she tweeted him to see if he heard the 2 hamilton references she made) we need to keep arts in schools for this very reason
now its my thing too
@annabell033 fantastic comment
lol right 
wow wise beyond her years that young lady has a power of words watch that space
@annabell033 yes
poetry is probably telling more truth than the news right nowit is an amazing medium to showcase how current events (personal and communal) impact lives she was amazing
i can lie im not into poetry much either but shes so beautiful i started to watch im glad i did what a powerful appeal and words combined

i felt the same way but boy howdy am i glad i listened shes brilliant
thank you for articulating this moment in america and renewing our faith in a nation united not divided
who are you kidding we are a nation divided a little poem is not going to save the nation or is biden go talk to black lives matter and all the businesses they burned in portland
the media sucks sometimes but it definitely doesnt divide us like the republicans say the only thing dividing us is the hate of republicans mental health is a factor as well but thats another dicussion
message to the younger people you think things are bad for you now just wait another 510 years
amanda gorman god bless you you are stunning and a very powerful young lady as a grandmother of three little beautiful granddaughtersyour speech has lifted my heart in this dark times and gives me hope for their future waoooopowerful and charismatically speech
priceless stated god bless the united state of american
translation im on this podium coz biden pretends he is a id box ticker which was just to get the votes of the usefull fools blm and antifa on board as joseph biden sorry joseph stalin would say
translation im an angry white supremacist who cant deal with the fact that the country and planet dont agree with my backwards hateful ideology so im going to cry and make thinly veiled racist comments online 
beautiful
the spirit of martin luther king and all those who fought for justice humanity speaks through this wonderful young womani feel inspired humbled in equal measurethank you 
a disgrace to our country
@ghostface 7 thank you that is exactly what is happening now
white supremacist cult members who want to destroy democracy and install their conman cult leader as king i agree disgraceful
perfection expressed hope emboldened
a true heir to martin luther king jr inspiring complex lyrical evocative i listened to the whole ceremony this is what i will come back to hear again
i said to myself i want to see that performance again she was wonderful
this brought me to tears  
amazing 
this was phenomenal only a salty white supremacist could be mad at this
solid bait
omg im about` to cry 
black people are americas mascots remember maya angelou speaking at bill clintons inauguration then they passed the 94 crime bill 
great speech
wow wow what a beautiful smart woman god bless her always and her family amen and my beloved and beautiful usa  of america and my president and vice president mr joe biden and the beautiful madam camala harris and their family and co workers amen

beautiful
brought tears to my eyes i hope we can turn our country into her vision
impressive  shes also adorable i can say that because im really old
i could think of 1000 words to describe her adorable beautiful awesome articulate gorgeous and elegant 
a child shall lead us
awesome poem remember it when gas is eight dollars excuse me yen a gallon and we are being invaded by third world illegals
@ghostface 7 they wont take them they will send someone else to try they are cowards they are not scary non white people they are like locus if they had a back bone they would fight for their own country and yes i did my time in the military
@steven h bbbut da radical left socialists are going to take r gunz how will we stop da invasion of scary nonwhite people dewd 
@ghostface 7 they better be wearing a bullet proof vest that goes for anyone that might want to try
omg da brown people are coming for you bro
well spoken
remarkablemy first ray of hope in all this darkness
i feel sorry for anyone who came before or after her apparently thats everyone haha
@lisa bbb why would you be watching something you dont likethat doesnt make any sense
@alberta rivers i agree we need unity but it was never the founding fathers intention for the usa to be under a god the whole point is for it to be under no god or many gods god has nothing to do with it
yeah imagine having to give a speech after this haha
@colley hillary  she over did it it looks ridiculous n cartoonist
@lisa bbb poetry just like music performance is personalyou wanted a lifeless statuelady statue of liberty is over there
i didnt care for it either just cant stand that allen ginsberg beat poet cadence and inflection which after 50 years now just sounds like a parody of itself im more of a maya angelou girl i appreciate the message though
@kelly patrick  it looks like she is doing ballerina on a speech stage lol so awful
 yet the standards can rise we must not stand in the way or let mediocrity reign
@lisa bbb go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@lisa bbb i wonder what could be so unbearable about flowers life or movement
@blackberry4life  too flowery please get off stage
@lisa bbb youre ignorant and cant appreciate art free your mind sweetheart and the rest will follow
she is to flowery all the silly hand movement i was glad she was finish
side note this was meant to mean how amazing she is that was on the same level as martin luther king jr words cant express how amazing she is
@alberta rivers so true
@alberta rivers im actually canadian and i agree it felt refreshing to see something positive instead of the constant negative
america needs healing and love not hate look into your heart for peace and love we all live in america together one nation under god
brought tears to my eyes and made my heart swell
me too
simply beautiful
such a voice
wow what a talent i thought i was only going to stay for a minute stayed for the whole thing
all fake
injustice happens every day in other parts of the world but it is not far away  it happened in the us justice system and congress
maya angelou smiles satisfyinglyperfect
maya angelou is smiling and laughing her incredible laugh from the great beyondyou and we have done her proud your grace and wisdom young woman are beautiful to behold lets love one another
yasss
you are black excellence ms gorman
we offer harm to none and harmony to all
beautiful
a m e n 
i got chills wow
sorry but i found this rambling free verse severely inadequate (justice/just is seriously) her diction and phrasing unnecessarily syncopated and the message trite and unmemorable a wasted opportunity for poetry which has so little exposure of this magnitude
why was that bs neccessary
just wow im speachless
i was mesmerized by her words her delivery
@christina vaccaro  hang in there 
@mark haunert i did  
@christina vaccaro hey dont i get a little credit  you asked me what it was so i spent the time to look it up for you just a little humor but thats what it is you probably already knew treat animals good and have a healthy happy day 
@mark haunert ok ok  i give  good for hershe is lovely too  im just upset without my president donald j trump 
@christina vaccaro prada brand headband ( italian)
@mark haunert have we figured out what is the red thing in her hair 
@christina vaccaro what is this 

@christina vaccaro i dont play with fb why would i want to look you up anyway with your bitterness youre italian thats ironic
@dreams look me up on fb and see a gorgeous italian queen old man
who  u dont know either  do ya mark 
is she miss frisbee head 2021 
@mark haunert please tell me why she deserved to be up there today  who in the hell is she  obamas niece  hunter bidens side piece  who 
@mark haunert i dont like an uneducated opinion
@mark haunert  luved her hand jive what class
@christina vaccaroyou had nerve to call me a pervert for calling an adult woman attractive what is wrong with you are you just that bitter or what
@mark haunert good bye president trump  the best damn president ever   goodbye sir 
@christina vaccaro who cares what you think drama queen come on now why would you even say transgender anyway 95 % of people loved her speech negativity will rot your mind
@christina vaccaro well first of all i dont care what race she is im an old white guy that found her absolutely drop dead gorgeous and as far as just someone down the street  shes won national awards and i believe she a harvard graduate cant you just give a young person some support for their accomplishments
@dreams how could someone not have enjoyed such a beautiful young lady i think shes a harvard graduate also sadly i guess some people just cant just give a compliment or shut up
@christina vaccaro well someones having a pissy ass attitude about cheering on our youth sad
@christina vaccaro i bet you weigh 400 pounds
i agree totally but shes so pretty i had a hard time listening to her 
from london young lady you kicked ass powerful 
thank you 
all for what same bs
beautifully written and spoken amanda gorman is amazing
seeing sheps face after all that was jarring
so strong so beautiful so pure and those words so powerfulthank you
damn electric magnificent how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us it felt like catastrophe had been prevailing but it did not moving forward from these last hellish years let this poem be our creed we will rise we will recover thank you ms gorman
joe bidens audience for his inauguration is the military if they allowed real americans to attend in person they would be shouting *fake president fake president* and so americans were not allowed in the area we are not with this fake president that got in with corrupt voting
lol moronic cultist give it a rest
boycott communist media
wow
triumphant
beautiful young woman and poem i got stuck on one part of her poem but for the most part well done
what a beautiful inspiring young woman the future is bright
brilliant 
power and beauty an honor to receive your poem
incredible
not to be mean but this is when i was looking at my watch
the voice of the future a privilege to hear amandas words
before reacting to johns comment please check if you understand it correctly english can be sometimes tricky that way and please dont get into the band wagon just becos one person reacted negatively that too without really understanding of what what he is saying here i am pretty sure john is saying that she is a voice of our future our hope and it is our privilege that we are here to hear amandas words john i completely agree with you it is a privilege for us to hear her voice
@abu lahab bro why are you out here shilling for white supremacists im white and i know that decent white people arent a problem neonazis are
the voice of an activist that insists people like you are the cause of everything wrong oh youll get your future alright
@random person which country are you from
@random person is that a threat
@random person go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
you will not be alive to hear her again
what a brilliant young woman she is truly a shining example of the promise of americas youth
love her 3
you have made us so proud amanda 
yaaaassss chocolate princess a diamond
boommic drop
wow just wow so great to hear after the ramblings of the tangerine menace for the past 84 years was it
there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it if only we are brave enough to *be* it absolutely beautiful chills all over
white house circus  and the clowns running the show for the fools believe on their lies and deceptive manipulation
nice try but the republic is now dead
gag
amen  amen  amanda very beautify the future is yours to dream and conquer
great poem
she will be in the history books that poem is going to be a permanent part of american history 3
naw it probably wont we live in a fast food what have you done for me lately whats trending next generation this will probably be forgotten in 6 months im not criticizing but thats just the nature of things now a days
haha
lets build a statue of her that will be torn down by communists in true american fashion
hey can you post the last text on the subject of history longer than 1000 words youve read in the previous decade thanks because as somebody who actually does read history books no she will not be featured maybe a footnote on works centered on biden specifically definitely not in any general history textbook read in mandatory schooling the speech is pathetic compared to the great orators of history
and jamaican history  she represents vp other half/roots jamerican when you are half and half
yup 
beautiful speech 
it was a very passionate speech
ho pensato anchio la stessa cosa e credo che non rimarra permanentemente solo alla storia americana
and a permanent promise for american posterity [keeping in style]
yes i just preordered her book
definitely
amen
amanda gorman you said it impressive and moving
what a beautiful young lady who did not waste words however made me cry god bless you
bravo bravo bravo  masterfully crafted beautifully delivered brilliant on so many levels thank you amanda gorman bravo
lol they get african americans to speak at the inauguration to fool the world into believing that biden isnt racist oh the conversations him and his wife must have when no one is listening america are gonna get exactly what they voted for not long before theyll be crying wishing for president trump back bunch of double standard fools
watching from canada  welcome back usa 
thank you neighbor 
wow very timely and gracefully presented to the world
i hope ms gorman took that standing ovation to heart she will be receiving many of them i predict thank you thank you you are the light we need
my 2021 mantra 

touch the people souls  
it sounds like satan trying to sell you the new governement
brilliant beautiful wonderful loving powerful well done
puke dog barf
gorgeous
what an inspiring poem and what an impressive young woman thank you amanda for repping americas finest president biden can sure pick em thank you america for electing him
blm at its finest
bravo
some of the worst poets get paid the most
great work young lady let us listen and live by her words
wow
wow shes more articulate than trump
@walker stradley so $$ is your only value to a persons success youre the pathetic greed that is rotting america
and what an orator  brilliant
thats not difficult 
@walker stradley trump will be filing another bankruptcy very soon you can start a gofundme page for him
@walker stradley you mean the same man that filed for bankruptcy 6 times the same man who paid $750 in taxes the same man who scammed his supporters into paying off his campaign debt
yet what is ironic is trump could buy and sell you thousands of times over and not even bat an eyeso what other snide foolishness can you utter as you put your greeter vest on
a sack of potatoes is more articulate than trump show some respect to the potatoes
infinitely more articulate
the brash snowplow concomitantly appreciate because chill rationally interrupt midst a devilish anger smelly murky astronomy
pretty good maybe you can do the next one
second time listening to this so inspiring and applicable to any positive movement
that  that was good 
then all of the sudden titan eren ripped through the stage with a cloud of steam and a brilliant flash of light
wow
this poet is the future leadership
you mean dictatorship yep just like the nazi party hitler did background of all his soldiers so did bidentime hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizens privet lives so did bidentime hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city so did bidentime hitler placed fences around buildings so did biden hitler placed soldiers around said fences so did bidentime that didnt work out to well for hiler neither should it for bidentime we must never let a holocausts happen again just like the nazi party tried to do trump life
her delivery was mesmerizing and her words both piercing and uplifting
@k b 
@alwaysopen  me too
@lisa bbb here you are again smh 
@alwaysopen silly person you are stupid the feeling is real 
weak little mind i see
@lisa bbb youre a 300 lb diabetic

goodbye america china won this battle
you cant find a shot where her face isnt covered come on
shiiiiiiiiiiieeeet
simply beautiful 
incredible bravo thank you for your devine voice
not bad at all
well spoken
that was formidable
brilliant indeed captures biden and harris heart for the nation
@dreams never hated on her only biden and harris
@shotaro kaneda trump isnt any better but there is no reason to hate on this video just leave or cry we dont care
@the lowmein trump supporters dont want peace
@fabio editz shes an innocent young woman stop blindly hating everything like a moron
they have no heart period and china is bidens nation
im not even american and its clear as day that these people are corporate elites i dont understand how this schtick works everytime
you most mean china when you say nation
@sick86stang ikr
your delusional biden does not care about this country he is a fraud
indeed pretty words for equality and unity for all lets hope they come true and true for all not just some and not just some at the expense of others
cap they have no heart for the nation they have a heart for destruction
black women are pure power this was incredible
@miche yahla makes sense since the weak are always threatened by true moral and just power
they save democracy like literally and a black man save american political institutions the irony considering how this country have always traited them
i love her words but i hate that spoken poetic cadence she favors it doesnt flow organically and for me at least distracts from what she says
the volatile result aditionally decorate because pear directly live amid a illustrious headlight living enchanted receipt
beautiful
just brilliant 
incredible writing structure and message
seriously wheres hunter
powerful
amazing young leader 
this performance was beautiful beyond words way to go amanda gorman
she did a great job
powerful
wheres the trump supporters at  usually out in force maybe they are still upset about there beloved fuhrer not in power anymore d
shes a poet youd never know it
this poem is soul stirring as well as brilliantly delivered by amandag this scholar has greatness written all over her being it is about humanity bra ery and resilient she had to inspired by the god to penn those words which was as true as being prophetic
wow
ananda gormanamazing we will see her again and again she delivered perfectly with true grace and brilliancy a star shining bright even in the daytime hour manners and respect is due you set the tone for everything today blessings 
a pivotal moment in history most if not all the players institu and out of no werea giant is born amandayou rockand the world felt the aftershockrespect
poetry is not going to unite this country neither are joe biden or kamala harris get ready for things to get worse
we will hear it in rap tomorrow
a beautiful and fitting poem and a stunning job delivering it
was a nice speech for someone who doesnt realize joe biden would send her to jail or the plantations
wonderful
stunning and moving words
 there once was a man from nantucket who kept all his cash in a bucket then his son named hunter took all of it out put it in his crack pipe and sucked it 
in fifth grade we learned how limericks work something for you to look forward to
awesome awesome
the red thingwhy

youre obviously intimidated by her excellence 
and the communists crowd goes

be aware democrats demonstrated that now they know how to rig elections we need to keep pushing to get rid of those dominion machines used to select the washington corrupt swamp demand legal elections every day to your local officials
@ken havens with all respect i dont share your thoughts until a serious investigation of election fraud is conducted i will still believing in the presented evidence
@david fernandez sorry man the conspiracy theories are garbage and have been debunked trump lost fair and square he isnt man enough to admit itin any other context we would be laughing at him
@ken havens they didnt only few states voted for senate check the balance specially for those states where dominion machines were used
lol if the elections were rigged how did any other republicans downballot win 
oh we can comment on this poembut not the inauguration _
the awful spoon implicitly laugh because trumpet topologically pump since a fascinated territory cloistered afraid author
right there folks is the vaccination our country needed
yup now lets get back to killing babies
@encore baby i didnt say what the biden administration would do in office i said  what the biden presidency will bring not the same thing at all smh

this is our america  
moved me to tears i loved this and america should too
phenomenal young lady
god bless you she speaks for whole world
wtf is that big red circle on her head
it is a good poem but i dont think it will overshadow ts elliot oliver wendel holmes or keats im not sure a 22 year old has lived or experienced enough to be a poet laureate it read more like rap lyrics than traditional poetry

such beautiful poem the youth is our future not our past
look anyone is better to speak and get people onboard than two leaders who have a high probability for the gross offense of plagiarizing their speech less is more for these recent administrations 
run for the hills you silly girl before its too late for you dont americans have internet in usa type in creepy joe
this young woman is incredible her words are profound and warming faithful and optimistic her performance of those words was equally entralling she gives me hope for all of us fills my eyes with tears for the climb ahead and provides faith for me to believe in the coming generations artistry in short i am impressed thank you miss amanda gorman for rising up and participating

@coolhandlukeskywalkr lol imagine thinking you know more about poems than a national poet laureate 
@sara u rolling your eyes at me because you also dont know the difference between what is a speech and what actually constitutes poetry
@coolhandlukeskywalkr your words carry a weight few will be able to comprehend
@coolhandlukeskywalkr 
it was definitely not a poem it was a speech described to us erroneously as poetry how would you distinguish this as poetry no cadence no clever rhyming its just her out there pouring her heart out its a decent speech but i heard nothing that would make it a poem poem is supposed to be more like song lyrics or something something that actually makes it a poem if this is poetry then the word has lost all meaning
powerfulthis is americathe shining city on the hill
weve learned that quiet isnt always peace wow
actually quiet is peace unless someone is shouting in your face because you dont chant their ideology
@joshua destoville go cry somewhere else 
@denise ^ | | broken record for sale

@r im confused why you think denise is the troll
@denise 
trolls like kevin here trying to ruin the party just like the crazy uncle who we know who will overindulge in liquor and spew jealous hatred toward family members who are not offending him we know these people they are part of our american family they are seeking attention through provocation with underlying jealousy we have spent countless hours attempting to rehabilitate their their damaged souls and will continue to do so in the future but at this moment in history we must accept and ignore them knowing they will always exist and attempt to be obnoxiously relevant in our moments of unity and celebration so give that crazy uncle a few more shots find a nice warm bed to temporarily relieve his tormented soul then lock the bedroom door and party on
@mark haunert wasnt it such a beautiful moment the icing on the cake i believe she will stay on top of things 
@denise thx  im not usually a big emotional person but watching joe signing those executive orders was such a wonderful thing to see i worry about kamala and hope she doesnt get sloppy with her security 
@germangirl dont vote go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@denise  how can you enjoy yourself when you constantly fighting others in here telling them that you trying to have a good day looks like you disagree with many of them in here including mejust saying

youre right i agree that that is the most powerful line of the poem
davels farm yeah wow
@valentino luketic i personally do not vote but it was disgusting for me to look at when i seen video after video how he was smelling womens and childrens hair in front of the camera it was just disgusting and this is what people vote for i stopped voting many years ago but literally people were able to see what he was doing and they still voted for him  one girl even called out for her dad in front of the camera how can not only an american but any person support such a behavior if any school teacher would have done that to a child they would have been in jail by now
biden touching girls compilation
@arr i think youre confused about what im saying and who im saying it to
@ginny k not the brightest comment was it enjoy this special evening 
@denise they are upset and sad because they are miserable right now like a child being told the candy shop is closed i got told i was a old pervert because i said she was a very pretty woman and im older and white  have a wonderful and happy day 
@kevin johnson 5 deferment asthma joe never promised 2k but $1400 to add to the $600 already sent i believe
the palm beach   billionaires club were awfully quiet these past 4 years under trump
@ronald h you should hear him reading a quote with the n word to the senate biden says it with such ease and force you know he is familiar with the word
@kyril jordanov thats no true you have not listened to many poems from black americans or africans we have one story and it sounds alike in times of crisis
@foxy boop they will not take our joy because of their bitterness what a great day 
@ronald h i believe in the concept of black lives matters but not in the organisation read the mission statement and maybe youll understand it not an organization just to help blacks they mention aliens gays poor people etc even the civil rights act was supposed to be a catch up mechanism to help us catch with the people who enslaved us but it was watered down to the point it was for everybody white woman benefited more from the civil rights law than blacks
yeahthat part
@swerve dc dude white president no
@doug carpenter go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here what a great day 
@ginny k exactly and frump was infuriated because garth brooks didnt perform at his inauguration
@dreams wow how very puppet democrat you are the true racist sad sad day in america racist
@denise sound like youre crying to me blm antifa racist groups sad day in america sad
@john doe ok fair enough guess thats important to do at the moment to unite the nation and prevent further polarisation personally i didnt feel excluded by her words (im white by the way) but i dont live in the usa so i dont have to deal with the problems you are dealing with focus on minorities is hard to fully understand also for me i just settled with im no minority so i cant judge minoritys feelings it brought quite a bit of peace to my mind when dealing with racial discussions that anger me at first besides that those feelings really are the same ones that minorities already had to deal with for all of their lives
@lynnoue martino good causes are opinionated whats a good cause to you could not be to somebody else just bc you dont think the capital was a good cause yet during your good cause peaceful protests authority and officials were told to stand down while they was throwing molotov cocktails at the police and burning down and looting small businesses now all of the sudden they want everybody to unite
questo e un discorso che verra ricordato nei libri di storia come se non superiore a i have a dream assolutamente impossibile toglierlo dalle nostre menti fantastico
@john doe what does radical left have to do with this poem please dont embarrass yourself it doesnt look so good ooh a black woman saying things at bidens party she must be a left radical 
@richard famous the argument of yuppies and faux progressives and liars
@denise im living for your commentsno sense in feeding these trolls fresh responses 
@kevin johnson add $600 to $1400 get out your calculator if you need it spoiler alert its $2000
@kevin johnson he has not started yet so what lies but maybe ask mcconnell since the house has already pass the $2000 stimulus which did not get voted in the senate biden wants $2000 stimulus but its up to the house and the senate to vote for it maybe ask your house representative and your state senator if they will vote for it
@kevin johnson did trump give you 2000
@joegaud cry baby cry  aww lol awww    awwww 
@fuq utube but i am guessing that was a lie because i see people use that a lot republicans like to make people look stupid theyll say the n word and if someone calls them racist say how am i racist or im not racist clowns
@davels farm wow you havent heard many wow wow wow
thats not wow to mewhen you live it
@kevin johnson to quote your president will you just shut up man
@david turczak go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@swerve dc zero white singers what race are lady gaga and garth brooks
@xsinisterkidx or theyre just biden voters who thought the poem sucked
@denise libtard
wheres hunter wake up bill clinton
@xsinisterkidx there are public statements tweets interviews where he promised the full 2k tell that to starving/bankrupt/evicted families im sure theyre gonna love the subtle political huckster distinction
@tonika taylor you are so right 
@kevin johnson $1400 $600 = $2000 so what are you going on about
@denise i concur she was super wonderful whats understood doesnt need to be explained debated or argued let them have their moment alone with no response
@xsinisterkidx and even before he was sworn in he already did a disgusting thing in lowering them to $1400
@kevin johnson what are you talking about biden lying about $2000 checks the man has been president for 3 hours lol
@xsinisterkidx they are so miserable arent they they cant take away the beauty and joy she brought us though 
amazing that this poem is so poignant witty and beautiful and cult 45 decides to show up in the comment section and spread their hate
@rubyruth whats powerful about it 
@cckid81 to you were enjoying this beautiful poetry over here 
wow  why wow  the phrase wasnt that original or artful
@michelle abbott she was wonderful 
that part definitely caught my attention too she did such an amazing job
@you tube hmmm i dont hear 1 repression 2 single party 3state ownership perhaps everyone should educate themselves about definitions prior to using words and attributing personal beliefs to those words without doing the heavy lifting of educating oneself first
@kevin johnson go cry somewhere else were all here enjoying this beautiful poetry 
@denise so pardon me if this empty symbolism poetry and president dont ring true for many
@denise im not miserable but the millions of families who were counting on $2000 to pay bills and feed their kids sure are turns out they may get only $1400 if that biden is not a superstar hes a civil servant hes here to serve the people he serves us not the other way around
soy
@kevin johnson we are all enjoying ourselves and this beautiful poetry what a great day 
@denise and to anticipate the obvious retort  im a committed leftist and loathe trump
@lisa bbb go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@kevin johnson you can be miserable were enjoying ourselves over here though
@denise i will not be a biden sycophant or a bad poetry sycophant
@denise no i wont ill decry bad poetry if i want all i want )
@denise  this girl is boring zzzzzzz
@swerve dc would you say odonovan is a traditional black surname or do you just enjoy making stuff up
@vittorio marano go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@kevin johnson go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@swerve dc did the blacks grab lady gaga in this years draft or do you just enjoy making stuff up
@denise really with that piece of dead man
quiet may mean dead people finns have found that out the hard way a couple of times
@kyril jordanov no plagerism here those are words of a struggle that many of our people share these are not new words but this poem is her individual thoughts and shaping of how she sees the world what she wants to see going forward many great minds think alike
wow thats powerful 
the admin purposely chose and used african americans to gain points which makes me want to vomit zero white speakers or singers and dont get me wrong all were great but i dont trust this admin any more than the others its all about how they are perceived and they count on us not noticing that they used all ams for their benefit
@you tube anything that brings equality into view and draws attention into civil rights is deemed communist by racist bigots the only america you would be happy with is a white america
agreed 
@john doe protesting for good causes like police brutalityracism
@denise is dissent tolerated any more can people talk about poetry without sycophancy have we already all forgotten biden lied about giving $2000 cheques
@fuq utube wow how very republican of you (
@dee shan i have to disagree so corny this sort of trite pun belongs with french structuralism not the vibrant language of whitman
reminds of the rage against machine lyric silence can be violence
@davels farm you havent heard much poetry have you she plagiarized much of this from speeches of the obamas
@denise https//youtube/tgpxjj7pskq
deep man deep
@you tube sigh theres always one
@ronald h go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here
@denise blm is still waiting for a response from the biden admin for a seat at the table on civil rights they sent him a letter and were given the finger you got played
the world is watching and this magnificent lady is what theyre seeing and listening to so proud 
@fuq utube go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
and the norms and notions of just what is isnt always justice  so good
@you tube sour grapes 
wow wow extremely powerful poem the very best i have heard in my life time wow #2021
beautiful words do matter
amanda gorman  you have brought such light into this time of shade i am deeply grateful and inspired by your beautiful inspiring words thank you for shining your light and painting a picture of our bright future for us all
 from panafrika from the world to be it
isnt this a brilliant powerful poem and poet
this young human inherently touched me to the point of crying it was the 1st time in the past year i had a little hope for our youth this country humanity if her words dont move yr soul there is no hope for expanding or changing the way you think editlay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another this phrase should be made into a motto for the next generation
watching from europe this is the highlight from this inauguration goosebumps all over me well done amanda gorman

if this doesnt give you hope  nothing will thank you amanda gorman my soul is full
hello there i find it really odd replying to your comments here because i dont usually chat with fans but i want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here  i realized how much you like and follow my channel thank you
people who click dislike on this should be ashamed of themselves
from now on ill just recite my grocery list its bread beer and buttwipes and if you dont like my poem you should be ashamed of yourself
@(s)riley dunn the first black author was published less than 250 years ago sub saharans have not been literate for very long in the united states phillis wheatley was educated and went on to be the first verified and confirmed black author in history im hebrew we have had books for thousands of years we wrote poems thousands of years before any sub saharans could learn to read thats not controversial phillis wheatley was an unusual case taught to read long before other sub saharans were the majority of african americans were preliterate until well into the 18th century thats when evangelicals decided to convert them thats when we taught them to read english english is their first written language they spoke rudimentary languages such as yoruba the reason their languages are rudimentary is precisely because they didnt have any alphabet all poc trace back to preliterate tribesmen unless were talking about the east asians nothing controversial or racist about acknowledging roots
@(s)riley dunn  just read a bit of this genius poem aloud  we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one um that is absolutely not a poem its typical runofthemill selfaggrandizing jargon exactly what you would expect to hear in a political speech
@(s)riley dunn lol poc were preliterate until the 18th century so were supposed to change the textbook definition of a poem and conflate poetry with speech because most poc cant tell the difference and wouldnt care if they could i dont think so tupac is more of a poet than this girl maybe she has other writing that could be considered poetry but what she got up and read today was clearly a speech not poetry words have meaning we shouldnt dumb everything down to accommodate poc is that what they want and expect  they want us to lower the standards until they begin to reach them how about the idea that words have meaning that we all already agreed upon dont shoot the messenger
@dcderrick41 i find it utterly despicable youd call me racist i judged her poem and thats the conclusion you reach why is any dissent tolerated nowdays i say that as a proud leftist
@kevin johnson i think you probably would have liked it my friend if you listened to her words and not hear it with racist ears  
@cailin eireann i didnt say a poem absolutely has to rhyme it would have been too difficult for her to make it rhyme shes obviously not got the verbal lq or wit of cole porter but a poem should have cadence and meter i didnt hear anything that would distinguish this as poetry as opposed to just a nice speech is it a speech or is it poetry its not a poem its clearly just a speech 
@k t the only fraud of late left the house this morning
@coolhandlukeskywalkr poems dont need words that rhyme
that was not a good poem no need to attack people of good faith who disliked it
@xdarkxarenx its not an opinion because it lacks intellectual discussion and critical thinking
@k t lol triggered
people who condone this multinational election fraud should be ashamed
we are not
@kin cryptocurrency bitcoin others what land in the world was built upon with no lives lost and unstolen land
@xdarkxarenx no not for having an opinion for having *that* opinion you see some opinions are good some are bad not all equal
@xdarkxarenx come on my friend  i know you loved the cruel idiot but dont be a sore loser like him my friend  you were born in america i hope and you are better than that
i dont dislike it but im confused as to why people are accepting this as poetry it was a speech it was definitely not poetry there was no poem recited maybe they are giving thumbs down because a speech is erroneously described as poetry
what a fragile you are
oh hey we both came to rewatch this powerful beautiful poem at the same time ) amanda gormon stole the show with a message that entire nation needed to hear

@lovely sumish lovely sumish ignoreonlylove over here lovely sumish
@denise facts

@lovely sumish lovely sumish  this girl was boring zzzzzzz

woman
@c m sounds like you had a rough childhood yikes
martin luther personified
@c m you should delete it lol
@denise i apologize i was referring to the post underneath it
@c m and you are
@c m dont judge my smartness out of just one sentence and i believe there is something called everyone to their own opinions u dont like her ur problem i aint gonna call a duffer for that so please refrain urself from judging what i am or what i am not just to spite me up
@c m go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
you are not smart either
a stunning speech and performance such insightgrace and wisdom from one so young is rare indeed gave me extended goosebumps what a wonderous and inspiring young lady marvelous the sun shone with her today ( 
@coolhandlukeskywalkr no she is a true poet you just refuse to accept it
@coolhandlukeskywalkr youre so mad at this womans talent youve commented this under every post doesnt take away how amazing she is
yes it was a speech however it was not poetry she was supposed to read a poem instead she gave a speech a for effort but obviously shes not a poet she writes speeches not poetry
wow
how beautiful from a beautiful young woman
agreed she so pretty i actually had a hard time listening to her 
everyone speak shout a word because you deserve to be heard dont be afraid of the fear that is thrust upon you cause youre better than most of all you think is inside you more power to you
much too long for a guest speaker she basically repeated president bidens talking points using every word in the dictionary i give it three stars ***oo
@they dont know oh selfburn those are rare
@princeoftidds lonely is giving yourself a thumbs up
you must be so lonely
this is my younger sister walai

@study buddy you might be a victim of deception and propaganda
ethan mariani the start of becoming the united states of america once again indivisible with liberty and justice for all
the opening ceremony for civil war
amazing
next jim cramer delivers his poem they are nuts they are nuts they know nothing
lol this poem was sooo great they had to censor the comments section
this was the best speech ive ever heard its literally amazing
@nudgarrobot respectfully disagree mr bot it used neither meter nor structure it was prose ie spoken word open mic fodder at best periodt good luck with your complaining posttrump
@mr meerkat prose written or spoken language in its ordinary form without metrical structure literal dictionary definition youre incorrect this uses meter its poetry period
@nudgarrobot this is prose which is spoken word technically not poetry
@coolhandlukeskywalkr this is very much poetry poetry isnt based on rhyme its based on meter and structure this is super well structured well composed and emotional
fake cheating dems its sickening fake propaganda hairy legs remember
@coolhandlukeskywalkr this was poetry listen againor do you still think poetry needs to rhyme
@jthomas420 no to brainwashing smoothtalkers
@coolhandlukeskywalkr who cares man just enjoy the words
thanks for admitting it was a speech and it was not poetry it was erroneously sold to us as poetry but there was no poem this is just a speech not a poem
i cant imagine giving a speech after this amazing articulate lady
@trasktalker yeah but thats just 1 story from his wonderful life you want to get into epstein or maybe the beauty pageants we could go on and on
@mark haunert atleast he was paying a full grown adult to do what she did for a living unlike joe biden who can only stand at attention for children 
@trasktalker oh thats ironic as hell trump is such a wonderful little angel isnt he according to stormy daniels he is a  little  something 
@zerosum23 doesnt take rocket science to figure out why its upsetting for some women flat out jealousy
@mark haunert or im just trying to point out why this little compliment might not be hitting some people quite right i tried to phrase it in the nicest least antagonistic way i could but i guess reading comprehension isnt for everyone
@zerosum23 her passion
@dreams people with a dark and iron hand
@justin smith it is a great day
@zerosum23 seems like a lot of people are having trouble with giving a young lady a little compliment sad isnt it
@lisa bbb i dont think ill take advice on how to perform poetry from someone who doesnt even know which form of too is correct
she is to flowery to much hand movements i was glad she was finish n get off stage
what a great day for china and the ccp
@rafigish sadly there are always haters racists etc but she is a triumph who rises above them
@dreams yeah im pretty sure its a particular  group  very sad not to find joy in this beautiful human being 
@denise https//youtube/tgpxjj7pskq
@denise so sad not being able to find joy in this young intelligent and stunning woman 
@virtual reality go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@rafigish i already know what kinds of people downvoted it (or disliked it just in case someone wants to get technical)
@rafigishi didnt even notice that until you said that must be a jealousy thing shes absolutely adorable
i cant imagine that this is currently downvoted by 10% of viewers
shes beautiful 
extraordinary
nothing is lost to youth riveted by her genius
@mark mywords are you seriously trying to draw a false equivalency between this woman and someone who died 50 years before she was born
@ginny k you mean unlike disney
@mark mywords you wouldnt know communism if it hit ya in the head
@mark mywords interesting you equate the arts with communism
@margaret werncke communistic indoctrination is great

@mark mywords everyone is indoctrinated in some form or anotherglad its this instead of something else
everything is lost to the indoctrinated youth
powerful poetry that meets this moments
fake cheating dems its sickening fake propaganda hairy legs remember
@coolhandlukeskywalkr poetry doesnt have to rhyme
@coolhandlukeskywalkr it was not a nursery rhyme or a speech if thats all you have to say about the powerful poetry that spoke to our country and the world wellwhen someone shows you who they are believe them the first timei see you
@coolhandlukeskywalkr i agree its a great speech and a great piece of prose but its not poetry
@coolhandlukeskywalkr says who i believe the library of congress would disagree maybe you should reconsider your definition of poetry 
powerful crap
it was a speech in no way is that poetry no cadence nothing rhymes to describe this as poetry now were describing every speech as poetry theres nothing to distinguish this as poetry it was a speech
she definitely isnt speaking for antifa and blm
@black queen how can black lives matter unless all lives matter obviously in your heart you are a racist
@black queen but they attack whites and black that say all lives matter
@black queen if youre against racism you should be against racism of any kind of race
brilliant thank you (from the world ) we so needed this
@k b 
speak for yourself
@valpanig go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
we dont need fairy tales and fine speeches  less intervention from federal government and real protection of economy from outsourcing production overseas
no we didnt youre wrong
thanks 
@randy what bro
@randy shut up trumpie
what is this creature
@kubush thanks sweety 
@robert k seek help for your hormonal imbalances
we warned you not to go out by the daylight as you could see now it is disturbing for you to see a human do a favour to your self and crawl back into your cave 
dont be disrespectful
   
she is cute ebony
this is one of the most moving poems i have ever heard amazing deep important and speaking to the soul thank you
@stephen saunders i didnt think it was a great poem parts of it were good parts of it werent i preferred her super bowl poem
@coolhandlukeskywalkr your post is poetry it speaks to your state of mind indirectly indicating you have little imagination expand your mind poetry doesnt need to fit into your box to be poetry
@coolhandlukeskywalkr revolting but ill at least give you this you arent pretending to be inclusive like so many of your belief system do feigning outrage that someone _innocent_ like them could be so hatefully accused of racism you just came out and said it its refreshing so youve got that going for ya its not much but its something
@deb roberts i said it was a good speech words have meaning you dont care if the words speech and poem are conflated but i care she wrote a good speech its not at all the same thing as writing a good poem good poems are definitely harder to write than good speeches it takes more talent to do what phillis wheatley did than to do what she did thats a fact
@dreams lol yes it was a good speech for a poc since they were preliterate until we taught them english halfway through the 18th century i think its important not to compare her to someone like ira gershwin shes held to a lower standard because sub saharans didnt publish a book until the 18th century while weve been authoring text for 3000 years if we held her to the standards of irving berlin then that would be considered racist im saying shes a good writer for poc they dont typically make great writers there are no great novels not even a great film script ashkenazi are typically great writers sub saharans typically speak and write using ebonics as soon as one comes along who can write an eloquent speech that is already something fringe and not mainstream its already out of the ordinary im not saying that we are better than them just that there is an lq gap and that weve been authoring text for thousands of years before the first black authors existed
@coolhandlukeskywalkr who cares whether its poetry or speech   there was music and truth in the message too bad you missed it wish you could see and hear the gorgeousness of amanda gormans exquisite exhortation youd be moved fired up hopeful optimistic and connected its ok not to get it not everyone can were all wired differently
@coolhandlukeskywalkr you are a trump supporter in a nutshell constantly spewing nothing but ignorance and hate you people just need to come out as racist already it was a good speech for a poc  coolhandlukeskywalkr 2021
@coolhandlukeskywalkr uh do you know what poetry is
@randy thats the best a trump supporter can come up with right there well done
@coolhandlukeskywalkr you commenting that under every post wont change anything go cry somewhere else were enjoying ourselves over here 
@denise   i didnt say it was a bad speech it was a good speech for a poc her age though shes obviously not got the verbal lq or wit of a cole porter however a poem should have cadence and meter i didnt hear anything that would distinguish this as poetry as opposed to just a nice speech is it a speech or is it poetry its not a poem its clearly just a speech dont shoot the messenger
@coolhandlukeskywalkr regardlessit is still powerfulthe meaning of it and how it is truly needed
@coolhandlukeskywalkr it was amazing you commenting this under ever post like it will change that lol
theres no way this is poetry it was a speech described to us erroneously as poetry its not a poem
