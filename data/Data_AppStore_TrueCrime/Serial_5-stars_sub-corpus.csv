1,CharF28,20230308T011412,5,Great Episode,"I think this is a great episode of Serial. I love how they always go in-depth into what they are talking about and how so much information also has people in the story so you don't get bored of the same person. Usually, I like to listen to podcasts on youtube so I can watch them talk but this podcast just keeps drawing me back in and always keeps me thinking so I don't need to see the actual people speaking. I really think people should watch this. It goes in-depth and you also learn the backstory and the now. You also get to learn things that we can do to better the justice system in America and you learn things that relate to your episode.","I think this is a great episode of Serial.

Like the Duke Lacrosse case, one office is blinded by one direction and some use it as a tool to try to be elected to an office. These prosecutors not being held accountable is just as bad!

Your work shows brilliantly and honestly both how important investigative journalism remains to the functioning of democracy and how impotent it has become in the face of deeply embedded racism and corruption. I particularly loved how transparently you dealt with the issue of ""objectivity"" — a loaded and culturally relative term which should have been interrogated and abandoned in the US journalistic sphere long ago. Brian's pique at the apparent violation of objectivity on the part of Hamza was profoundly revealing. I'm so glad you included that in the series. I also loved how there is no gotcha at the end.

I really enjoyed listening to TIA ... like way way more than I was expecting to. I mean, it's focus is a small PAC, in a moderately small county in North Carolina. And while the drama does touch on national political events, most of the meat of the story is found in its present of local political fights and drama. Given that intensely local focus, and how distant that local scene is from my own experience (I live in a small rural MN county), I was surprised at how drawn I was to continue listening to this season.

520,JulliG,20200928T003119,5,Seasons 1-3 Were Great,"I really love Sarah Koenig and the first several seasons. It was a bad choice to add the Nice White Parents podcast to the lineup. I found the information to be interesting but I didn't find it to be fairly assessed. For example, it seems to demonize the parents who wrote in support of integration but didn't send their kids to that school. There was no justification of the school not opening for 5 years after the letters were written or that these parents all seemed to be interested in giving their child the best education available while wanting to support integration. The last episode also talked a great deal about how nothing changes unless white parents raise the issue. While that may be true it may also be said that nothing changes unless the majority of people are concerned. As a white person I have no problem with bringing to light the dramatic injustices that have happened as a result of racial inequality. I just don't think this story was told fairly or without bias as I have come to expect from Serial. Still giving 5 stars though because the actual podcast is excellent and I support the risk that was taken to promote this series here.","I really love Sarah Koenig & the first several seasons.

The comments show people will run back to the same arguments over and over again, which is why this country is still where it is. The podcast is older so the term systemic racism isn't as popular yet. The message is clear. Children do not have equal opportunity. Parents that have time to petition or have their staff petition for their children, are not the norm. Children that misbehave one year should not suffer for the rest of their school career. The author is right, you can't measure nice! And you can't punish kids because both parents have to work or they can't afford a French tutor and so on. I would listen, with an open mind. Is it going to attack you personally? Yes. You'll be ok though. This author isn't solving anything but telling a story and an outcome, which we all can take lessons from.

I do have a comment though about the fact that this is a international studies school however there was not much of that even though there is a high percentage of Hispanic students and about a 10% of Arabic students. Well now with the new parents and their ideas and interest things have shifted in the direction they need. And she mentions how now the French program is valuable because the new parents care for it and Spanish or Arabic is not and was not even in the curriculum.

The black defendants are not being portrayed as perfect citizens in the podcast so I don't view this as white vs black. It's raising much needed awareness to social injustice.

I've encountered so many people who were obviously not guilty but felt they had to plead guilty because of stacked charges. In Virginia, the prosecutor's offices are ""paid"" by the state for every conviction they get, hence they don't dismiss charges but bargain on the sentence. Who is willing to risk 80 years when they can plead guilty and get 3-6 months and two years probation. It's an incredibly corrupt way to do justice and it's a conflict of interest to boot. Thank you for your very insightful analysis. You get it and reported fairly.","I’m a former probation officer and have been incredibly frustrated with how unfair the system is for anyone accused of a crime.

It took a year to make and the diligence with which it was researched shows through in every episode. The reporters present all sides with fairness and humanity. It has no political agenda. It offers no easy solutions. But it does shine a light on a broken system in which the concept of justice is too often forgotten.,This podcast revives the craft of great investigative journalism.

I was afraid that her matter-of-factly type approach would get very boring. I'm really glad I stuck it out. I listened to all 3 seasons objectively and put together my review carefully. This podcast is not like the others, Sarah Koenig has a very thorough methodology when she interviews all persons - whether behind bars or high power judicial figures. She is highly intelligent which is conveyed with her eloquence and I believe she offers the listeners a non bias approach. In season 1, she is very back and forth with her opinion on Adnan as more evidence becomes available. She's not afraid to submerge herself into the case in order to provide as many facts as she can. I really appreciated this podcast and hope to hear of a season 4 soon.","Initially upon listening to a few episodes after binging on a number of true crime podcasts, I may have judged prematurely.

This is important, personally to me, but also historically. Listen, try to understand. It’s painful, usually unsatisfying, often inconclusive, and mostly contradictory, but that’s life. Oddly beautiful and yet hard to stomach. Thank you to the creators for shining a light where few are willing to even glance."

911,brekac19,20191116T124117,5,A Great Season,"As a resent law school graduate nothing covered in season 3 shocked me. Rather it confirmed what I already know about our justice system. What it did do was humanize the injustice and those facing it. I have worked as a public defender, and whenever I discuss these injustices with people they always say who cares, these people broke the law and they deserve this. This season, in my opinion did a great job of combating that. This season took that ""criminal"" who does not deserve justice and gives them a name, a voice, and a platform to share their story. This season has humanized them and exposed the ways the system has failed them. I truly hope that it has allowed people making these they deserve it claims see that no one deserves the things that happen and that justice in America is not necessarily justice at all.","As a resent law school graduate nothing covered in season 3 shocked me.

The journalists herself is a great narrator and makes it so interesting and easy to follow. For people saying she is being bias and not holding the ""criminals"" accountable must live in a bubble. I say this because many reviews put their two cents about law and racial discrimination, how they suggest maybe just moving neighbors instead of repeating crimes and dealing with the abuse. LET ME TELL YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ""growing up in south central los angeles"" (to most known for having a high percentage of mostly African Americans, gang bangers, drug addicts and really high crime rates to say the east) Anyways, plain and simple IS NOT EASY TO JUST PICK UP AND LEAVE. Most people living in these areas dont have the money, help, or opportunities to do so. This is one of the reason that law enforcement takes advantage. The statistics show that once a person is input into the criminal system is so much easier for them to fall back in for longer terms each time. The streets, system and lack of opportunities for many people living in these areas is like a game and only a few ""win""( in other words get out if the hood). Many people that listen to these podcast are not aware of this simply because they were a lot more fortunate and had better opportunities. Trust me is easy to judge when you have not lived or experienced many of the things that this podcast brings up. I really enjoyed listening to it.","Ok, I started listening not knowing what i was going to get out of it or not. Let me say i got hooked right after the first episode.

I realize the justice system is more the focus than the city, but the reactionary ideologies shown by law enforcement, judges, attorneys,etc. are run amok even where I live. This is the justice most people I've met envision. Cleveland is city of degenerate, white flight influenced populism. It's a problem I think the city can only age it's way out of.

1045,lilhippyrealtrippy,20190731T180247,5,Insightful Gripping Poscast,"Serial is a great podcast that gives you an in-depth analysis of each case season 1-3. Season 2 was my least favorite. Initially I was thrown off by season 3's structure as some other reviewers were. However I gave it a try. It's extremely insightful, giving us an upfront dive into our judicial system and it's flawed construct. People should look at it objectively. Some things I agree with, some things I don't but I think the reporting is objective not pandering. It seems pandering for people who don't want to see the reality that sometimes the judicial system fails to administer justice fairly without bias no matter the race or if a person has a badge. Saying she's siding with ""the streets"" is so condescending and teetering on prejudice. Not everyone prosecuted from ""the streets"" is guilty and that's the point she's trying to make. Just because a court gives a sentence doesn't make it outright impartial justice even though it should be. There's some defendants on here that sound arrogant and the same can be said for the cops and prosecutors interviewed as well. The justice system should be equal parts punishment and rehabilitation. Currently rehabilitation, in my opinion, isn't as much an option for courts as condemnation and punishment. What she's doing is showing the humanity in demographics where people assume have none just because of their race or where they come from. Give the stories a chance and have an open mind. It won't hurt to try because obviously what we've been doing for decades hasn't healed the nation or benefited everyone fairly. Change is the only option left.","Serial is a great podcast that gives you an in-depth analysis of each case season 1-3. Season 2 was my least favorite.

Criminal justice needs a drugs overhaul. The system seems set up to keep those in it once they are in it. The youthful offenders in particular seemed to not stand a chance. Piling suspended license upon suspended license so these kids can't ever pay the fine only perpetuates the problem. This was a much needed light on a problem many of us don't know about or thin about bc we are not involved.

It is actually 100% inconsequential whether or not he did or didn't do it. The point is to show that some way, some how, this guy was sentenced to life with such an absurdly small amount of evidence that it ought to make you afraid to even have friends. The justice system is in need of serious reform, and the fact that you can be charged with murder with no DNA evidence linking you to the crime, based on nothing but circumstantial evidence and how likable the witnesses presented might be is a disgusting betrayal of justice, REGARDLESS of whether this man did it or not. Even if he did do it, it is still a disgusting betrayal of justice that he was able to be sentenced with so little pointing to him. This podcast did a great job showing that. And to people who were annoyed with the same small details being brought up each episode, you clearly missed how these things relate to the bigger picture that I mentioned as they are brought up again in light of new reference points that make them questionable at best, and continue to show how unbelievable it is that these pieces of ""evidence"" (if you can even call them that with a straight face) were used to sentence this man, guilty or not.

As a white male who has actually experienced the criminal justice system first hand, I often have conversations with other white men and women who seem to have no real understanding of how lucky we are... I am not a felon. Not because I haven't been charged with felonies, but only because I was able to pay my way out of them. I have always been given the benefit of the doubt anytime I have been in front of a judge, encountered the police, or talked to a prosecutor. The majority of people in prison have not been afforded these same opportunities to use the system to their advantage, and the majority of those people are men of color. Thank you for this season. There is real truth here, and more people in a position to do something about it need to hear that truth.","I cannot express how much this most recent season of serial moved me.

It had to do with public defense and whether or not it was important. My previous representative that the court had given me during the case contacted me asking if I'd talk to them. He'd basically saved me from jail time or dui program at the least. While dealing with multiple diagnoses including blood cancer the city took me to court with no drugs on my person, in my car or in my blood and no alcohol. I'd passed out because I couldn't breathe after dialysis and they attempted to establish a dui case first and thing and continued including the officer showing up at court and trying to speak to me as if he weren't the entire reason the district attorney was still holding onto my case. In the end even with a lawyer stepping up (after seeing he could certify everything I explained and I could provide 90% of my own case from my folder I keep for all insurance and proofs needed for intensive care) they still wanted to keep after me. I've seen the system in my area work on most of the lower levels spoken of in the show. So needless to say I can relate to this production. It makes me sad to know the feeling to which you speak. I've spent my fair share of time sitting in magistrate offices and criminal court to see the way things are in our country (or at least on my states level). I've thought about it all and you fairly nailed it dead on in the end. Too bad they won't listen.","I’ve had my own experiences dealing with the system since childhood and into adulthood.

Finally someone exposes the nonsense people go through at courthouses every single day. With no fancy lawyer to spend countless hours and money to advocate for you. While a prosecutor seems to be prosecuting you because they can with no consideration to wether they should. It is all so unfair and if you dont have money the scales are heavily weighed against you from the moment you step in there. Everyone is so caught up in cases like steve avery and how unjust his case seemed. What about the kid who cooperated with the prosecution, gave them multiple convictions and was rewarded with 9 years in the same prison as the people he helped put away? What about the lady who was charged with assaulting a police officer because she made contact with him while being assaulted by several people? Things like that happen to thousands of people a day and they walk in to court with a public defender who has 5 other cases that day and maybe they care or maybe they are just punching the clock.

1685,Noyster2,20181020T144605,5,Season 3 Is Spellbinding,"I commend Ms. Koenig and her team on this deep dive into the American justice system. In season three Koenig offers up literate sketches of individuals on both sides of the legal system alongside historical perspective on how money, the scarcity of time and politics shaped the law and sentencing. We come away with a sense of the legal system as a great, creaky machine inexorably threshing through lives. The many moving parts of the machine, alternately likable, heroic, hapless, brutal or sly, are forced into shapes that fit the clockwork. I've read though a number of reviews posted here and I see that there are some angry suggestions that Koenig's team has a ""liberal"" bias (usually followed with indignant threats that the listener intends to unsubscribe.) How different is Season Three from the preceding two that it merits this new partisan response? Rather than focusing on one person's journey through the twists and turns of a convoluted system it is that system itself in the spotlight. All three seasons feature 'good' and 'bad' cops but here we run into the ""Blue wall"" as an institution. Each courtroom seems an individual fiefdom subject to the judges' personal style which ranges from beneficial practicality to unsettling paternalistic entitlement. And the lawyers are institutionally forced into the role of a cattle dealer: throwing in a few good heifers to sweeten the deal. This U.S. Constitution's uplifting central guarantee to every American's right to a ""day in court"" is sullied by the gritty transactional process.","I commend Ms. Koenig and her team on this deep dive into the American justice system.

1778,Janebiss12,20181007T001557,5,Cluelessly Insensitive,"There is some fantastic reporting here. Full stop. But my question is: who is your audience for this podcast? Because you often sound like you're talking to white people who will be similarly shocked (although shock coming from you sounds more like bemusement). What if you presumed that a part of your audience knows about the kind of incidents you describe, or —gasp— has direct experience with a deeply unjust justice system? How would that impact your storytelling? Your ""we"" simply does not include people of color. I hesitate to give this feedback lest it fuel the ""white people can't tell black stories,"" narrative which I really don't believe. But i do think that you can come across as a very dangerous kind of entitled person. You seem to think that because you can identify the nuances of prejudice, that your translation/delivery can't be racially insensitive. Your light and bouncy tone, jokey treatment and sometimes overwritten descriptions of racists, racist incidents and racist institutions only dilute the horror, make it easier for people to tolerate. Either give us facts only, or stop making lovable characters out of despicable humans. I stopped counting how many times you laughed or made jokes in inappropriate places. These are people's lives you're reporting about. You sound like someone who literally has nothing to lose. Throwing in a black Brit for 5 minutes a podcast is not the solution (yes, I'm sure you all anticipated that kind of blowback). STOP BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM. You may be aware of your privilege, but you haven't figured out how to keep it from bleeding into every part of the stories you tell.

At 10am one morning the police came to my house to serve me on a dog off leash charge (which I'll also note they had no evidence for and I had to go to court for 3 months and miss work only to have it finally dismissed). My boyfriend who was on probation answered the door. The police asked for his ID, went to the car and once they saw he was on probation they said they smelled alcohol and handcuffed him for violating probation. He was on his way to work... The police in this country use the illusion of protecting the citizens to stroke their egos and cause fights. Where does this position of law enforcer come from anyways? Why do the people who are supposed to be protecting us carry guns and weapons? Why do they set such a poor example of what it means to be a peaceful and good citizen?

1992,YoMaloney,20180627T184853,5,Neesha Call,"This is a spoiler, stop reading if you haven't listened yet. I can't find anywhere else to ask this question. It's been a few years since I listened to this and I am relistening to it now. I'm in episode 8 so maybe this gets covered later but Sarah says she gets hung up on the neesha call, that it's really bad for adnan but I don't think it's quite as bad. So neesha says she had no answering machine so the phone was definitely picked up. It's not ever mentioned if they asked her what her regular schedule was at that time, did she have after school activities? Would she have even been home at 320? Did she have any younger siblings? I think it's entirely possible that someone else picked up, if it was a younger sibling who doesn't really know what to do with a phone they could have just held it there while someone talked on the other end and it could have been a butt dial so maybe they weren't talking directly to who picked up and if it's a kid I could see them just holding it a while or even if it was intentional- neesha was the first on his speed dial, teenagers hanging out smoking pot do tend to make random calls and say random stuff no matter who answers. Or the kid could have gone to get the parent since they don't really know what to do with phone calls and by the time the parent came to the phone, jay or whoever was on the end of adnan's phone hung up. The thing that really makes me think this isn't a smoking gun is that neesha mentions then being at a video store calling her, she doesn't mention if they only called her once or if it was a regular occurrence but she's specific on them being at the video store and the ways it's talked about seems like a single occurrence. At trial when neesha mentions the video store they jump in and ask her to skip past that and just say what they talked about. Jay didn't start working at the video store until after hae's death. It's not clear if neesha ever says she's not sure what day they call her, but it seems like they say it matter of factly to her- tell us about this call, this call that came on that day, and maybe she just told them about the call and assumed they were correct on the day. They talked to her over a month after it happened, in the in the dark podcast they talk to a lot of witnesses who testified they saw the person on a specific day but when asked later say oh I saw them all the time I have no idea if it was that day, or oh I saw them sometime that month or that summer but I have no idea when. That's a large margin of error. I think the neesha call that neesha testifies about happens after hae's death bc she's very specific about them being at the video store and her story doesn't change. Did the defense/could the defense get the phone records? I know they got them for that day but could they get them for the whole month/the month after, if there is another call to neesha then it can't be said with certainty that the neesha call happened the day that hae died.","This is a spoiler, stop reading if you haven’t listened yet.

I was on a 7 hour road trip, miami to tallahassee, and i arrived at my home after 7 long hours only to wait in my car for 15 minutes to finish the series. So good. I wouldn't listen to the second season, if i was serial i would untarnish the perfection of season 1 by renaming the second season ""Bout bo"" and making it a whole different podcast.

Would I remember? It also shows the darker side of the criminal justice system with deceptive lawyers and shady police work. Listen to this. I promise you'll love it.
2375,Bravesrule22,20170522T131640,5,Best. Podcast. Ever.,"This podcast was so riveting and entertaining that I could not stop listening. The investigation is very well thought out and very detailed so it is easy to follow and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It exposes the injustices that were predominant in the trial of Adnan Syed, the Muslim male accused of murdering Hae Min Lee. Sarah Koenig brings up many points in her argument including inconsistencies in the accusers story, inconceivable timelines, and investigation bias. I would recommend this podcast to those that are fascinated by criminal investigations but would advise to anyone listening that it is emotional at times because of the deep content.","This podcast was so riveting and entertaining that I could not stop listening.

It causes you to continually change your opinion on who the guilty person is while making you to reflect on our country's court systems and the possibility of wrongful convictions. The whole podcast follows the logical and mostly impartial guidance of Sarah Koenig who conducts countless interviews with friends and family of Syed, phone calls with Adnan in the Maryland Correctional Facility, and a reinaction of the day of the murder. Koenig guides you through her own personal struggle of who actually murdered Hay Min Lee while gaining assistance from investigative teams who are trying to turn over more evidence.

Most people see convictions and assume the authorities got it right, and this just goes to show that sometimes you have to ask questions- lots of questions- in the name of justice. Sarah is a delight to listen to, not all podcasters of journalists are easy to listen to. She is effortless in her speaking and it sounds natural, like I'm talking on the phone to a friend. Seems silly... but it makes for more enjoyable listening! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.","Absolutely outstanding! The mixing, the score, the delivery and most importantly the STORY.

Every episode lead to a different viewpoint or a new fact that could turn the case. As the story unwinds, new interviews, information, and questions arise that lead you to question every person put under the microscope. Stories told by people 20 years later help to shape the story and what could have actually happened with Hae Min Lee. As you get to the final episode, you have to decide who you want to believe, Jay or Adnan. I would recommend this to anyone willing to listen.","From the start I was deeply engaged with the podcast and binge listened to all twelve episodes and the additional case files.

I am of the persuasion that usually the media clutters their stories with personal bias based on their own political views. I can honestly say that this team is the best at presenting both sides of the story. They sometimes weigh in with their opinion but they do not hesitate to present the alternative view. I have never felt or been as engrossed with stories as much as with Serial. Give this a listen. Have an open mind. Realize that what you knew before was incomplete and was a sound bite and you will learn a lot and find that you knew less than you thought you knew.

Still, looking forward to season 3 and seeing what's next.  More mystery please :)  Deosn't have to be true crime...just don't give all the answers up front.  Give me something to ponder each week.  Or just go back to true crime haha."

Serial covers real world stories, told week-by-week (sometimes week-bi-week) in a serialized format. The first season covered a teenage murder trial from the 90s and season two just wrapped up covering the Bowe Bergdahl case. Both seasons delve deep into their respective stories, and keep you on the edge of your seat as the investigation's findings are uncovered. The show also has a knack for being thoroughly gripping. In the first season, host Sarah Koenig made dozens of phone calls to Adnan Syed, the subject of the season who was convicted for murder and is currently serving his sentence at a Maryland correctional facility. Listening to his story, listening to him claim his innocence, and then hearing Sarah dive in and try to uncover the truth is incredible to follow. Likewise, in season two, Sarah makes several phone calls to the Taliban — yes, THAT Taliban — all in the name of chasing the story.

2963,Awakethefallen,20160410T052543,5,Fascinating,"For the two ""Seasons"" it has aired, Serial has been a long-form story of a crime that has taken place. Each season covers one specific crime that has occurred over the course of ten episodes. In Season 1, we have the case of Adnan Syed, a person who has been convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. There are many things unresolved and questionable about the case that sent Syed to prison, so host Sarah Koenig, a former reporter in Baltimore, was brought in by a friend of Syed's family to take a look at the case to see if she could get to the bottom of the case once and for all. Season 2 of the show covered Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. If that name is not familiar to you, he is a US soldier who deserted his post and had been subsequently capturered and taken prisoner by the Taliban. So while the first Season covered whether or not there could be a definitive answer to the question of Syed's guilt, Season 2 covers the question of why did Bergdahl abandon his post and what the consequences of that action were. I prefer Season 1 of the show, I actually believe it is one of the primary reasons people are so fascinated by True Crime stories right now, with Making a Murderer following up Serial's success on Netflix. The did he/didn't he question of whether or not Syed killed his ex-girlfriend was a fascinating journey. To this day I flip-flop on what I think the answer to that question is. I don't hate Season 2 of the show like many, I think the question is interesting, there's just not as many twists and turns in the story as Season 1. Either way, I highly recommend checking the show out, it's great storytelling and I can't wait to see what Season 3 has in store for us.","For the two ""Seasons"" it has aired, Serial has been a long-form story of a crime that has taken place. Each season covers one specific crime that has occurred over the course of ten episodes. In Season 1, we have the case of Adnan Syed, a person who has been convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. There are many things unresolved and questionable about the case that sent Syed to prison, so host Sarah Koenig, a former reporter in Baltimore, was brought in by a friend of Syed's family to take a look at the case to see if she could get to the bottom of the case once and for all.

It's an interesting look at the validity of witness testimony and the justice system. Season 2 didn't capture my attention as much as Adnan's case, but that may be because I wasn't able to listen to Season 2 all at once. I tend to forget details about Bowe's story in between episodes. It's still an interesting story, but maybe for Season 3 I'll wait until I can listen to all episodes over a few days.","I love how in-depth this podcast is.

If you think she chose a great story last time, don't you think there's a reason she's telling this one? People calling Bergdahl a traitor are only showing their ignorance and willingness to judge before they've heard the story. Let's here what Sarah has found. She was given 1000s of stories to cover- there's a reason she picked this one.","After looking over the reviews from the 2nd season, I felt compelled to write.

3313,Glassesglam,20160129T013302,5,Fantastic For Gen Y,"This is the new version of hard news for people in my generation who use the newspaper to clean their windows. Sarah is strong willed, insightful, and humorous. The stories she has looked into this far make me think, talk with friends, and really wonder about society I am in. I love that the seasons 1) follow a story and 2) poke questions about what the macro environment is that the story takes place in. It gets me thinking. She works remarkably well without having Bo talk this season thanks to his calls with Mark. It is truly seamless. Also, even though I was admittedly first disappointed with the lack of ending in Season 1, the people who are upset about t are acting a bit ignorant. The fact of the matter is that it was a legal case, and there are (nearly) NEVER clear answers as to who did it in a murder case that goes to the court, and to think there should be is ridiculous. Think-- it's still unclear whether OJ murdered the girl, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most closely watched stories of the American public in the 20th century. Sarah and staff, keep doing what you're doing because it's fantastic!","This is the new version of hard news for people in my generation who use the newspaper to clean their windows.

I especially liked the episode format and Sara Koenig's casual interview style. The ethical questions that came up during and after the shows first season do complicate my appreciation. Do cliff hangers and narrative simplifications have a place in crime reporting? I am not sure. It was incredibly addictive and people were drawn into a great story. Unlike a serial drama there were no conclusions by the end of the season. Audience members ended up taking sides and became aggressive quickly removing any healthy discussion. I don't want to get into the issue of guilt or innocence. It was abhorrent the harassment committed bv strangers on the internet to people connected to the case. Serial needs figure out a way to distance itself from that subset of the audience. To maintain credibility Serial should change directions next season, away from criminal justice system. We will only know if this show is truly excellent once season 2 is released.

I’ve always felt the best sign of a good book is if I think about the characters when I’m not listening to the story and I definitely think about these guys. I gotta admit it’s a bit frustrating, so many questions to ask? Where’s the DNA evidence, why didn’t they question Don more? How about an interview with the parents? But overall so exciting and interesting. Is this guy sitting in jail when he shouldn’t be? Is the real killer still out on the loose? Or is he where he belongs? Can’t wait to find out… If you haven’t listened yet you gotta check this out! Congrats Sarah and the rest of the producers etc! Great job!"

Koenig comes across as a neutral observer of facts, a person who's not affraid to ask the hard questions, and yet at the end you can clearly feel how this series has effected her. The narrative presented leaks into every corner of your imagination as each new interview or interesting piece of information is revealed. By the end of episode 12 you'll have an opinion over who killed Hae Min Lee and no matter what conclusion you come to you'll still ache to know ""the truth"".","I came upon this in the ""Best of Podcasts 2014"" and saw This American Life attached to it.

I caught Serial late in its production, so I was able to listen without having to wait for new episodes. I tuned in on a whim, and then consume the entire podcast in a matter of days. Days only because life interfered with my desire to listen constantly. Otherwise, it might have been a matter of hours. I have come to expect a lot from NPR and anything affiliated with NPR, but this podcast was of a caliber that exceeded even my highest expectations. Although it feels odd commenting on the quality of Adnan's story given that it is true, I will say that selecting this case for further investigation was a worthwhile endeavor. Beyond the story though, Sarah Koenig's reporting, storytelling, and conversing were simply remarkable.

4142,Nesbolin,20141225T085306,5,Riveting,"I started Episode 1 yesterday morning (Christmas Eve) on my first two-hour drive of the day around 9 AM on a bit of a whim. I had been hearing about this ""serial"" but I really had no idea what it was, I just got the feeling that it was something big that I needed to know about. So instead of listening to the daunting pile of new music I had planned on gorging that morning, I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did. Three more long car rides and a regrettable time spent shoveling Biscoff cookie spread out of a jar (and into my face hole) later and I've consumed it all (partially literally). Now, at 2:20 AM the next morning (Merry Christmas), seventeen hours or so later, I have finished Episode 12. Because I got a late start, I obviously binged. I can't imagine now having to wait weeks for this story, I could hardly wait an hour between episodes. It's that good. While part of me needs this mystery to be wrapped up in a tidy package like a present under the tree, another part of me knows that life doesn't happen that way, and the same part of me really doesn't want there to be a pretty solution—after all, this is a very messy case. I must say that Koenig has a true gift for storytelling, and given such a thin case she has no problem bulking it up. I was fully enthralled the whole way through, even when the more monotone court proceedings came up I couldn't possibly be bored. The podcast format completely activated my imagination and I've resisted looking at photos posted to the website until the end. I truly care about these people, even the minor ""characters"", it's the strangest thing. It's an absolute joy (and at times discomforting) to feel, as a listener, that you are pinning down this case right along with Koenig and her colleagues. Your opinion becomes just as valid as anyone's as the story progresses, an element that captivates the listener in ways I haven't experienced before. At times I found myself in the car gripping the wheel so tightly that my hands turned red. Many times I burst into tears, but never for more than a minute. This is a raw story with a vibrant, shimmering cast of characters. It doesn't seem real at times, given the circumstances. Reality creeps back in when you realize that as this podcast was being released, new information was surfacing. What a great element. Adnan Syed is superbly fascinating. Sarah Koenig delivers his story in a truly human manner, and after more than a year of pouring her heart and soul into this case she has more than enough to show for herself. These are real people and it clearly shows. I can't say enough about this podcast. Listen and thank me later. And Koenig, if you're reading this for whatever reason, bravo. Season 2 can't come soon enough.","I started Episode 1 yesterday morning (Christmas Eve) on my first two-hour drive of the day around 9 AM on a bit of a whim.

I normally don't have the attention span to listen to people talk for an hour so I don't bother with podcasts, and they're usually pretty boring to me. I had heard a lot of buzz about Serial and eventually saw someone on the train with it open on their phone and thought that I should probably give it a try. I started listening to episode 1 last night and just finished tonight, one night later. I can only imagine how frantic I would be if I listened week by week - something I plan on doing whenever season 2 comes around. My only disappointment, now that it's over, is that no other podcast will compare to the experience of Serial. Kind of like watching Breaking Bad and trying to find another TV show to watch but nothing else is as good.","I'm not a podcast guy whatsoever but this had me hooked from start to finish.

4152,beachredhead,20141223T192813,5,Now This Is Journalism.,"I can't get over how unique and engrossing this podcast is. I confess that I had no idea what it was, or that this was even a ""thing"" until the final segment had already aired. That's good, because I was able to listen to the entire story over just two days; if I'd had to wait a week between segments, that would have been unbearable. I'm a former Baltimorean, so I know the area well, which made this all the more intriguing. The Best Buy on Security Blvd? Yep, I know exactly where that is. Patapsco State Park? Been there too. Woodlawn High School? I've probably passed it hundreds of times in my life. But, I'd never heard of this story before, which may speak to the tenor of the times; a fairly run of the mill crime story for any urban area. Sarah Koenig takes a mundane whodunit and turns it into a thriller, but she never loses perspective, and never lets emotion cloud her task. This is journalism at its best. Well done, Sarah, Ira Glass and everyone else involved in this project. Let's hope the professionalism that you've shown in reporting this story is emulated by others in the media. We need that. I have seen a few stories that are mildly critical of how Hae's story has become ""entertainment."" Be aware that this isn't the case here. This is a sober, clear-eyed piece of journalism that's well worth your time. If it were in book form, no one would have batted an eye. And lastly, the score is superb. Not intrusive, and a perfect fit with the mood of the story. I cannot wait for the next installment.","I can’t get over how unique and engrossing this podcast is.

I recommend it to anyone, even those (like me) who are sick of crime shows.","I suppose I can understand why some people got bored once they got to the second episode, but I personally don't agree with these opinions because the second episode represents exactly why Serial is so great and sets it apart from other crime stories: personal, in-depth analysis and CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT (as opposed to a sole focus on plot, which gets so tiresome).

It actually feels wrong to write that it's ""entertaining"" given that real lives are being chronicled...perhaps ""fascinating"" is a better description. In any event, the narrator is a skillful orator who keeps your interest and the storyline is a real life ""whodunit."" The narrator tells the story of a real murder from various points of view, including that of the young man who was convicted of committing a horrible crime. In addition to revealing the various points of view, this podcast provides a glimpse of all the moving parts of our justice system from the initial investigation to the manner in which a defendant's lawyer handles a case (and the evidence he/she decides is important or relevant at any given time). At this point, I don't know who's story to believe so I anxiously await each week's episode to hear another piece of the story revealed so I can reach my own conclusion about the young man currently serving a prison sentence for murdering his ex-girlfriend. I'm hoping that this will be the first in a long series of true life crime drama podcasts.","This series is honestly so captivating.

4462,notamusicsnob,20141114T075737,5,Brilliant. Period.,"This show is beautifully paced. The style is compelling. The music is intense. The way they break their re-investigation of this crime into a different theme every week (alibi, the route, now Jay) leaves me on the edge of my seat. And like the host, I keep going back and forth on whether I think he did it. (What do you wanna bet that the show doesn't answer the question...) I see two kinds of critiques. (1) ""He's obviously a murderer so investigating the crime again makes me mad,"" and (2) ""it's so long and boring."" There's not much I can say about (2) except that I don't understand how your mind works if you find this boring. I'm on the edge of my seat. As for (1), I think it really says a lot about you when a host who talks A LOT about how she goes back and forth on Adnan's guilt = a shill for the defense. That THE REASON you don't like the show is that you're asked to keep an open mind while they look back over the evidence. So many criminal cases are like this - there's some good evidence, some mistakes by the police, some bad evidence, some suspicious stuff the defendant did - and then we ask a jury to sort it all out. I wish police departments had some kind if review boards that would take this kind of thorough, unbiased second look at all cases. Or just hire Sarah Koenig's team to do it.","This show is beautifully paced. The style is compelling. The music is intense.

As a listener, the more I've heard the more I've become on-the-fence about Adnan's innocence which upsets me because I genuinely wish for a happy ending for him so it would help to hear about his reaction to the news. I feel like there's an unmistakeable honesty that comes out when you hear such a thing about a person you once cared so deeply for.

While the law issues are the most important parts, those issues are naturally going to be answered last, if they can be, but because the host does a great job of exploring the intriguing social aspects of what kind of character the suspect is, the audience forgives being strung along for the ride. Again, fantastic show, keep up the good work.","The first season so far is fantastic.

I'm hooked on this one already and I can't wait to see what the other seasons have to offer. The reporters do a good job of giving nuanced clues in general. However, they make it seem like the main character is innocent, some of the issued raised overall are pretty interesting. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes 60 Minutes, This American Life, or Dateline type shows.","Although I like the novelty that This American Life has by keeping each theme different every week, this podcast does a good job of asking some serious questions about this specific case.

Listening to several episodes, I can tell you I would have hardly any memory of anything that happened 15 years ago while in school, but my friend was not murdered/ accused of murder, so it's hard to say...  I find myself really thinking hard about the details, timeline and everyone's stories and am not sure I believe or disbelieve anyone at this point which is interesting because I believe Sarah is in the same boat.  I think that is what makes it so powerful. I also think her story telling style and even her voice works well in a podcast format."

I say all that to say this... Serial in its entirety is a driveway moment. Could their be a higher honor amongst public radio aficionados? I think not. Around the office we've dubbed it the ""True Detective"" of podcast. It's a slow burn podcast that isn't wrapped up with a bow at the end of each episode. There's a reason to keep tuning in. Serial is a must listen in a age saturated by podcasts. Great work to everyone on the team, I hope this message reaches you.","If you've ever listened to an NPR pledge drive you've probably heard the term ""driveway moments"" thrown around.

4817,Ryaaaan,20141008T065911,5,A Gut Punch To The Soul,"I cannot help but writing this review. Serial is a podcast format unlike anything I've ever heard. Though the This American Life producers are masters at condensing compelling stories into short formats, they've unbound themselves from the shackles of the traditional hour-long radio format to create a spinoff show, Serial, which dedicates an entire season dedicated to investigating and telling a single story. Sarah Koenig makes a masterful debut. In uncovering the tragic story of the murdered Hae Min Lee, Koenig leaves no stone unturned. She digs deep into the personal lives of Hae Min and her ex-boyfriend and accused murderer, Adnand. Her story includes reading excerpts from Hae Min's diary, digging up her intimate and sometimes silly memories of teenage angst that everyone has experienced, albeit not as publicly as this. Koenig weaves an incredible story of the role that love, heartbreak, sex, murder, lies, drugs, religion, and family plays in these teenagers lives. She does this without leaving listeners feeling like she's exploiting the story of the deceased Hae Min. I don't know how she does it. It's sublime. I cannot wait for the next one. Listeners beware, this isn't a fun podcast. It's incredibly dark, visceral, and will fully engulf you. There's a moment when a certain RandB song plays in the podcast that punched me in the gut. I was a teenager in 1999 and that song meant to Hae Min the same thing it meant to every teenager, and it brought the feelings home closer than I was prepared for. Thank you folks at This American Life for venturing into another format. Wait 5 years for my income to go up a bit and I'll throw all my money your way.","I cannot help but writing this review.
