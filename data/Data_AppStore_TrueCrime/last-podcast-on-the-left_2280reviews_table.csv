They do good research and have great topics but I can't get past the failed attempt at comedy. It's wedged in constantly and these are good guys but they're just not comedians. I think they'd blow up even more if they just stuck to being informative. Comedy is hard. This shows that.	I‚Äôve tried a few times with this podcast.

Jenny Riot	20230301T054405	5	An Acquired Taste.	When I first attempted to listen to LPOTL a handful of years back, their energy was WAYYYY too much for me. Henry did a guest spot last summer on a podcast I subscribe to and I suddenly made the connection that he was from Pretty Face - so I thought I'd give the guys another shot. So glad I did! Now it's one of my comfort shows and I really care about these creeps. Great content and I really enjoy listening to their banter.

YUsucksobad	20230215T091225	1	"Definitely Not ""Unpredictable"" Anymore"	"My girlfriend and I went back and listened to a few episodes from around 2016 over the weekend. The difference in quality and overall entertainment value between that group of irreverent goofs not taking themselves seriously and whatever the show has become is night and day. The sad part is I think these guys still somehow regard themselves as transgressive, when I haven't heard a single word come out of them in the last two years that wasn't absolute conformist hackery. The ""Hail Satan"" schtick seemed like a parody of guys attempting to be edgy when they first started. Now it's like elementary school kids trying to shock their mom by quoting snarky kids from a Nickelodeon series. I get that they eventually managed to monetize the show by playing ball, and I assume Spotify gelded them as part of their contract a couple years ago, but Jesus....it's embarrassing how cowardly they've gotten. Ben never had a spine or identity, and you can listen to him completely reinvent himself politically, etc., over an unusually short period for a grown man, and Marcus is the textbook kid who got picked on (or at least imagines he did in a sort of self-pity revisionist framing) so now he lashes out at any value system he associates with his faux persecutors and/or where he grew up. Those two goofs sniveling to avoid friction seems on brand, but Henry is the one who truly surprises/disappoints me. Henry is exponentially more talented than the other members of the program, exponentially sharper than the other members of the program, and was the only guy ever really pushing the envelope when the show first started. Now they're about as edgy as 2023 SNL if Chelsea Handler was hosting. I know she THINKS she's shocking people with the loud, drunk 50 year old woman trying to get a few more miles out of her lap before the menopause sets in, but really it just seems forced and sad. Like a lady who knew she couldn't pay the bills on the merits of her talent alone, so she had to desperately grasp for ways to shock. 2023 LPN seems forced and sad in the same way."

When I snapped back into reality the piece of paper was filled with scribblings on how to implement a one world government. No doubt is in my mind that from hours of LPOTL listening my mind has been filled with subliminal messaging from none other than Ben Kissel.

Henry is also one of the best comedy minds out there. However, this show isn't for those who are easily offended or can't appreciate incorporating humor into a podcast about very dark subjects. I don't recommend it to many people because I know many people will find it offensive. So I eat up all of the cult/ serial killer episodes, but am not interested in the cryptid/ UFO stuff. Please give us more serial killer series in 2023!	This is one of my all time favorite true crime podcasts ever, mostly because of Marcus‚Äô research abilities and structuring of the podcast.

Truly it becomes too difficult to even attempt at gleaning any sort of information about the podcast topic because they just can‚Äôt seem to get out of their own way. Will never try getting into this one again, don‚Äôt understand how this is rated so high‚Ä¶must pay well for fake reviews. Trash, I promise. Go elsewhere to ‚ÄúAstonishing Legends‚Äù or something.

The hosts are incredibly annoying, and I couldn't get through an episode that sounded genuinely interesting (Jim Jones). The information I gathered was so cool, but ruined by their banter. Obviously I'm the minority with this opinion, so clearly it's enjoyed by most. Oh well lol	I‚Äôm late to the game and started podcasting recently. Was pumped to try this one.

whitneyv05	20230101T195341	3	Settling Into Mediocrity	This podcast is losing its luster as do most they gain popularity and money. I'm really over the magic and UFO/cryptid episodes as they are incredibly boring and just a waste of time. It was a real struggle getting through FOUR episodes on Jack Parsons that did not need to be that long, only to be greeted with the next episode on UFOs. It's just silly at this point. I enjoyed earlier episodes and series on The Mormon Church, Jim Jones, The Black Plague, USS Indianapolis, and some serial killer episodes that were informative and entertaining but we haven't gotten anything remotely close to these gems in a long while. Henry needs to be taken down a peg or two as he tries to steal the show with interruptions, jokes, and his own research which draws out these episodes. Marcus does amazing research and tells stories informatively- please let him be the driver once again.	This podcast is losing its luster as do most they gain popularity and money.

I_Heart_Puppies	20221127T135447	5	A Bit Much At First Listen But Now I Love Them!	I found these guys when I was searching for more on a specific serial killer and they had like a 4-5 episode series on him. I wasn't sure if I was into them the first couple of episodes because they are pretty big personalities. You pretty much can't listen to them in public without ear buds because of the innuendos and jokes about criming. What they offer is a very unique, interesting, and well researched edutainment experience! It's a comedy-true-crime pod but they have an enthusiasm for a bunch of other subjects that I've never looked at before such as alien abductions, cults- not just the murder ones!, a bit of the spooky supernatural stuff, they go through the origins of esoteric and new agey practices, and some conspiracy theories. They have a unique perspective as current satanists that came from various christian sects which I think explains their fascination with religion and it really doesn't feel out of place here! I enjoy and appreciate their fun approach to conspiracy theories. They did a wonderful MK Ultra series and they were *very* clear about what parts were proven and known and what was heresay, conjecture, technically possible, feasible, etc. But they still had fun with it in ways that I don't think would've put off conspiracy enthusiasts. I appreciate that they found their voice and format pretty early on so all the hundreds of episodes that they have are still enjoyable if you like their newer stuff.

The hosts make every effort to be accurate with their information and go out of their way to correct themselves when they get things wrong. I have chosen to stop listening to this podcast following the conclusion of Episode 377. The primary reason is because of the politics. The hosts, with the exception of Marcus Parks, insist on inserting their political views into the story at every opportunity. For this reason and this reason only, I am done. The stories are well written, the research is thorough, and the commentary is very entertaining. This is the podcast for you if you do not mind some left of center political commentary, love true crime and esoteric topics, and want to binge (there are hundreds of episodes).

I found this podcast while looking for people who had covered serial killer Herb Mullin. 40 minutes in they had still said little about Herb Mullin. I appreciate constructive digressions but this stayed so far into often uninteresting territory (a few tidbits were interesting). But mainly I couldn't stand the unfunny banter - there's little worse than listening to people crack jokes amongst themselves and laugh incessantly - and you don't find them funny at all. Kudos to those who enjoy this. I prefer podcasts that get to the point, and keep pointless banter on the editing room floor.

He makes the show unlistenable with his constant interruptions, terrible impressions and 5th grade sense of humor. The other two guys do a genuinely good job. I understand some people are into his style of comedy. Those are the same people that think Andy Samberg is the funniest man alive. Just not for me. I wish there was a version of this show that featured only Ben and Marcus.	Henry is that one friend that thinks they are hilarious, but in reality they are just extremely annoying.

Poor Research	20220810T165614	1	From Awesome To Awful	I was a huge fan up until about a year ago. Now it's more and more politics. I'm not a disciple of either side- I'm one of those super rare people who can see that Trump was nuts and also that Biden is horrific. Both of things can be true at the same time- crazy, right? Anyways the final straw was when the boys started making fun of people for wanting to exercise medical freedom over their own bodies without being ostracized from society. That's when I bailed. Don't get me wrong, the research is still phenomenal and the guys are hilarious- but I've personally witnessed people's lives get destroyed by the same policies that the boys giggle with glee over and relish in the harm it's caused for people.

They play off each other so well and I love it when any one of them just starts uncontrollably laughing. I don't really mind when they meander away from the topic for a bit, usually it's brought back around and it also helps lighting the dark topics they discuss. I appreciate the research that goes into each topic and as I'm listening to it I do really feel like I'm getting accurate, thorough information without much bias (which I hear in some other podcasts about TV). I'm only on episode 213 (Dean Corll) so I have quite awhile to go! Great job, guys!	LPOTL one of the best podcasts I've ever listened to. The chemistry between the hosts is pretty magical.

Guido da Montefeltro	20220717T081550	3	Peaks And Valleys	"I've been listening to the Last Podcast On The Left for a good five years now and, as many have stated, the show got off to a rocky start. They really hit their stride around episode 250, thanks in large part to Marcus Parks and his in-depth research. Henry Zebrowski's humor is more refined than it was at the start, and some of the show's best episodes kick in around 2017, including the series on L. Ron Hubbard (261-264), Carl Panzram (271-273), The Enfield Poltergeist (279-280), Norwegian Black Metal (285-287), Jonestown (301-304), Richard Kuklinski (326-328), and The Donner Party (331-332). Ben Kissel and Henry Z. began ""Side Stories"" in 2018, but without Marcus to guide discussion, it's not worth the time. Two years later, Marcus Parks began his own podcast, No Dogs In Space, which outside of Cocaine and Rhinestones is the best music podcast out there. All of this to say that the last three years have seen a dip in quality; Marcus is still a great writer, but his usual depth is being allocated to No Dogs. Henry's shtick has become mundane, and Ben Kissel, with his constant wrestling references, repetitive phrasing (absolutely!), and casual cluelessness (who knew Dave Davies was the lead singer of The Kinks? Kissel apparently thinks so, as he repeated this a half-dozen times on this week's Side Stories episode) has made the last 100 episodes or so almost unbearable- see the MK Ultra series (482-486) or Blackbeard (491-493) for recent examples. As you can tell by my references here, they cover some truly interesting topics, and Marcus Parks' research is still better than 95 percent of what's out there, but it's become like trying to have a serious conversation with someone in a restaurant while two people at the table next to you are laughing loudly nearby."

They talk about the crime for a minute or so and then continue to scream over each other so their jokes can be heard or they can make a random noise.

Also it seems the guys are heavily Democrat, Ben's in between but they treat republicans like scum including saying many times ""they are scum"". Trump was made fun of rightfully many times but stay constant. Biden can be made fun of with a lot and they just don't. Research great, humor good, but not equal almost as if they are scared to on a few things, yes scared to."

Phoebe LM	20220325T113632	1	Hosts Have Add	I listen to many true crime podcasts and YouTube channels, I've heard this podcast mentioned in many of them raving about how great they are, so of course I had to check it out. The first time, I picked a random episode and the chit chat was all over the place it didn't follow the topic barely at all. The next time I picked the Robert Hansen episode and instead of talking about this guy they end up talking about everything but Robert Hansen. They say one sentence about the topic then go off in 15 directions. Do all the hosts have ADD? By the time they say the second sentence about the topic, I'm like what the heck are we even talking about. This is definitely not for me, which is a let down because I really want to hear about some of these topics.

Many of us found ourselves with too much time on our hands. Restless, listless, bored. Brains melting to nothing from the cycles of day drinking and Xanax consumption to ease the anxiety of life. Hours spent on the toilet scrolling mindlessly. So many choices, and yet, still so confined. Hobbies that once would have received a scoff were now trending. Rug making, bread baking, once considered menial tasks or tedious chores were now being re-branded. I found myself drowning in boredom and despair... will there ever be a light that emerges from this tunnel? This truly terrible dark night? All hope seemed lost. That was until I was told about Last Pod. Now, now I say, hope is found! This choir of voices, this Terrible Trio, these Mad Men have provided both education and entertainment. Humor and depravity.

"So, I hadn't gotten in the podcast world until 2021, and no I didn't get into podcasts because of Covid.. but my brother told me about ""Last Podcast on the Left"" one day and I thought I'd give it a go. I already loved true crime and crazy historical shows.. this was the the first podcast I had ever listened to, and in the beginning,I listened to this podcast on my way to work and on my way home from work a few times..I can't remember why but at that time I couldn't get into it(just being real), but one day a few months after, I randomly I picked it back up and I fell hard..in love with this podcast and these 3 amazing men/comedians/podcasters..so it became an obsession. I listened to them on my way to work, at work, on my way home from work, then once I was at home from work for a little while I would just sit in my car, smoke and just forget about the rest of my day and the world, and binge this podcast, until.. one sad day,I had caught up on all the episodes.. I have to admit I hate having to wait every week for a new episode now. I've actually gone back to past episodes because they were so good, I don't do that with any other podcasts! I've tried listening to other podcasts with humor, and hosts talking to each other like these guys do.. but I haven't found any other podcasts that are even remotely close to the enjoyment, knowledge and entertainment that I get from ""Last podcast on the Left""! I even have my mother listening to them and she usually tries to avoid shows that are more rated R (lol) and they can get vulgar at times but she's a history nut and she loves listening to them! This is a brilliant podcast, with brilliant hosts..each episode is very well made, and exceptionally researched ..it has everything that's ever raised an eyebrow or two in the world of popular-controversial and conspiracy type history, true crime of every nature, UFOS/Aliens, and I'm so grateful you guys have given the world an amazing opportunity and gift of such an awesome listening and educational experience! I have really learned a lot of information I either didn't know or thought had happened different way. I honestly look forward to a new episode every week! This is hands down, don't care what anyone else thinks or says..The best podcast out there! So if you don't know by now, I'll remind you..I LOVE IT! It makes my day and the dynamic between Ben, Henry and Marcus is genius, and they definitely got it right!"

I even have my mother listening to them and she usually tries to avoid shows that are more rated R (lol) and they can get vulgar at times but she‚Äôs a history nut and she loves listening to them! 
This is a brilliant podcast, with brilliant hosts..each episode is very well made, and exceptionally researched ..it has everything that‚Äôs ever raised an eyebrow or two in the world of popular-controversial and conspiracy type history, true crime of every nature, UFOS/Aliens, and I‚Äôm so grateful you guys have given the world an amazing opportunity and gift of such an awesome listening and educational experience!  I have really learned a lot of information I either didn‚Äôt know or thought had happened different way. I honestly look forward to a new episode every week! This is hands down, don‚Äôt care what anyone else thinks or says..The best podcast out there!!!!
So if you don‚Äôt know by now, I‚Äôll remind you..I LOVE IT!!! It makes my day and the dynamic between Ben, Henry and Marcus is genius, and they definitely got it right!!"
cannolli head	20220215T213304	5	The Best Podcast Of All Time.	Hands down. Hilarious. Informative. Marcus Parks is the best in the business at researching and telling a story. Henry Zebrowski is one of the best character comedians any where ever. I mean anywhere. Ever. And Kissel. Ah, Kissel. He's just so so Kissel. For anyone who enjoys true crime, or (like me) more the paranormal stuff, it's just the best by far.	Hands down. Hilarious. Informative.

Like 5 part series where each episode is an hour plus. Guys, maybe it's time to just write a(nother) book? Or just pare it down a little? Guessing this isn't a problem for most. Congrats on still being the one podcast my wife is disgusted by - the real mystery is how this show has so many female fans... lol	Long time listener, tune in for every show, Spotify or otherwise.

It's extremely disappointing, and it's quite brazen since it has only been a few weeks since the LPotL episode. Last podcast on the Left is ‚Äî rightly ‚Äî a legendary podcast. It should always be in your top five. It has evolved over years, and the boys (Ben, Marcus, and Henry) have grown as writers/researchers/comedians/actors/podcasters and their presentations of the subjects they discuss have matured as well. They cover a range of topics from paranormal phenomena to UFOs (one of Henry's favorites), true crime, cults, and Norwegian death metal (some of the funniest episodes ever)...and that's just the beginning. What is marvelous is that the boys are hilarious but the sweet frosting on the cake is that Henry and Marcus in particular spend serious time researching their topics ‚Äî so for better or for worse Henry should be awarded a Ph. D. in UFO studies or Ufology (as a Ph. D. myself in a real academic field I think it's safe to say he's done enough research on his topic to hold a proper academic position!). Marcus has an encyclopedic knowledge of esoterica, all ""strange"" matters, and especially true crime. It all makes for a brilliant combination of genuine wisdom and rapier-like wit."

They cover a range of topics from paranormal phenomena to UFOs (one of Henry‚Äôs favorites), true crime, cults, and Norwegian death metal (some of the funniest episodes ever)...and that‚Äôs just the beginning. 

What is marvelous is that the boys are hilarious but the sweet frosting on the cake is that Henry and Marcus in particular spend serious time researching their topics ‚Äî so for better or for worse Henry should be awarded a Ph. D. in UFO studies or Ufology (as a Ph. D. myself in a real academic field I think it‚Äôs safe to say he‚Äôs done enough research on his topic to hold a proper academic position!). Marcus has an encyclopedic knowledge of esoterica, all ‚Äústrange‚Äù matters, and especially true crime. It all makes for a brilliant combination of genuine wisdom and rapier-like wit."

A lot of research goes into each episode, which I cannot say about other podcasts... way to go! Switching to Spotify? No problem. Like myself, you guys need to make a living in your career.

magyikmilk	20200219T052426	1	Ugh	Was suggested by some friends, listened to the caller episode around Halloween time and that was interesting. We were on a road trip and decided to give a recent episode a try. That was a mistake. They are not PC at all ! The racist jokes and the slurs against the LGBT community honestly took my back a bit. I don't get offended easily but that was just horrible I have to stop listening. I tried 2 different episodes and stopped 3 minutes into both. The whole car was stunned. Not recommending.

rcastor1216	20200217T221841	1	Insensitive	I have listened to some of their episodes before, however; the columbine episodes struck a chord with me. In the first episode they address that there is no easy way to address this topic, not even 10 minutes into the episode they laugh make horribly offensive jokes about how those kids probably regret wearing the outfits they did that day because their new outfit was all ruined, make horribly offensive jokes about suicide, and make racist jokes comparing the gunfire to that of an Iraqi wedding. I'm usually not one to get offended easily, but these jokes and the way they handled the topic were appalling and pathetic.

Jacob Computer	20200217T195654	1	Frankly Against The Spirit Of Podcasting	The show was a lot of fun and I've really enjoyed it since I started listening sometime ago. I realize that the podcast itself is a business and everyone needs to make money but I view Spotify exclusive networks as against the spirit of podcasting and damaging to the platform. Spotify wants to run the entire podcasting game and I hope you all realize that. If you are against a single company controlling the entire podcast world then you should be against their move to become a Spotify exclusive. These guys deserve more income but for the sake of podcasting as media, I hope they come to their senses and realize that they are contributing to the destruction of their own medium.

They did what they loved for a long time with little money or listeners just because they wanted to and loved it. Their move to Spotify is awesome because Apple will eat up so many friggin podcasts in the next couple of years- making you pay for things that should've been free to begin with. A good example of that is the podcast ""Love and Radio""- they were an awesome podcast, so pleasing to listen to- but they moved to a new platform that costs money to be a apart of. That's not how information should work. Another reason is that they now will have more resources to continue to make awesome content and even more fantastic things for us.

gene_parmesan_2021	20191230T180606	5	My Favorite Podcast	One thing I can say after listening to everything they have put out in chronological order all in about 6-8 months is: they have been doing this since 2011 and have evolved A LOT. If you are like me and you need to digest everything from the beginning, give them a chance and know that they get better with time. The sound quality improves, their hosting improves, their research improves, and they also seem to hone their comedy. Henry used to be more offensive, which was actually when we was so unhinged he'd make me crack up out loud, but I have to say I am glad they have matured past the point of race-based-humor.

Tttia75	20191218T165751	5	My New Favorite!	I'm a big fan of true crime podcasts. I don't know how I didn't find this sooner! I had binged a few and ran out of episodes so I can across this and was instantly hooked. I usually don't like true crime podcasts that try to be funny but this is genuinely funny and gets the facts right so it works. I found this a few weeks ago and had already binged about a third of the episodes. I can't get enough! My only feedback would be that I much prefer the true crime episodes more than the alien episodes, but thank you for keeping me entertained!	I‚Äôm a big fan of true crime podcasts.

Sai Leigh	20191216T194108	1	Disorganized And Offensive	I'm not super conservative so I can tolerate and sometimes laugh at inappropriate, race-based jokes, but this podcast is definitely overrun with them. They interrupt the main story way too often with racist remarks and mimicking stereotypes - it gets old fast and makes it incredibly hard to follow the story, which initially sounds interesting. Really disappointing since another podcast I love recommended this one. I'd say easily 2/3 of the material here is unnecessary and just not funny.

Podcasts like this grow in popularity because they are easily accessible. It's a RSS feed that anyone can access from a ton of different devices, apps, etc. Hell I can throw it into Internet Explorer and could still access the show. Moving the show to Spotify means you will only be able to listen to their show using Spotify. I don't use Spotify to listen to my podcasts. Most people who listen to podcasts don't either. Most have a single app where they can create their lineup of shows to listen to and then binge through them. What this show is asking now is for us to make an exception to hear their content. Now I will have one place to listen to all the rest of my shows, but if I want to hear LPOTL I have to open a totally different app to do so and have an account (free) to hear it as well. These guys don't understand that creates a barrier to hearing their content which most casual listeners will not bother to do. I predict a large drop in listenership simply because it's too much of a hassle to go somewhere else for a single show. I know I won't be doing it.

If I could rate the earlier episodes separately I'd give them 5 stars. Yes, the modern show is more professional, well outlined, better researched, but it's definitely lost all of its DIY charm. The humor is more restrained to appeal to the wide audience, you've got fake ""Jeeeze"" and ""Oh my god"" peppered throughout the more morbid episodes, and sharp cuts from laughter back into the script happening constantly. It used to just be casual conversations about true crime amongst friends who didn't feel the need to apologize or justify their jokes, or act shocked about what they're reading. Seriously, you've covered the most gruesome serial killers in history all while laughing at how insane it is, and now you're going to act surprised when you hear about someone getting murdered? Now the show is moving to Spotify, which means it's getting more corporatized, not less. I hope they do well there. I for one, will not follow."

That's not even saying much because most of them don't do ANY research on the topic they're discussing. After the ""Alien Agenda"" episode I had to unsubscribe.

Several people have recommended this podcast to me and now I have to question their mental competence. I‚Äôve tried. God knows I‚Äôve TRIED to listen to this podcast! I just can‚Äôt ever make it past 15 minutes.
It‚Äôs just a handful of hyperactive, not very funny and not very witty bro‚Äôs trying to out-joke each other. I‚Äôm constantly waiting for one of them to drop the classic ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she said‚Äù at any minute.
The details of each podcasts subject are lost in the melee of shouting and over speak. That‚Äôs not even saying much because most of them don‚Äôt do ANY research on the topic they‚Äôre discussing.
After the ‚ÄúAlien Agenda‚Äù episode I had to unsubscribe. The jokes stereotyping Asian lady‚Äôs as bad drivers was just dumb and offensive. You guys went to far.
Listening to this podcast is like being at a bad cocaine party at a frat house that‚Äôs gone on way way too long."

They present the facts, but they also intertwine humor into it (where appropriate). They make you laugh after getting really freaked out about something they talked about or bring humor into things that otherwise terrify and fascinate me.

THAT SAID, prepare yourself to cringe whenever Ben pipes up. The man is a miracle in that he's landed a successful career in the exact medium he's the worst at. He's inarticulate, tends to get louder and louder (side stories are a misery only because Ben's role is enhanced and he yells the whole time), he can't read and at least 75% of his movie references/word pronunciation are waaaay off. He also tends to lose himself mid sentence and then sheepishly bumble his way to the finish. Next to Henry, it is shocking that Ben is considered a ""comedian"".

AMS311	20191018T130000	5	Where Do I Begin	I listen to this podcast almost every day at work. I started this year and have gone as far back as this app allows to listen to older episodes. It's weird going past 2016 (in a pre Trump world) because it's like they predicted it all. On a lighter note, the podcast continues to give me nightmares which means they're doing a good job. Each episode paints a very detailed picture of the topic, and the humor keeps me coming back every day. Feels like I have friends at work that I can relate to and get me through the day. Henry is one of the funniest comedians I've ever heard and everyone should agree. EVERYONE. This week I listened to the Columbine episodes, and really enjoyed the horror show of a nightmare I had the night after‚Äî I got shot in the head but survived? Then gave the finger to a bunch of teen punks on the street that were making fun of me and my siblings and cousins, until they pulled out a rifle and started shooting us. I got shot in the knee. My cousin and I then tried to hide in a parking lot but the shooter found us but got distracted and left us. My brother died. Needless to say I woke up UNrefreshed and fearful of the world. But as always I came back for more and continued my day with the Jon Benet case and Murderers of the American Frontier. I am so glad Henry shares my view that we are ALL JUST HOLOGRAMS AND LIVING IN A FALSE REALITY. I love this show so much and appreciate Marcus, Ben and Henry for persevering all these years and doing all this research for their fans. Thank you for bringing a macabre smile to my face every day and hope to see them live somewhere. So ya you should 100% subscribe. Hail Satan	"I listen to this podcast almost every day at work.

Mr. Dr. Burns	20191015T205216	5	My Favorite Podcast	I started listening to these fellas right before the last presidential election. I needed a break from non stop politics, and this did the trick. It revived my interest in fun topics like hollow earth, 50shades of grey aliens, the financial plight of Bigfoot hunters, and even serial killers. My wife is the serial killer fan, but at least now I can pretend to keep up. I am a squeamish person, there are a lot of horror films I just can't watch, but I love this podcast. I am still trying to figure it all out. You should too.	I started listening to these fellas right before the last presidential election.

Blackdahlia656	20191001T173902	1	Was Great Until Pc Culture Got To Them	Used to be great but as time goes on they just get more and more politically correct and start virtue signaling. If you're even slightly conservative you'll also get to hear their bias against you while never making fun of the other side of the political isle.

I had never listened to this show before, but I saw the Mormonism episodes and listened to one because I think religious debate and analysis is interesting. However, the show was less of that and more making fun of our religion in a very offensive manner. I'm not one to get offended easily, but I was appalled at what I heard in the episode. We are not a cult. I understand if you think our religion is weird and if you don't agree with our beliefs. I also respect your opinions and your right to free speech, but maliciously attacking a religion or group of people is never okay. We believe that just as much as you claim to.

The only minuscule point that I have to bemoan is that they covered WACO way too early in the run. Before the research got so tight. I beg of you (them zir astralkin) to redo WACO as a well researched multi-episode run. Perhaps combine it with Ruby Ridge, or cover both with the failing of the ATF in the 90's. So much was left on the table with the WACO episode! To arrive at a maniacal sinful messiah is just following the mainstream press bastardization of the affair. There is so much more to it. From WACO: Rules of Engagement documentary to Janet Reno and the Clinton Whitehouse to Vince Foster, and on and on. This topic is a Zebrowski goldmine. Please kind sirs of LPOTL; please.

When they are just monotones telling facts it can‚Äôt keep my attention not even on stories I‚Äôm massively interested in!! So I realized! Henry jumping in to make jokes and change it up makes it where it wakes you up and makes sure you are paying attention!!"

LPOTL is the most well researched and entertaining podcast you'll find on the internet. It's definitely worth your time.	Humor, true crime. Satan; what else can you ask for in a podcast?

And they were loud and obnoxious so I didn't revisit it for a long time. Once I gave it an honest go, these (three) dudes won my heart. They're weird, quirky, and love what they do. The stories they cover are up my alley as a lover of all things mystical, paranormal, extraterrestrial, and true crime.

"Decided to leave a review after seeing some rather negative ones....I have really enjoyed this podcast ever since stumbling upon them awhile ago while searching for a true crime podcast. In fact, these guys have SO MUCH personality it has absolutely ruined so many other true crime podcasts I try to listen to! Their energy, relationships and sincere love for what they do make listening to other podcasters feel like listening to paint dry! I had no idea the rabbit hole I was going to fall down after listening to my first episode because I have binged nearly every true crime and serial killer episode these guys have done. While not all the topics are for me, these guys are highly entertaining and despite what some say, hilarious and I enjoy the three different personalities they each bring. Is this podcast for everyone? No. Neither is plaid or crocheting. My point is, is that if you get offended easily by ""insult comics"" or comedies like broad city or Family guy, you won't enjoy this. And if you are waiting for the rapture clutching your rosary pearls, Mary, then I suggest you bypass these boys because this is all in fun and not meant to be taken so seriously. Henry is hilarious. Detective Popcorn changed my life. Can he be crude? Sure. And I love it! Every time he says ""what?"" After Kissel's sometimes random commentary I laugh. Marcus' research skills and delivery are unreal! Living in Texas (although not from Texas originally) I totally get what he refers to at times and he seems like a pretty chill guy. And Ben adds that grounded element that really helps to balance out these three personalities and keeps things interesting with his counter-perceptions and bud light limes. These are the kind of guys you wanna go have a beer with after a hellish day at work. Sure, there are some jokes that I thought were almost borderline....being a gay man there have been a couple here or there where I was like, ""that was a close one guys"", but they constantly reiterate their love and support for the communities and the people they all joke about (except maybe the Hyatt place they seem to really hate that :face_with_tears_of_joy:). AND DESPITE WHAT SOME SAY THEY DO NOT VICTIM BLAME OR VICTIM SHAME. They're like the best friends that can ""say those things"" and get away with them because you know it's meant in good fun and not meant to be so serious.

Brett3.92	20190907T070647	3	Could Be Exceptional	"TLDR: Mainline episodes are informative and well made, but Side Stories episodes are annoying and poorly made. Humor lands about 75% of the time, but discussions tend to delve into guilt tripping and other weird ""modern humor"" topics. If you can ignore that sort of thing being brought up quite frequently, or you agree with their positions whole-heartedly, you'll probably get a few laughs and be entertained. When I first started usingiTunes, I found a podcast called ""Weird Things,"" which discussed topics like the paranormal, true crime, and weird tech news. Eventually, I just stopped really enjoying their content, so when I found this podcast, I was interested. The mainline episodes are entertaining, and are usually quite well made. The three hosts specialize more in true crime rather than the paranormal, if that matters to you. They, also, attempt, and mostly succeed, for me, in interjecting a lot of humor into the subject. Most mainline episodes are incredibly well researched, with a few exceptions, unfortunately, but are very informative about the subject. The Side Stories episodes, however, are not nearly as well made. There isn't a script they reference, jokes tend to be all over the place and usually don't land, and the information just isn't as specific and detailed as in a normal episode. Earlier mainline episodes tend to be less focused, by the three hosts always try to stay close to the topic. Side Stories episodes are just pure trains of thought, whithout much deeper thinking or researching. I gave this a 3/5 due to the fact there is almost two seperate podcasts being produced at the same time; one of which is good, one of which is bad. The hosts are usually funny, but occasionally go off on tangents that seem nearly identical to every-other comedian, nowadays, which doesn't help the overall score."

Joezwalez	20190906T235917	1	My Last Episode Of Last Podcast	"It pains me to have to unsubscribe from what was my favorite podcast after hearing one too many anti-police statements From Ben Kissel. As a proud police officer in a major US city, I have turned the other cheek several times as Kissel continues to regurgitate the trendy disrespect towards law enforcement that runs rampant in America right now. But when Kissel stated in a recent side stories episode that he believed that the young white man who killed the baseball player's wife and child in Florida was only spared being shot in the head by the responding police officer due to the pigment of his skin, it ruined the podcast for me forever. As a police officer who has been in the same situation several times in my career, I find it asinine for someone to think that an officer would allow such a factor as the color of a persons skin to enter into the split second decision to use lethal force or not. Kissel never related whether the individual was armed, which I assume is because the article he was citing did not mention this fact. Regardless of the fact that the male was naked and covered in blood, if he was not armed and did not pose an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or civilians in the area, then the officer has been trained to result to varying levels of non- lethal force to neutralize the threat, one of which is the use of mace or pepper spray. For Kissel to later state that this was a situation where he believes an Officer would be justified in using lethal force, without having knowledge of the presence of a deadly weapon being possessed by the individual, shows his ignorance of standard police practice and training. And it was even more disheartening to hear Henry agree with Kissel at the end of the conversation. Perhaps Kissel should educate himself further on the various escalating level of force policies of police departments in the United States before further bashing the brave men and women in blue who put their lives on the line everyday to protect and serve the citizens of this country. And maybe Kissel should try to research ( or ask Marcus to research) some of the countless stories of brave men and women in blue who have shown almost ""Super-human"" restraint in similar encounters, as these type of stories would fit right in with what made me enjoy TLPOTL so much. Unfortunately, I won't ever get to hear it."	It pains me to have to unsubscribe from what was my favorite podcast after hearing one too many anti-police statements From Ben Kissel.

I have always loved true crime, the paranormal, and just generally the darker subject matters of life and this podcast really brought that joy and fascination back into my life. Yes the subject matter is often very dark and disturbing but the way they discuss it really helps make things more palatable. Some other reviews say they go too far with these jokes but I have always had the mindset that joking about these things really help cope with how horrible people can be.

Garth K	20190817T033611	1	Used To Be Great. Now Just Political :thumbs_down:	The early episodes of this podcast were amazing! So entertaining, well researched and very interesting. Now you should just rename it Abe Lincoln's Top Hat #2. I don't even disagree with you politically but I'm so sick of hearing about it and every episode you seem to add more and more. Unsubscribing and hoping to find another entertaining podcast that's doesn't just end up a political rant.	The early episodes of this podcast were amazing!

They are consistently able to present information and have pleasant banter. Henry is wildly obnoxious, frequently offensive, and occasionally racist. His jokes are funny 1/10 tries and he seems to think he's way funnier than he actually is. I still love listening and his idiocy doesn't diminish the listening experience too much, this would be a top notch 'cast if Henry wasn't involved honestly.	This podcast is genuinely enjoyable.

Each of the three hosts brings a different kind of brilliance to the table. They are thorough, eloquent, well-researched, and hilarious. Sometimes the humor is clever and sometimes it's dumb, but I mean, that's every day real life comedy baby. They are some of the most hard-working and fan-oriented people in the biz, and I appreciate them so much. They do a live stream once a week and I would recommend checking it out because getting to see/know them makes the podcast even better.

austinmoore2010	20190802T132933	5	Long Lost Friends	I recently stumbled onto TLPOTL and was instantly doubled over in laughter. Each episode is better than the next and even better the second time around. Marcus Parks aka dog meat is the man with the facts. And his laugh is the most contagious, possibly a future murder accomplice? You tell me! Henry 'Hong Kong 'Zebrowski is the funniest man alive, keeping the podcast listener in shape from laughing so hard. With them big GD HANDS! Lol. And last but certainly not least, the elephant in the room -Ben Kissel is the voice of reason and devils advocate. Is he a time traveling nazi? Possibly. He seems like he ran thru many a polish towns toting an mg42.... or was that his grandfather? Either way these three form an unholy trinity and I say to them.... HAIL SATAN! HAIL GEIN! HAIL YOURSELVES! MEGUSTALATIONS!	"I recently stumbled onto TLPOTL and was instantly doubled over in laughter. Each episode is better than the next and even better the second time around.

alyssareneee	20190801T223300	5	The Best!	This podcast is so great. The boys are hilarious and Marcus is always so prepared with the information and facts about the topic. Definitely worth a listen if you love to learn about the macabre and the supernatural. To those who say this lacks the female perspective: that's because they're literally all dudes. How can they provide a perspective that isn't their own? If you want the female perspective, go listen to My Favorite Murder. You guys are awesome. Don't change a thing.	"This podcast is so great.

I got an iPhone and the first thing I did was subscribe to LPOTL and the second thing I did was write this review. Pros: LPOTL is highly therapeutic. When I feel bad I listen to Ben read Creepy Pasta and everything is right with the world. Cons: I now feel like most people are serial killers and that the moon is hollow, but Trump is president so any dystopia is possible.	"I realize I could have written this review via Android, but no.

Sizzle3184	20190801T014920	5	Great Podcast	"Been listening to a ton of podcasts but needed a break from the politics and found LPOTL through a friend who's been singing praises for years. These guys are fascinating- Marcus' narrative style mixed with Henry's improvisational ""history acting"" and Ben's pleas for common sense and normalcy make me laugh to myself a lot, while listening through my ear buds. Not a podcast to listen to with toddlers in the car but a great podcast for a couple who likes to watch the travel and discovery channels. I have learned so much and can't wait to hear what else they cover."

I read comments that they don't have a woman's perspective, and I wholeheartedly disagree. They're really well-educated about bias and prejudice, individual and systemic, against bipoc and women, etc. Someone talked about how the JonBen√©t case had gross comments made about the victim- it's smart and informed comedy. If you take what these guys say at face value and don't understand the nuances of what they're doing, you're a goon, and you're missing out on quality content.

The Jonben√©t Ramsey story made me incredibly uncomfortable... the way these men spoke about a young girl was extremely vulgar and cringe worthy... Content like that will create a haven for the sickos of the world that like to participate in bad things involving children. One of the fellows in the show was fully aware of how the other man was speaking and even basically told him to tone it down, should have been cut out of the show all together. I literally listened over a month ago and I refuse to support content like this.

I can understand why this show may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I find it to be the right balance of informative and humorous. They find ways to joke about the absurdities while still handling heavy situations with respect. I appreciate the guys' willingness to dive into the complexities of mental health, gender, sexuality, etc., while exploring the world of true crime and supernatural conspiracies. It makes for a very genuine listening experience. Much love to the LPotL cast and crew!	"I love this show and am so happy to have discovered it!

lb-19	20190717T213500	1	Well.	After the many recommendations from other true crime podcasts, I finally listened to a few episodes. Needless to say, the dark humor and ridiculous jokes about the horrible acts of crime that this podcast covers is disturbing. I am someone who is usually not sensitive and can handle a little humor about crime here and there but this is absolutely disgusting. also hard to follow the plot because of the yelling and frat comedy that is constantly bogging down the story line. Would only recommend this to someone who is into fart and penis jokes or likes to laugh at unfortunate victims.

jordanh742	20190717T131726	4	Super Interesting	I love this podcast, I love how each episode is structured (especially for the serial killers and conspiracy theory episodes). I like how they have someone research everything they cover on the episode and they go in depth on all of their information. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because sometimes the hosts get very distracted on their talk tracks and I find that to be a waste of time because I have to keep skipping through it until they get back on the subject. Other than that, I love their content and their humor approaching this material. Good job guys!

Mollysgolden	20190717T030735	1	I Really Tried	I really tried to like this podcast. After my girls at MFM kept referencing it, I knew I had to give it a try. But my god, that one dude who is so obnoxious and is constantly interrupting makes listening to this podcast a nightmare. I really think I could like the pod if it was just Ben and Marcus. Also the overtly racist imitations of other ethnicities is cringeworthy. That humor has never appealed to me and demeaning anyone for their race, disability or gender really isn't ok. Aside from that, I do enjoy the researched cases and subject matter but again‚Äîalmost impossible to enjoy with that obnoxious guy having to get a word in every time someone else speaks.

All three of these guys are just wonderful at telling a story when they go into the main part of the series or when they are doing Side Stories. After hearing the Bonnie and Clyde episode to the completion, I was on the edge of my seat and I KNEW how the story ended but to hear it from them, it just made it exciting and gripping. I was yelling in my car when it came to the shootout! I've just started listening for the past few months as it was the LSOTL that brought me here. While I really like the show and seeing the boys, the LPOTL is where its at! Love it! Lastly and sooo not in a creepy way but it totally sounds like it, Kissel, I want to have your baby! LOL The man is just hot, what can I say. I now measure all potential suitors that I will date by his standards. Yummy...But I guess all I can do is sigh at him and daydream while watching the show...All the more reason for me to keep watching the streamings. ;)	I have to say that I LOVE this podcast!!!

If you dislike laughing and being able to enjoy something for an hour or two don‚Äôt bother with this podcast. Thank you guys so much.

I had never listened to any podcast show, period, until my friend recommended that I listen to Last Podcast's deep dive into the story of Rasputin, and now I'm hooked. Ben, Marcus, and Henry do an excellent job researching and delving into these twisted and delightfully macabre stories. It's a great balance of humor and information, so it's always engaging. You tell can these guys love what they do and they are good at it. 10/10 would recommend especially if you're a true crime fan	"I had never listened to any podcast show, period, until my friend recommended that I listen to Last Podcast‚Äôs deep dive into the story of Rasputin, and now I‚Äôm hooked.

lindar007	20190621T081641	5	My Favorite/ Go To	I've been listening to this podcast for over three years now, and I have never been disappointed with an episode. Not only is every single topic well researched, but the episodes contain a perfect balance of information, commentary, and humor. Although it can be crude at times, it's a good way to break up the heavy topics the episodes deal with. The three hosts each bring their own distinct personalities to the show, and the way they banter between themselves makes the show feel more laid back rather than other informational true crime podcasts. I always find myself relistening to episodes and eagerly awaiting the new released every Friday. Even though I've listened to many other podcasts, none of them compare to LPoTL for me. Thanks Marcus, Henry, and Ben for your hard work and I hope everyone gives this podcast a chance.

Usually this makes the show more relatable and entertaining but LPOTL guys spend so much time talking in frat humor, gibberish, and inside jokes that after a couple of episodes I really felt like I was eavesdropping on a private conversation and should see myself out. I could've ignored this if the guys actually talked about something interesting or entertaining like their podcast titles suggest but all too often they introduce the topic and quickly veer off into their bro comedy. When they finally get back on topic, I've already zoned out and lost interest already because I've googled the topic myself. Maybe this could be a hit to some but I found it to be uninteresting and tedious to follow.

Disone72	20190602T110107	1	Disappointing	I was psyched to find this podcast given their immense back catalogue of interesting topics. Was extremely disappointed in their delivery. This is basically men with DJ voices who act like 12 year-olds jumping all over themselves trying to be funny. I listened for 20 minutes while one of the hosts tried to set up the premise for the story while constantly being interrupted. You don't have to say every f-ing thing that pops in your head. Less is more. Unsubscribe.	I was psyched to find this podcast given their immense back catalogue of interesting topics. Was extremely disappointed in their delivery.

Mcinhinaz	20190530T004544	5	Newer Episodes Shine Where Older Episodes May Disappoint.	I genuinely wonder what episodes many people who review this podcast negatively are listening to when they listen for the first time. If you start at the first episodes available via the iTunes Store you may feel disappointed because (as with all things, including Podcastery) experience pays and good things like this Podcast take time to genuinely develop. Marcus (who does the majority of the show's research) has clearly developed as a storyteller learning to integrate multiple stories into a cohesive tale. Henry still rocks shocking jokes, but with much more acknowledgement and sensitivity to contemporary issues, and Ben as the show's perfunctory 'straight man' better reels in tangents when the team ends up too far off topic. The jokes are crass, the subject matter is morose and unsettling, but if politically incorrect levity + murder/conspiracy/aliens is not your cup of tea, then you should probably move on.

But Henry and Marcus's jokes about disabled people quickly cross the line into mockery and outright disrespect, and they refer to at least one person as ""retarded"" in pretty much every episode, a word which has been considered a slur for a number of years now. (Most of their jokes about the disabled community have nothing to do with the killers they're discussing).

anniebotic	20190528T163154	3	Meh	I love the topics these guys cover; the problem is that listening to them is sometimes a chore. When there is constant screaming, there is straight up sexism and racism. Also, I get they are meant to be a comedy podcast, but sometimes they seem to forget that they are talking about real people. Make fun of the criminals all you want, go to town, but when it comes to the victims, there should at least be at least a little respect, if not for the victims themselves, then for their families. This is definitely a podcast to listen to one episode at a time and not a bunch of episodes in a row.	I love the topics these guys cover; the problem is that listening to them is sometimes a chore.

I get that comedy doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù but it‚Äôs not making me laugh.

Goopunch66	20190524T124257	5	My Favorite Podcast	I started listening to this podcast about a year ago and I became a fan instantly. These guys are hilarious and the topics are super interesting. They really seem to do their research on the topics they cover and they do better than most true crime shows that seem glorify the killer at the expense of their victims. LPOTL shows these people for who they really are and, in a way, advocating for their victims. Furthermore, their ufo, urban legends and paranormal episodes are extremely entertaining and fun to listen to. I forgot how much I like to nerd out to that stuff. Love this show, hail satan.

jenn_crom	20190522T142235	1	Annoying	After two podcasts recommending their Jonestown series, I decided to listen. I really wanted to like this podcast but it's like frat dudes decided to party with a 12 year old boy and they are all trying to one up each other by being obnoxious and telling jokes that are well, just not funny. It's almost like listening to the Douche bit from Parks and Rec for hours. Any quality research or story telling gets lost in an annoying interjection that forces the listener to lose focus of the story. The interjection would be fine if it added value but it doesn't. I listened to the whole series hoping for decent content and didn't receive it until the last 25 minutes of the end of the series. Still, thinking maybe it's just me, I tried to listen to the JonBenet series and was absolutely disgusted by the sex jokes about a 6 year old murder victim.

Supervisor Hob	20190509T233401	5	Dark Humor With Your Best Buds	Three best friends hanging out, talking about horrors both real and imagined. That's what it started as. Over time, LOPTL has morphed into an incredibly well researched and insightful view into the macabre, the horrific, and the mysterious. And it manages to remain absolutely hilarious all the while. By their own admission, the show took a while to find its footing, and I wouldn't recommend any new listeners start at episode one. Instead, I'd encourage you to read through the backlog and pick out a topic that sounds interesting to you. Personally. I think the Jonestown series is one of the best they've ever done. It stands on its own not just as a gut bustingly funny comedy (which it is) but also as an in depth and fascinating breakdown of an often misunderstood tragedy. Littered with in-jokes and callbacks, there are many Easter eggs for the hard-core fan, but don't be scared off! At the end of the day, it's three best friends looking at the worst that humanity has to offer, and choosing to laugh at it. Hail yourself! Megustalations!

IsabellaCClark	20190504T001740	4	Prolonged Exposure Is Recommended	My first episode by these guys was Albert Fish (yikes), and I couldn't stand them because they seemed way too obnoxiously comedic about such a rough topic. My curiosity got the better of me, however, and I kept coming back to listen to more and more forked up history and comedy- but now with an idea of what to expect with their jokes (very dark humor that is not intended to be taken literally but instead to lighten the mood surrounding horrible situations). It's easy enough to skip 15+ seconds when squicky topics come up or to skip episodes entirely if they have content that you don't feel comfortable consuming. UPDATED REVIEW: I don't think I'd recommend listening to the episodes before 120 (maybe a little higher) unless you're really interested in the topic because it can get rough in the vein of 'we can be racist towards the Irish because we're racist towards everyone!' They have changed, though, and shouldn't be judged by things they said years ago when they seem to have changed their behavior towards sensitive subjects.

Therefore the comedy at times is ridiculous, crazy, wild, dark, etc... if you are looking for highbrow comedy, this is not the podcast for you. Don't expect to think deep about the comedy - and that's ok. It's rather great. The last thing I want to do is take a deep dive into the annals of comedy theory when I listening to stories about a psychopaths murder spree or alien abductions. I think this podcast is very well produced. The stories are well researched, and attention to relevant details when telling the stories is perfect.

If you have a problem with how it's produced, the quality of story that's being told, or wish to air your grievances that will help make the quality of the podcast better, by all means give your critique.

I‚Äôve recommended these guys to many friends, and will continue to do so!! 10/10!

The episodes are very well researched, building a style after years and years of development. I will suggest that new listeners may be overwhelmed by starting with the most recent episodes and should start near the beginning of the series. So many inside jokes and callback references add so much more to the experience, even during some of the most gruesome of episodes.

They also tell stories of conspiracy theories and aliens if you're into that sort of thing.

Shanegam	20190422T155735	5	True Crime Satire	"FOR ANYONE NEW TO THE SHOW: it is three real life friends (Marcus Parks, Ben Kissel, and Henry Zebrowski) who all enjoy stories of the occult, conspiracies, and true crime. They are all comedians who get together weekly to discuss a new topic related to these areas. Marcus Parks is primarily the researcher of the stories they tell; he presents the story and gives detailed descriptions of true events. He is the ""story teller"" of the group. He is exceptionally well spoken and typically sticks to relaying facts of the story and providing commentary, often with a dark twist. He is the one you will hear laughing the most frequently throughout the shows. Ben Kissel is the ""host"" of the show who greets the audience at the top of every episode and introduces everyone who will be joining them for that episode. He essentially plays the role of the ""Politically Correct"" member of the group who will act as the voice of reason when storylines begin to take a dark turn. His sense of humor is very palatable for almost anyone, and includes just enough dark humor to remind you that this is a crime podcast. Henry Zebrowski is often introduced as the ""special guest"" although he is present in almost every episode (this is either an inside joke among the podcasters, or an indication that Henry is not guaranteed to be present on every single episode). Henry serves as a counterpoint to Ben, satirically shooting down all reasonable ideas and insisting that things such as ""reptilian men"" and ""project MK Ultra"" are among the most powerful things on Earth, and control all of our lives. Henry is a hyper, ""yelly"" presence in the show but his obscure commentary is welcomed in the midst of the dark topics this show often covers. The three of them compliment each other nicely and if you are a fan of dark comedy and/or true crime this is the podcast for you. I feel like a lot of the people who are rating this 1 star don't realize that these guys are satirizing true crime stories. Obviously all three of them are comedians and everything they say has to be taken with a grain of salt‚Äîit is NOT for anyone who only wishes to know the facts of true crime, for them I would recommend Dan Carlin‚Äîthe podcast is meant to be 50/50 satire/informative. Although Marcus is extremely well read and Ben has a legitimate political background, these are all AMATEUR HISTORIANS (no disrespect to the hard work done by everyone at LPN, but some of these people need to know these guys are not professional historians relaying solely facts to the audience, they are comedians telling stories that THEY find interesting). OF COURSE the shows consist of a lot of meaningless banter, that is what attracts half of the audience. LPOTL does a fantastic job of telling both obscure and widely recognized conspiracies and true crime stories, once you become accustomed to the roles of each member you can truly discover how unique and effective they are at doing exactly what they intend to do‚Äîentertaining the audience while entertaining themselves, it's what we come to listen for."

"While at times crudely funny, unfortunately ""The Last Podcast on the Left"" has plenty of misogyny, anti-Semitism, and racism dressed as comedy (e.g., quickly laughingly dismissed comparisons of certain ethnicities to other primates, which they've let slip on a few episodes, despite their hosts usually hewing closely to contemporary standards of decency/""political correctness"") and the podcast is often very irresponsible in its frequent reiteration of absurd, baseless conspiracy theories. See, e.g., the Waco episode: few legitimate sources cited, terribly biased, etc. See also, e.g., Episode 71 (2/16/15), where they disingenuously qualify their reiteration of ""Boston Marathon"" conspiracy theories with qualifiers like, to paraphrase, ""I'm not saying there WAS a conspiracy, but [an unidentified] THEY'RE are saying that..."", and then follow-up/support the particular slanderous conspiracy theory with middle schooler-level Chomsky/Zinn-esque invectives against the media, government (another amorphous ""they"" the hosts regularly rail against), and society as a whole. Ben, Henry, and Marcus frequently attempt to inoculate themselves from criticism that they're spreading and amplifying existing conspiracy theories by first lightly mocking the theories and the sources of those theories (e.g., their typical angle is something like ""You don't get it: we're totally making fun of [conspiracy theorist and/or the conspiracy theory]!""), but much of the time this doesn't absolve them, because often they'll mock a theory and its source, only then to put a slight spin on the theory and advocate passionately for it. E.g., to paraphrase: ""Source A says it was all planned by the government, which I don't think is true, but if you really think about it, I wouldn't put it past SOME elements of the government or companies like [military-industrial complex-representative firm] Y ‚Äî and you KNOW 'the media' are eating it up because they're in bed with them."" Stay perhaps for the ghost stories, but the discussions regarding current events and history are toxic, corrosive, and horribly ill-informed.

SavannaOhSavanna	20190415T054242	1	Yeah, No Thanks.	Another podcast mentioned what a great job this podcast did on covering a really interesting murder. So I looked up which episodes LPOTL talked about it and I got about 10 minutes in before I became super annoyed with the stupid laughter, phrasing and overall structure of the show before I said F it. They barely mentioned the topic or victims before their dumb comments and stupid side conversations sent them all into a laughing fit.

I do enjoy the side stories while I wait for the main meaty podcast episodes to drop. I will say that if you are not into dark humor/jokes or just very sensitive or offended when it comes to religious topics , bits of political jokes , or even bits vulgarity, odds are you won't be able to get into this form of show. I personally love this show and can't get enough of it! I can't say how much I go back and listen to the old episodes throughout the week while I wait for more. All I can say is , KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK GUYS! HAIL! LAST PODCAST ON THE LEFT!	"I‚Äôve always been one for horror stories and dark messed up humor.

UNC Brandon	20190415T024012	5	Very Funny And Informative	This is a great podcast. It's very funny, extremely well researched, and more than once has made me laugh on tough days. I sometimes even listen to certain episodes more than once. Don't be lame and leave a one star review, and don't be overly sensitive. I'm sure those who have been offended have also laughed at things that others may find offensive so it's just being hypocritical. If only we could all leave Rick Santorum a one star review. Ben, Marcus, and Henry clearly have good hearts. Thank you guys, and I look forward every week to the podcast!	This is a great podcast.

Top_Chef92	20190414T223813	5	My Favorite Podcast	I think that Last Podcast on the Left is the BEST true crime podcast out there, of course I'm saying that because I'm biased and they favorite. They way the mix dark humor and hard to talk about subjects and even worse human beings there could possibly be, but they do it the best way possible. Also, it's the three guys who do the podcast as well. Marcus Parks is the hardest working man in the podcast industry be it shows. Each week every episode is well researched and laid out for even the dumbest listeners(myself) to understand complex topics. Henry is the funniest of the three. His improv skills are what the podcast the funniest. His impressions are the funniest as well, my favorite is of Charles Ng and what he brings to friendship, the listeners friendship. And the trio is rounded out by Benjamin Grant Kissel, the giant man with a bigger heart. What he lacks in research he makes up with heart felt comments when needed to cut the saddest and darkest of topics.

They are great at what they do and I appreciate the huge amount of information and the great bouts of laughter. They make you feel much less weird for finding this stuff interesting.

Marcus is extremely intelligent and one of the best and most dedicated researchers I've ever heard of. And he has the perfect voice to lead these horrific stories. Henry is absolutely hilarious and also extremely intelligent. I love his wide range of voices and impressions for each character within the story. Absolutely incredible work! And Ben is amazing!

TeganS	20190409T002352	5	Only One I Have Been Able To Listen To	I'm not sure what people are expecting or why they try multiple times. This is the only podcast about true crime I have been able to listen to. Most true crime podcasts are boring and many gloss over the details. These guys tell you the gory details and add humor to their episodes because they realize that listening to those details and learning about such heavy subjects can be depressing. Though I have a hard time keeping most of these serial killers straight, I've learned a lot. I'm not sure where people are hearing homophobic or racist jokes. Sure, if you are sensitive or easily triggered this may not be the podcast for you. The same goes for christians who have a persecution complex, or pretty much anyone who clings to their own religion as if it's their life force.

I fell in love with Henry on Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell and I'm so glad that led to my introduction to this podcast. I am truly obsessed - I even got my Mom to become a loyal listener.

rosiejka	20190401T173014	1	Now Unlistenable	The beginning episodes are excellent, well researched and funny. Now, they are unlistenable. The host begins to tell a story and can't get two sentences out before being interrupted by Zebrowski or someone else. Then someone else has to get a comment or two in- all of which are irrelevant to story. I don't know if these interruptions are meant to be funny but they are just annoying and distracting and cause you to forget what the episode or story is about. However, the beginning episodes are really good.	The beginning episodes are excellent, well researched and funny. Now, they are unlistenable.

Every other episode or so they cross that line and ruin a decent episode. Side stories is probably worth skipping. These guys forget that people listen to hear the stories and not lame jokes. Sometimes the humor is funny but usually just gross. Too bad. Henry Zabrowski is the crazy guy who rants on stupid stuff, claims to be a Satanist (oh how shocking), Ben Kissel is the moderator who doesn't contribute a lot and Marcus Parks is the only decent guy who actually tells you the story you want to hear about. After Henry went on a rant against Jesus around Christmas which was way way too nasty I decided it wasn't worth my time any more. Side stories is when they don't have an actual story but want to do a podcast anyway. They also are supposedly afraid of robots taking over the world- give me a break!

They definitely let their political affiliation show, and I wish they would leave that out.

I found LPotL three months ago and, since I travel for my work, have listened to roughly eighty episodes. My negative criticism and the reason for only a four-star review is the team's indelicate approach toward Christianity. If you listen to the show, you'll know that Ben, Marcus, and Henry have been hurt or maligned by the Church and are not Christians. I will not make you suffer a diatribe of how, ""I wish these boys were saved""-- even though I do wish that-- but will say I wish they would extend their impeccable research toward Christendom. They would make less mistakes on the show when commenting on Christianity, could peer beyond Christian folk religion or the grievous sexual sins of the Roman Catholic and Southern Baptist Churches, and find people like them in the Church (except without the drugs... mostly)."

The boys‚Äô humor can be a little brash, but this show feels like an informative conversation between spooky nerd friends.

Dano The Awesome	20190304T025001	5	Amazingly Amazing	I've been listening to this podcast for years. I love to spend my long drives, walks, or drive to work with Ben, Marcus and Henry. LPOTL feels like I am hanging out with hilarious friends as they talk about the sickest, weirdest and goriest things on this strange planet. The cool thing is that you actually do learn a lot about these monsters or topics! I was able to help my daughter with a report on 9/11 with a little help from LPOTL! Sure, there are haters who don't get their humor or their style. But don't let them change your mind to have a listen. Grab a Budlight Lime, kick back and have a great time. Also I vote Puffin for our adorable overload! Hail yourselves!	"I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast for years. I love to spend my long drives, walks, or drive to work with Ben, Marcus and Henry.

My favorite things about this podcast is how much research is put in to every episode, and the hilarious dark humor that ironically lightens the subject matter. I've always loved supernatural and true crime shows but had horrible anxiety due from watching them, but thanks to Henry's jokes and just the overall humor from the boys has actually made me feel calmer and able to tune in without the normal ""ooo evil scary killer"" tone of almost all other true crime podcasts. This is my favorite podcast and I can't stop recommending it to all my friends."	"Woah the 1 star reviews are extremely harsh and I feel that my boys don‚Äôt deserve it at all!

Magic Sawdust	20190302T152448	3	Disappointed..	Last Podcast was in my top 3 favorite podcasts for years. I've listened to some of the Big Hitter episodes an unreasonable amount of times and had a blast seeing them live. However, maybe they have run out of interesting topics or something but the last few dozen episodes have been total misses. I'm really disappointed with how uninteresting this show has become. Maybe revisit old topics? Find some Big Hitters you missed? Try...anything interesting? 3 Stars for nostalgia-sake.	Last Podcast was in my top 3 favorite podcasts for years.

Serious Sofa	20190227T024604	3	Lost Some Of Its Edge.	"It's an overall fantastic podcast for those with a penchant for black humor, but has started to downplay the comedy in favor of a more serious format now. While I can ultimately recommend LPotL, I do think the direction the podcast has taken it's comedy has been personally a little disappointing. There's a lot of things that make Last Podcast unique, but I think the most obvious hook for newbies was the unique pairing of black comedy with serious true crime. I wasn't even remotely interested in true crime, cults, cryptozoology, etc when I was introduced to the podcast by a friend a few years back- a lot of it seemed too serious and morbid. LPotL changed that for me by making a lot of outright horrific things very funny, often times in a sophomoric way that was elevated by Ben and Henry's improv skills. They've started to move away from that humor- and sure, you can make an argument for it. But the crude, edgy and politically incorrect humor was what made it work so well for listeners like me. There was nothing clean, friendly or comfortable about a lot of the horrific stuff they've covered, so leaning into it and laughing at it did a lot to make it enjoyable and informative all at once. I think that's why I find the episodes from 90 towards 250 or so remain their best work; they had struck the balance of serious material and buffonery perfectly. As it stands, the trio have begun handling most of their material a lot more carefully and seem to handle it all more seriously now. The humor is a lot more ""respectful"" and safer to compensate for the weight of their topics (RIP Hong Kong Henry Zebrowski) It's a little less frequent altogether as well, making more room for information and facts. You can see a lot of this in comparing their early episode on Japanese war crimes to that of the recent series about the war crimes of Josef Mengele. Hell, the stuff that qualifies as Gold Star material (the most horrific and grisly details) in the new episodes has nothing on stuff from earlier examples like Albert Fish. They shy away from the details more these days. This doesn't make New LPotL bad per say, but you should know what to expect coming in: it's earlier stuff was an informal, sardonic comedy podcast, and now it's a more empathetic podcast focused on informative lecturing with some lighter jokes punctuating the material. Somewhere in the middle of these poles was the perfect balance of the two, but that's come and gone. There's also just a lot more ads with newer episodes. That comes with success, I suppose. All in all, you should still give them a listen, especially if you're curious about true crime in general- you will learn a lot and laugh a lot too. Just expect to laugh a little less with their newer stuff."

Last Podcast is in a class all its own, thanks to its incredible hosts and support team. There is no other podcast out there that offer the familiar feeling of close friends sharing their favorite stories the way that LPOTL does. If other reviewers are turned off by the jokes, or the macabre nature of many stories, then this podcast simply wasn't made for them. Frankly, I wouldn't want to hear a podcast that was.

As for me, I absolutely love every aspect of this podcast! Every story is very well researched. Especially those about true-crime unlike other true-crime podcasts (*cough* MFM *cough*). Marcus lays out a great narrative, Ben asks questions to keep the story rolling and Henry provides the comic relief. Some might see it as in-bad-taste but, I like to see it as making light of bad situations. They have never idolize the grotesque, appalling, or strange antagonists in the true-crime stories. Rather, they make them the butt of the joke! The topics are somewhat dark or on the fringe but those are always the stories that absorb us the most. Extremely entertaining, very well produced, and all around extraordinary.

jojobean1247	20190129T085602	5	Megustilations!	I suspect that this podcast saved my life. I realize that that sounds awfully dramatic, but it might be true. Some time ago when I was going through hard times and was feeling particularly alone I was told about this podcast. Immediately I was intrigued and, after listening to an episode, I was hooked. There's something special about listening to funny, engaging human voices when you're alone. At the time I was only looking to fill the silence. But i quickly came to appreciate Ben Kissel, Henry Zebrowski, and Marcus Parks for more than just their wit and comedic timing. It's the sense of camaraderie and inclusiveness that draws me back to this show again and again. I'm an outsider like these guys. Their voices kept me sane and grounded for a long time and for that I'll always love this show. Hail Satan.	I suspect that this podcast saved my life.

Personally, I am interested in serial killers and cults, however, it's the stories that make this podcast great. Due to the thorough research and the character voices, you can really see everything happening just by listening. These guys have a great way of balancing each other out to put on an awesome show.

Most of the other true crime podcasts either deliver the material so dead-pan that I find myself losing interest, or blabber for the first 15-20min about nothing! They deliver it in a way that doesn't leave you so disheartened with humanity that you need to watch videos of kittens and puppies for an hour or so afterwards to snap out of it. I listen to several true crime podcasts and LPOTL is BY FAR my favorite.	These guys nail it every time! I've been listening to them for the last few years and they never disappoint.

Skhouvong	20190109T192118	1	Greay Subject Matter Poor Delivery	I really enjoy the subjects covered but the overt enthusiasm is somewhat distracting. I suppose being comedians it's a part of the schtick but at times it was hard to follow the program with the bombardment of useless and irrelevant information blended in with constant over talking and frantic manner in which the hosts communicated. It was almost like the hosts were competing for how much speaking time each could claim and getting a word in edgewise was the goal, less a host miss their window of opportunity and the conversation barrels on.

They come to the table with a lot of facts, but they constantly make racist and sexist jokes at the victims expense.

@creativelynk	20190108T202935	1	Too Many Anoying Impersonations And Sick Jokes. Was Hopeful, But :\	Impossible to listen to with the one guy always making impersonations and weird sound effects. Seriously, just not even funny dude, it's so over kill and ruins my focus on the stories. Reminds me of an annoying elementary school kid just crying for attention. A lot of the jokes are also just not funny, disrespectful and pretty messed up (when you're talking about innocent people, most importantly children dying- learn what is too far). You can still be funny and tell these stories with humor to make them less sad, but learn how to weave out the sick inappropriate jokes, plz.

Leffodea	20190104T161759	1	Disappointed...	I tried SO hard to love this podcast. The subject matter is literally everything that I love; cults, serial killers, anything taboo and freaky is awesome. However, these guys really ruin it for me. They interject the awesome stories with vulgarity and seem to look for any reason to about their sexual organs. I mean really? I'm totally not a prude in anyway (considering I'm interested in taboo/weird subjects). It really just ruins it for me. I have tons of friends that really enjoy this podcast, and I respect the hard work and dedication that goes into doing something like this. I also totally get this is THEIR podcast and they can do and say whatever they want. It's just my opinion...they should tone the constant vulgarity down a bit and focus a little more on the story. It's just a little unnecessary, and I feel like they are selling themselves short with the cheap jokes.	I tried SO hard to love this podcast.

Wes E Wes	20181228T174038	2	Hosts Can'T Get Out Of Their Own Way	The podcast is whiplash inducing in terms of how I felt about it. It's as if a sentient subreddit decided to produce a podcast. Underpinning everything wrong with it is a solid narration of facts, history, and content. This is only punctuation however to an onslaught of attempts at pythonesque comedy, bad accents, and adolescent vulgarity for its own sake. The hosts just aren't as funny as their unrelenting laughter at their own jokes suggests they believe they are. There is no point of levity or genuine humor brought up by the central narration that isn't promptly followed by sophomoric riffing to the point of exhaustion. Perhaps mildly entertaining if you were knocking back a few brews in person with them, but as a podcast their lack of self awareness and/or inability to edit down their banter makes hitting the skip button irresistible after about 20 minutes. This may be some people's cup of tea. These guys seem to have a formula down that appeals to a certain crowd who want to hear a group of dudes knock back some cold ones and try to imitate the Holy Grail. For me it felt more like watching the a show with someone who insisted on constantly pausing to crack jokes or bring up their own interesting topical trivia. The content is being run over by slap happy hosts. I give it 2 stars because their is about 1/3 of the episode that will be genuinely interesting or good content and it could be a much better show if they could figure out how to stretch that out. While some belching and swearing could be charming as nuance or highlight, this feels mostly like a group of dudes chewing the fat while one of them actually researched and tells the story.

When I asked her how she knew about it, she simply said, Last Podcast on the Left. I immediately checked out the episodes and I was hooked. It took me a few episodes to match the voices to the men behind the show but now I can honestly say I am unabashedly hooked.

If you‚Äôre going to give it a try, I‚Äôd suggest one of my favorites, the Enfield Ghost episodes."

Marcus, Ben and Henry are a complimentary triad whom each add their unique personalities perfectly to the fragile soup which has become an audio empire. Personality along with a generous helping of extensive work curate top-notch entertainment and deep analysis all of humanity should be grateful for on topics that range from a vast array of serious true crime to outlandish weirdness. No complaints from this listener...Other than Ben happens to leave his scarf loose at times. :fried_shrimp: *Tuck that scarf in Ben!* They may not be the heroes that the Historical Society of Podcastery necessarily want but they're certainly the champions this art form deserves. Looking forward to the next 10 years of brave service from these articulate gentlemen.

Pooooptart	20181211T210327	1	Just No....	I love true crime but this full of terribly unfunny jokes and so much side talk that it takes forever to get through what the actual podcast is about which is actually often an interesting topic. The show could do itself a favor by losing Henry and his unending 13 year old humor. Tried several episodes but it's the same thing again and again.
