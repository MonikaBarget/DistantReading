These things are a drag: No money in my pocket Amanda Gorman's poem Joe Biden as president And the sun shining on my face
She is breathtaking yes, the sad part, when the government is involved, the shade will stay in so many ways. Paying immigrants a great sum, when our hardworking people are limited our social security. Our soldiers killed when coming out of Afghanistan.......but the Lord above is our hope and I believe has given this special lady a very special heart.
I found this a bit verbose.
Let's go Brandon.
What? I thought trump was still prez
so inspiring

what an annoying rhetorical style
It's interesting to listen to Amanda Gorman's brilliant poem and to see it was obvious to everyone and definitely to Amanda what had happened, so in the future when people say they didn't know, they are lying. " We have seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded ":
@Jonny Propaganda trump might be elected again in 2024.
History has a big fat library of their traitorous acts. One of the most shameful periods in American history. We don't talk about trump losers anymore, we're the future.
this is amazing
9k dislikes? Jealous people lol
NICE POEM BUT YOU NEED TO BE REALISTIC PEOPLE DO NOT GET ALONG THAT IS THE WAY THE WORLD Will ALWAYS BE
Well I think she agrees with that. ‚ÄúQuiet does not always mean peace‚Äù pretty much says that people only get along on the surface but their discontent should be expressed
Much better than Donald's circus show haha
Jimmy neutron head ahh

What a dumb ass poem
@Toxic Politics Fair point. But for the record, Hulk is not the most poetic person. Hulk poem: Me Hulk. Hulk Smash. Smash smash smash. Grrrrr. SMASH. -polite applause
@Jonny Propaganda I luv Hulk üòÅ
smart word make man feel dumb. Hulk SMASH.
Don‚Äôt know whether to like this because it‚Äôs a fantastic speech, or dislike because she gave me homework
Well I disliked it because it's a dumb ass speech
so touching for an excellent video
LOL whatever you say
You communists couldn‚Äôt win the election legitimately so you stole it by using mail in voting. Joe Biden is an illegitimate president. Correction: an illegitimate dictator!
Yawn. Hi Russia.

Her words historically approach Lincoln's addresses in it's fluency. Someday maybe she will be a leader and this poem speech as an opening to her future.
America didn't elect Dementia Joe.
@Carol Smith Russia, this is pathetic. You're fresh out of fools to gaslight.
@Jonny Propaganda Joe and Kamala don't trust President Trump's vaccine. https://youtu.be/b8ilLJbvkus
@Carol Smith Got it. How dare he fulfill traitor trumps commitments! How dare he end the other sham war you guys started. Y'all are really reaching for anything anymore.

Yup. by a friggen LANDSLIDE. Proven by 60  courts. But note. We dont care if you make fun of Biden. Your old us vs. them doesnt work... i would have voted for a rock vs. traitor failure trump

they literally said white translator is not capable to translate Whether Gorman's poetry because he is not black THIS IS WHITE RACISM! DO NOT CALL ANTI-WHITE MOVEMENT OR WHITE RACISM BECAUSE IT IS JUST RACISM AND IT IS SO OBVIOUS TO UNDERSTAND SO I'M SAYING BLACK ACTORS/ACTRESSES SHOULDN'T PLAY HAMLET OR ROMEO AND JULIET BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT BLACK AND THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHITE HETERO LOVE! sometimes I'm so happy to say thank god I'm not from America
Where are you from? I follow your logic
Wonderful poetüíú
Cool, amazing for a black woman, mediocre for every other ethnicity.
You sould very much like a racist.
Her inspirational words of hope went right over the heads of all the racists on here
Some people will never understand the power we have when we eliminate the evilness from a creature no longer pure enough to be glorified in the presence of God therefore him and his followers ejected and now finds pleasure In watching mankind miss the opportunity to elope as one by finding the weak to keep us apart. They‚Äôre also hitting that dislike button.

Well, Amanda Gormon, tell me how you feel about Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and the killing of around 100 people in an ISIS k suicide bombing that happened as a result.
‚Äã@Z Floyd Because trump never botches anything.*** ***If you exclude losing: the senate, the house, Georgia, Arizona, the election, 60  court-cases re: the election, international credibility as well as his failed: COVID-response, insurrection, pornstar payoffs, university/real-estate/hotels/steaks/vodka/marriages/airlines/social media platforms But best of all he has exposed the rotten core of the republican party, and having lost all credibility as a governing party, y'all will never be back. tldr; Enjoy FINALLY being the minority you've always really been.
@Jonny Propaganda True, Trump made the plan. But Biden severely botched the plan in a way that Trump would not have.
Good thing traitor trump made that deal with the taliban... or is that an inconvenient FACT for your personal delusional narrative? Also, Biden never started an idiot insurrection nor killed millions of Americans with sheer ineptitude and negligence... but keep telling yourself whatever makes you feel good.
Good thing the Taliban has our weapons now. Now they'll have enough man power to destroy ISIS for good
@Geography, History, Geo Politics and more What? What you are saying makes absolutely no sense. First of all, what do you mean by "by the time Biden was in office"? And secondly, the situation in Afghanistan absolutely was Biden's fault. You may say "Well, Trump was the one who initiated the withdrawal". However, if Trump was in office, he would have actually planned the withdrawal strategically to get as many Americans home safely as possible, and he definitely would not have had the military leave their weapons for the Taliban to use to take over Kabul. However, Biden, being a weak president, botched the withdrawal really badly by 1, having the soldiers leave before the American civilians left, and 2, because he had the soldiers leave their military equipment in Afghanistan for the Taliban to take.
Sorry trumpist, by the time Biden was in office most troops from Afghanistan had been evacuated.
Poem for a woke communist...
a truly wonderful writer with a nice voice but I find this style of preformative poetry distracting. stop moving your hands so much lady
Literally made me cry when she did the R run considering that she once had trouble wiynthst. Legend!
When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We've braved the belly of the beast, We've learned that quiet isn't always peace, and the norms and notions of what just is isn't always just-ice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished. We the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And yes we are far from polished. Far from pristine. But that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true, that even as we grieved, we grew, that even as we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired, we tried, that we'll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade. But in all the bridges we've made, that is the promise to glade, the hill we climb. If only we dare. It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it. We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter. To offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert, How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be. A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation, because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain, If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy, and change our children's birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with. Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west. We will rise from the windswept northeast, where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states. We will rise from the sunbaked south. We will rebuild, reconcile and recover. And every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful. When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid, the new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.

Mr President Dr. Hakainde Hichilema Madam Vice Mutale Nalumango Zambians and the world at large. A FORD WE CROSS Our throats were dry We sought for a stream We asked ourselves about a day To seek less, quench our thirsty And live in endless harmony From injustice emanated chaos Selectivism sow division. Taking us back in the time Of colonial dominance. Sadly in recent time the division became amongst ourselves. Corruption has sullied our beautiful land Democracy had been by design tempered with,nearly chucked out but the voice of the people gave us a victory we embrace today. From afar the whole world witness The Beauty of her atmosphere All embraced are without fear Filled with Subtle feeling of peaceful happiness The world witness a new chapter A fragment of our history Full of hope and ambitions for a better Land,a land of fortune and dignity Innovation and free from oppression as well as favourable living conditions. A land Brimming in joy With Bursting relieving love Doves in the sky Attesting to its beauty,a safe haven for humanity Being the sole citizens of the land is an exceptional privilege we should take pride in, it is our inheritance Let us Help the land to attain its full Capacity,filled with light. We can make this land an epitome of hard work, peace, justice and equity That possibility compel us To be disciplined, be focused, the interest of our land is something we must prioritize. We can but it starts on the individual level Together as one we may not Be perfect but we have a purpose. We may be slow but can never falter We may be dirty but have a strong vision. As one darkness cannot to prevail The twinkling stars will forever copulate with the sound of a violin. Because; There are no restrictions in imagination you can be who ever you imagined to be, working hard is required to put imagination into reality. We have imagined before and reimagine a better Land now, hence together with understanding of the elements attached to hard work and knowing what we are doing the Land will become a better place "Pep you up break fast flakes will never make one a famous ball player." It is high time we understood the notion for us to be in motion. Always, focus yields success, negligence yields failure and faith yields grace. The world knows that The Loveliness and beauty of her endowment Bring awareness to a man Lost In thoughts as though in a hypnotic trance Her features are not stories of fancy and that when we divide ourselves everything will fade. We can live in unity let us find light as we continuously cross. MOTHER ZAMBIA ¬©Sweet Music is Amor

"While we have our eye on the future, history has an eye on us" May we always remember this.
@Agamemnon of Mycenae did you write this? Poignant and true
History looked at US, but we failed to learn from it Blinded by the future that we cannot see the present. Bask in false victories, while shirking responsibilities. Fail your allies, cooperate with bad guys. See a nation in violence, while maintaining radio silence. Saigon came and went, Afghanistan left for dead. All the while asking: 20 years for WHAT?

@Jonny Propaganda You`re incredibly ignorant. Clinton worked with a Russian despot to facilitate lies and innuendo for a dossier against Trump. Common commie tactic is to accuse your enemy of what you`re guilty of. The same goes on today. Biden is on video saying racist things, being a pederast, there`s e-mails of criminal conduct. Yet, Trump is the called the criminal, pervert, racist, etc. Classic communism. Now the world is so incredibly divided and ready to explode, all thanks to the billionaires who control large segment of the democratic and republican parties.... Trump probably included.

I get goosebumps everytime I hear this. Her vibe is so positive. And I‚Äôve memorized most of it, it‚Äôs words still give me goosebumps every 200th time.
While the poem is good and the poet good if misguided. She is speaking for a fake president put in power by the very forces she speaks again and the party that put her people in chains in the past and intends to keep them there mentally into the future. It is hard that someone this educated can not open her mind to see this. But God, please spare us from those indoctrinated from lies from the masters of gaslighting.
Step aside Joseph Goebbels, watch a pro do it.

Watching Gorman's recitation of her poem in January, I was impressed by her poise but, as I expected, underwhelmed by her poem; occasional poems are notoriously difficult to write well, since the writer is obligated to serve the occasion, not her imagination. However, what astonished me was the near-universal approbation the poem received, including in normally serious quarters, such as the New York Times. Now that the poem has been published in book form, the critic William Logan has taken it on (in The New Criterion). Logan's reviews are famously biting, and I would not have expected him to admire the poem. Still, his criticisms are so exactly on point that (in a mainly losing battle, no doubt, to encourage people to rethink whether Gorman's work is truly serious and memorable as poetry), I can't help but quote a few of them here: "That the country was moved [by the poem] is a reminder of how poorly poetry is taught, where it is taught at all. . . [H]er poem was a sorry affair, composed of stock metaphors and dreary banalities, with the rhymes of a breakfast-cereal jingle and the heart of a stockbroker." "Gorman indulged in excruciating puns and game-show-host wordplay ('We lay down our arms / So that we can reach our arms out,' 'the norms and notions of what "just is" / Isn‚Äôt always justice,' and, even worse, 'We seek harm to none, and harmony for all'). The text was also full of Sphinx-like riddles to make a reader of poetry wince. 'And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. / Somehow, we do it.' Do what, exactly? (And shouldn‚Äôt that be 'was ours'?) The fragmentary sentences don‚Äôt help. In the opening, she‚Äôd written, 'The loss we carry, a sea we must wade.' She may have intended that the shard be governed by the previous sentence, which began, 'Where can we find . . . ?'‚Äîbut 'Where can we find the loss we carry, a sea we must wade?' doesn‚Äôt make sense. Or is the sea the loss we carry? Not even the Colossus of Rhodes or Paul Bunyan could wade a sea. Elsewhere, '. . . That is the promised glade, / The hill we climb, if only we dare it: / Because being American is more than a pride we inherit‚Äî / It‚Äôs the past we step into, and how we repair it.' The promised glade? Really? A glade is an open space in a forest, so not usually something you can climb. And why are 'we' daring the hill? (She should have said, 'dare to,' but she needed a rhyme on 'inherit.') Finally, the past can‚Äôt be repaired‚Äîonly its mistakes." "No one expects a poet of limited rhetorical gifts and a taste for timeless drivel to write a masterpiece. Gorman was only twenty-two, and perhaps she‚Äôll be more than a nine days‚Äô wonder. . . . [T]his 'keepsake' edition of the inaugural poem ought to embarrass poets, readers, and the famous Washington dead."
I am still in love with this poem

The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn‚Äôt always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time Then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade But in all the bridges we‚Äôve made That is the promised glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it
‚ÄûDer H√ºgel, den wir erklimmen‚Äú von Amanda Gorman Mr. President, Dr. Biden, Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, B√ºrger Amerikas und der ganzen Welt, Wenn es Tag wird, fragen wir uns, wo wir Licht zu finden verm√∂gen, in diesem niemals endenden Schatten? Den Verlust, den wir tragen, ein Meer, das wir durchwaten m√ºssen. Wir haben dem Bauch der Bestie getrotzt. Wir haben gelernt, dass Ruhe nicht immer Frieden bedeutet. Und dass die Normen und Vorstellungen von dem, was gerade ist, nicht immer Gerechtigkeit sind. [Die √úbersetzung k√∂nnte auch lauten, ‚Äûdass die Normen und Vorstellungen von dem, was gerecht ist‚Äú. Die Betonung legt aber die obige Interpretation nahe. Wahrscheinlich spielt die Lyrikerin hier aber bewusst mit der doppelten Bedeutung von ‚Äûjust‚Äú. Anm.d.√úbersetzer] Und doch geh√∂rt die Morgend√§mmerung uns, noch ehe wir es wussten. Irgendwie schaffen wir es. Irgendwie haben wir es √ºberstanden und bezeugten eine Nation, die nicht kaputt ist, sondern einfach unvollendet. Wir, die Nachfahren eines Landes und einer Zeit, in der ein d√ºnnes, schwarzes M√§dchen, das von Sklaven abstammt und von einer alleinerziehenden Mutter gro√ügezogen wurde, davon tr√§umen kann, Pr√§sidentin zu werden, nur um sich selbst in einer Situation zu finden, in der sie f√ºr einen vortr√§gt. Und ja, wir sind alles andere als lupenrein, alles andere als makellos, aber das bedeutet nicht, dass wir danach streben, eine Gemeinschaft zu bilden, die perfekt ist. Wir streben danach, gezielt eine Gemeinschaft zu schmieden. Ein Land zu bilden, das sich allen Kulturen, Farben, Charakteren und menschlichen Lebensverh√§ltnissen verpflichtet f√ºhlt. Und so erheben wir unseren Blick nicht auf das, was zwischen uns steht, sondern auf das, was vor uns steht. Wir schlie√üen die Kluft, weil wir wissen, dass wir, um unsere Zukunft an erste Stelle zu setzen, zuerst unsere Unterschiede beiseitelegen m√ºssen. Wir legen unsere Waffen nieder, damit wir unsere Arme nach einander ausstrecken k√∂nnen. Wir wollen Schaden f√ºr keinen und Harmonie f√ºr alle. Lasst die Welt, wenn sonst auch nichts, sagen, dass dies wahr ist: Dass wir, selbst als wir trauerten, wuchsen Dass wir, selbst als wir Schmerzen litten, hofften Dass wir, selbst als wir erm√ºdeten, es weiter versucht haben Dass wir f√ºr immer verbunden sein werden, siegreich Nicht weil wir nie wieder eine Niederlage erleben werden, sondern weil wir nie wieder Spaltung s√§en werden. Die Heilige Schrift sagt uns, dass wir uns vorstellen sollen, dass jeder unter seinem eigenen Weinstock und Feigenbaum sitzen soll und keiner ihnen Angst machen soll. Falls wir unserer eigenen Zeit gerecht werden sollen, dann wird der Sieg nicht in der Klinge liegen, sondern in all den Br√ºcken, die wir gebaut haben. Das ist das Versprechen: Der H√ºgel, den wir erklimmen, wenn wir es nur wagen, denn Amerikaner zu sein, ist mehr als ein Stolz, den wir erben, es ist die Vergangenheit, in die wir treten, und die Art, wie wir sie reparieren. Wir haben eine Macht gesehen, die unsere Nation eher zerschlagen w√ºrde, als sie zu teilen, die unser Land zerst√∂ren w√ºrde, wenn es dazu f√ºhre, Demokratie zu verz√∂gern. Und dieser Versuch war fast erfolgreich. Doch auch wenn Demokratie von Zeit zu Zeit verz√∂gert werden kann, kann sie niemals dauerhaft besiegt werden. In diese Wahrheit, in diesem Glauben, vertrauen wir. Denn obwohl wir unsere Augen auf die Zukunft richten, die Geschichte hat ihre Augen auf uns gerichtet. Dies ist die √Ñra gerechter Wiedergutmachung. Wir f√ºrchteten zu Beginn, wir f√ºhlten uns nicht bereit, Erben einer solch schrecklichen Stunde zu sein, doch in ihr fanden wir die Kraft ein neues Kapitel zu schreiben, uns selbst Hoffnung und Lachen zu schenken. Also w√§hrend wir uns einst fragten, wie wir jemals diese Katastrophe √ºberstehen k√∂nnten, stellen wir jetzt fest: Wie k√∂nnte eine Katastrophe jemals uns √ºberstehen. Wir werden nicht zur√ºck zu dem marschieren, was war, sondern uns auf das zu bewegen, was sein wird. Ein Land, das zwar verletzt, aber dennoch intakt ist, g√ºtig, aber k√ºhn, k√§mpferisch und frei. Wir werden uns nicht umdrehen oder durch Einsch√ºchterung unterbrechen lassen, weil wir wissen, dass unsere Unt√§tigkeit und Tr√§gheit unser Erbe f√ºr die n√§chste Generation sein wird. Unsere groben Fehler werden zu ihren Lasten. Aber eines ist sicher: Wenn wir Barmherzigkeit mit Macht verschmelzen und Macht mit Recht, dann wird Liebe unser Verm√§chtnis und Ver√§nderung das Geburtsrecht unserer Kinder. Also lasst uns ein Land hinterlassen, das besser ist als das, welches uns hinterlassen wurde. Mit jedem Atemzug aus meiner bronzegegossenen Brust werden wir diese verwundete Welt in eine wundersame verwandeln. Wir werden uns von den goldbeschienenen H√ºgeln des Westens erheben, wir werden uns aus dem windgepeitschten Nordosten erheben, in dem unsere Vorfahren zum ersten Mal die Revolution verwirklichten, wir werden uns aus den von Seen ges√§umten St√§dten des Mittleren Westens erheben, wir werden uns aus dem sonnengebrannten S√ºden erheben, wir werden wieder aufbauen, uns vers√∂hnen und erholen, und jeden bekannten Winkel unserer Nation und jede Ecke, die unser Landes genannt wird. Unser Volk, vielf√§ltig und sch√∂n, wird aufstreben, zerschunden und sch√∂n. Wenn der Tag kommt, treten wir aus dem Schatten heraus, entflammt und ohne Angst. Die neue Morgend√§mmerung erbl√ºht, wenn wir sie befreien. Denn es gibt immer Licht, wenn wir nur mutig genug sind, es zu sehen, wenn wir nur mutig genug sind, es zu sein.
The oppressed woman who only received a $43,000 per year 1 - 12 year private school education. The poor thing ! And She also suffered through a Harvard College. Oh and education debt ? Her education cradle to grave was paid for by others.
this mans don't know what oppression means
She forgot to do the air quotes around ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù Biden. The air quotes are mandated by those of use who have read her ‚ÄúDissertation.‚Äù
I think the message was beautiful, but for me the poem was average at best. Before anyone attacks me, I too am a POC woman, so that rules out me being racist or sexist. I write too and analyze poetry, and for me this wasn't it. However, I am very proud that she delivered such a great performance here and on such a momentous occasion.
Beautiful üëèüèøü•∞üëçüèΩ
Al I can think is trump 2024 I cant wait to 2024 to let formal president Trump Lead the country to the top And think about only one color We the people of the United States of America
Who else is here for a school project ‚¨áÔ∏è
Tuff i had to write a essay on this i wrote what ever tbh
How many dead stuffed ballots did it take to put the Biden mafia in power?
none because that's how unpopular Trump was üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ keep overdosing in that copium Maga Manchild ! ! ! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This highly overrated "skinny black girl" and her team wouldn¬¥t even allow a white person in the Netherlands to translate her ridiculous poem of wokeness.
This isn't even a poem wtf
Niqqa
Spoiler alert: Biden sniffed her hair
I'm young, in my teens, but I'm staying with the GOP.

Just goes to show, anything rhymes if you nod and smile
I can‚Äôt even write an acrostic poem bye üò≠‚úåÔ∏è
So Powerful!!
Hello there, I find it really odd replying to your comments here because I don‚Äôt usually chat with fans but I want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here . I realized how much you like and follow my channel. Thank you!!
so sick how media/democrats attempt to elevate blacks into being something that they are not and will never be.
source?
How come the first black president and the first female black asian VP were democrat. How come most of the black and Asian/hispanic congress members and senators are democrats.
any evidence for your claim?
Disgraceful
@Larry C Indeed anyone linked with politics has a bad image for life
@_Bionic_Frog_ I don‚Äôt think the young girl is a disgrace. It‚Äôs a disgrace that she did this speech in front of the most corrupt people in the world
You‚Äôre the disgrace Larry C
How used and disposed of do you feel now
This was incredible. Loved it.
Thank you having subtitles
Didnt even rhyme though
It doesn‚Äôt need too
My grandma sent this to my
Slam poetry is the death of art.
Sometimes we need the young to remind us to NEVER stop dreaming, beautiful.
Reminds me of the Poem by Data that he wrote about Spot, his Cat.
People actually make money off being a poet? Lol
Sutra sanghata: a 4_sentence verse,if taught continuously,will destroy all karma,attain the result of completion

she gave me photography hw and im not gonna do it hahahahah
Good things take hard work...take discipline and persistent...
She is GLOWING.
I do not know what is worse: this stupid speech or the people who pretend that it is wonderful just to virtue signal. It seems we do have only low expectations of people. I blame the school system for that.
?????????? üòê
Roses are red, violets are blue.
Joe biden I love üíò you ‚ù§‚ô•üíï so much and good to have you
Really? Give me a break.
Your poetry can‚Äôt change no man. What a coward attack in NY.
What? NY?
Wasnt Robert Frost an American poet?
YouTube please stop scrubbing my dislikes from Joe Biden videos
When I hear the sentence "...because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation .." I think of the fact that the USA is the only country in the world who has not ratified the UN Charta on the rights of the child ( #ratifycrc ) - and is one of the few countries in the modern world that does not ban child corporal punishment legally. This is unthinkable almost everywhere in Europe ...
People who dislike are people who got homework
I like Amanda Gorman's Poems.
I'm glad you like it.
me too
Do we really need racist poems read at inaugurations? America has lowered the bar from Robert Frost to this.
how is this racist LMAO
Woahhhh the subtitles are so accurate!!!!
Everything about her screams LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME. ME ME ME ME ME ME!
it's almost like that's the point of using a microphone and giving a speech in front of a crowd
This poem was in the words of j j from good times dynamite.
Guh. Are these things always about hating the previous guy?
lol
She has very little talent and too much ego.
confidence isn't an ego, michael
Her poems are beautiful üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàü•∞
Thanks for the awesome new gas prices commie joe.
@Alien POV i guess that makes sense. i grew up in a poor family so i kinda understand how pricing and stuff affects people but we never really had a car so it really never came to mind. but honestly biden's been causing a lot worse recently. he's not a hero he's just slightly less evil than trump.
@meggiesaurus No that of course is not my biggest worry, but it is a symptom of a much larger illness. That increase in price affects many people financially, It may not be anything to you, It is to many.
everything going on in this country and gas prices are what you're worried about?
@_Bionic_Frog_ you're obviously a kid because the gas price is legitimately awful rn
Cry
Good job
MUST WATCH...8 yr old JAYA WINN perform ENTIRE poem in honor of AMANDA GORMAN.....
"We've learned that quiet isn't always peace."
What a c u n t
someone's mad. boohoo white guy there's worse problems in the world than you getting your feelings hurt. and type it with your whole chest next time.
How black you are
WELL THIS YOUNG LADY WILL REGRET DOING THIS IN HER LIFETIME üñï
No.
why
This is not poetry.
the only thing worse than this poem is implanting a victim mindset in an american child and exploiting her to fuel your divisive, destructive and deadly democrat seeded race war.
this poem sucks
Bruh all these people degrading her in the comment section are making me lose brain cells
Mediocre poetry. But this is hailed as wonderful. Gee, I wonder why?
Racist.
how is that racism
@J M J Source?
@Cohen Harrison If I found that translators of my poem were judged by the color of their skin and I didn‚Äôt speak up I‚Äôd be a racist too.
Did McDonald's sponsor her outfit for this
Let's unite but you can't translate my poem unless you have my skin. Disgusting. Can we be honest and admit we are creating a recipe for disaster in for the next generation.
Amanda Smollet
such a boring and under delivered speech. I felt really annoyed by the whole ordeal. She tried so hard to be the next mlk.. but to be honest... I don't think she was moving at all.
the Steep Slope that we Tumble Down (retruthed poetry) When dark comes, we ask ourselves : where could we even find light in this never-ending shame ? The loss we carry, a void we must make. We are the belly of the beast. We have to learn man‚Äôs peace is not true And man‚Äôs justice is ajustice And the nothing will soon be ours We ignorant Man stupid proud nullos Scripture tells us USA is to be destroyed because they abandon God‚Äôs fear They dare to resist God and the steep slope they surely tumble DOWN GOD WILL END FOR EVER DEMOCRACY Democracy = nothing, people unable to govern themselves, unable to choose rightly. Democracy MUST be destroyed for ever. God listens only those who obey Him As Cumberland plateau is deserted so all their Union is to be it. It will! And after USA all nations. Don‚Äôt do the clevers !!!!!!!! Signed : someone somewhere sometime
but this is a speech, not a poem
I don‚Äôt hear the beat
Her flow go crazyüò≥
She makes more sense than Shakespeare
Maybe because you understand the context and ordinary language.
Too bad she is racist, because she is too young.
@Z Floyd cool good for her
@meggiesaurus she disallowed white people from translating her poem.
she's not racist. stop using words you can't understand.
Ami torna a scuola la longo interroga
She ain't no Martin Luther King, Jr.
keeps saying descendant of slaves but she is not.
oh really? you've collected a sample of her dna, lab tested it and everything?
The speech is not about her.
‚ÄúLet us leave behind a country better then the one we were left with‚Äù ü§£ it‚Äôs been less then 2 months and you already f#%ked that up.
What an oversentimental linguistically low-level load of rubbish clich√©s.

I honestly can‚Äôt believe people like this mediocre college campus coffee house crap.
Dr. Seuss wrote better poetry.
üòÇüòÇ man am sure you all like/love the poem but just dislike the video because of the homework üòÇ (I hate the homework too )
Lmfao this was absolute *GARBAGE* cringe ü§£ "just-IS isn't justice" LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
@Quinn T Buggy I'm your father.
Like this
I love the irony of a african american making this speach about oppression for the inauguration of a man whos policies put millions in jail. Who is in the same party that fought to keep slaves, fought against civil rights. The same man who said he doesn't want his kids growing up in a racial jungle. Or that Obama was the first articulate black man, that the black community is full of super predators, if you don't vote for me then you ain't black, and many more.
And where is the rhymes if it is called poetry?
@Mia Seligman oh really? So better to wright blank verse (free verse) my dear if "poet" couldn't do rhymes. U better open wiki to find definition of poem and then u could text something here.
Lmao poems dont have to rhyme my guy
Her metric really sucks...
I love Allah
This was ineffable
Cornballish üëé
Blah blah blah.
How many lies inside this embarassing speech...
@Rick74 politically correct is the key
Explain.
Liberals are weird.
you really wanna die on this hill after you actively supported donald trump of all people?
@Quinn T Buggy Thanks for proving my point!
Wtf?
is famous because she's black
No.
What a hollow poem. A bunch a platitudes.
This is propaganda. Biden/Harris are neoliberals. Min wage raise rejected. Covid package reduced. The poem is unctuous rubbish.
@Super Fantastic Top 10 in French ‚Äúen suite‚Äù is actually ‚Äúensuite‚Äù
@Super Fantastic Top 10 There is nothing to win. The only thing you gained is arrogance as you weren‚Äôt willing to educate yourself and actually learn a little on the French language. Technically laisser-faire is also correct as it is the infinitive form pronounced identically derived from french and sharing the same meaning. It could be spelled both ways and mean the same thing. Laissez-faire is the imperative form and laisser-faire is infinitive. Here‚Äôs your cup champion üèÜ üòö
@_Bionic_Frog_ "laissez faire" is correct in English usage, as is "en suite", "cul-de-sac" and other expressions, whether or not they are used exactly like this in French. Your attempted "correction" was therefore WRONG. I win.
@Super Fantastic Top 10 Literally was autocorrect because I had spelled it wrong once before ü§´ but as a French-Canadian I can confirm that laissez-faire is from french origins as it means ‚Äúabandon‚Äù ‚Äúlet go‚Äù or ‚Äúseize‚Äù doing. No need to lecture me about my language American boy.
@_Bionic_Frog_ We use the phrase "laissez faire" in English. I'm right. You're wrong. You also spelled "literally" wrong. If you're going to patronise people, at least do it well, as a literate adult, without basic spelling mistakes. üòâ
@Super Fantastic Top 10 indeed it is a ‚Äúz‚Äù but that‚Äôs just the term because proper French would be laisser faire. Also, I don‚Äôt see how the Covid package could be reduced if Trump did LITTERALY nothing about it and just denied the pandemic.
@_Bionic_Frog_ laissez faire. Look it up
@Super Fantastic Top 10 actually it‚Äôs ‚Äúlaisser faire‚Äù because with a ‚Äúz‚Äù it would be conjugated. üòâ
@Rick74 you spelled "laissez-faire" wrong. And "economists". No, "neoliberal" is not a synonym for "libertarian", although there is some overlap. Learn to write something approaching a correct English sentence and then you may lecture me on what is "laughable". üñï
Neoliberals is a term for laissez fair economis. What you call libeterians. You seem to have no understanding of the concepts of the terms you use. That is laughable to an academic.
She could run as president tbh
We still ain't got a black James Bond... just saying.
Overhyped
this poem sucks
Great googly moogly
Um there is no Dr. Biden. Ms. Biden is an english teacher. Dr. Biden dnt see pts.
@Rick74 well said.
I know you don't have an MD, or seem to have an understanding of how higher education works, but a Master Degree makes a person a doctor of science.
@Slims Boss it's the same they give to entertainers. Look it up. I'm not saying she don't have a doctorate.
She have a Doctorate sweetheart hence doctor Biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
... Marieke Lucas - translate stop ... not black ... Victor Obiols - translate stop... not black ... Don't get the job because you don't have the right skin color ... that's racism, isn't it? üëéüëéüëé
Basically: America is bad, and im 22 and i will fix everything
pretty much Sam, you nailed it lol
Is so good when you acheve something not because you were the best, but because of your biological characteristics
She is gorgeous and and brave üòç ‚ù§ üíó üíñ
Who else hasto write an essay about her now?
lmaoo are we all here cause of school? i guess every teacher in the world had the same idea lol
Victim victim everyone‚Äôs a victim. I‚Äôm black they‚Äôre out to get me. I‚Äôm a female they‚Äôre out to get me. AHHHHHHHH RUNNNNNN. What a way to live.
do you not know what racial injustice is or...
@Steel pulse what?
And your going to Hell for eternity what a way to live.
I've watched this a bunch of times over the past couple months. Any time I need to be uplifted. My beloved aunt just died of Covid. Thank you Amanda, once again, for helping us endure.
This is so bad it‚Äôs comical. All these clowns in the comments section praising this trash have never read real poetry.
yeah okay PAUL
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè üò¢ And now, place to the Lgbtq  martyrs poem üò¢
Love the comments form all the Trump supporters who would rather hear Trump telling people to inject bleech into their veins and end with "God bless the United sush!"
Trump never told people to inject bleach. That is a media lie.
And in the meantime, refuse to have her poem translated by white people . THE IRONY
@Airborne82 You're using internet, which is notorious for being brought by occidental civ/a.k.a whites. Thus I feel offended than any other person being anything else than white would even dare to answer me here. See how dumb that sounds ?
You misspelled ‚Äúactivist‚Äù
"self righteous partisan idealogue"
You gave me homework
Hey to all yall pointing out the obvious BS and great acting by a race charlatan... Y'all better be careful, this is #BLMUSA even Jake from state farm is not allowed to be white anymore üíØüíØüíØüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
She stole the show. I remember just about nothing about the inaguration but her poem.
lol, you can spew anything and call it poetry nowadays as long as you play the race card
THIS AMAZING! I LOVE THIS! This is something I will listen to it everyday.üòòüòÅ
So like what make this so ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. Im no poet so can someone breakdown her art
@radu bradu chill buddy
@Eddy Love did you even vote?
@Î∞ïÏ£ºÌòï lmaooo you a clown
@radu bradu she mentions her race in a handful of lines out of dozens and dozens of others, but nice bait
lol, "art", you mean the art of playing the race card?
jut kann mir mal einer sagen welche stilistischen mittel sie verwendet üòë hab ne hausaufgabe HAHHAH
She bores me up...
Homegirl didn't create a poem, she created a sermon.
@Mark Mandel Word.
It was both. Poems don't have to rhyme.
To bad her call for no division isn't being honored by those who put her on the stage.
Someone put a beat on dis ?
She does know he is a racist right?
Why did she write a poem for a senile racist
@oyra2206 Biden has said sone very racist things.
"Senile racist"?? no, that was Trump.
DRIVEL.
We were forced to watch this in English class and then, do some boring poetry assignment on this
Look creepy Joe cocoa butter and hair grease go sniff
I think nobody will outperform Maya.
Overrated. That doesn't even sound very poetic ? Or maybe its because I'm not american ü§î
@KM I watched this video because everybody was talking about it : I watched it for culture. I indeed feel like I wasted my time, but why are you insulting me ? You seems like someone who only care about what's happening in their country, that's kinda stupid since all countries are connected and what happends in one can have influence on the whole world...
If you're not an American, do you enjoy watching this video? What a waste of time you are. Hahahaha well you are not worth anything.
@Ernesto And, anti-white. That's why she was put there.
She's anti American.
It's called a sermon, not a poem.
How much money did black communities get from the 90 million dollars donated to BLM
90 million dollars to combat police brutality. Are you stupid?
pathetic.just a PR stunt
Overrated. Poem is cliched. Pastiche written all over it.
What's the fuss about her ? A pretty boring delivery ....
Being a skinny black girl, descended from slaves is meaningless in 2021. You don't get any extra points or points taken away for those things. Being raised by a single parent is a difficulty that is hard to overcome.
Why y'all mad? You can't get sympathy or fame by being honest, need to lie, be extra dramatic and definetly do what's trending and make yourself a big ol victim n if youre a real professional at this.... YOU BETTER PULL THE RACE CARD! Why yall mad, she did her job right 100%
Not about scoring points. Simply stating facts. But of course you'd skew it however you like to... Well, score points.
Blame the government for incentives to be a single mom..
@Cannibal Lee Right, Poems don't come with bios.
And...? Does It make her a good poetress, writer or artist? Il don't think so.
She goes from inauguration poet to common liar like Jesse Smollett in less than 60 days.
This is poetry? Lol
No
Wtf is that crap on her head?
It's called a headband. Girls and women often wear them as fashion accessories.
The Democrats and their fellow travelers always have the same message: this country's a failure.
No, this country is unfinished
SOROS DOLL!
Welcome world to another great poet ascending great steps.
She probably didn't even write it herself.
@Gary Sheldon Jr How do you like these gas prices, Biden boy?
@Liberal Voters Against Biden You not funny you sound stupid play that game with someone else.
@Gary Sheldon Jr Nice grammar bro. Did you even complete 3rd grade? I doubt it.
How do you know was you there? No you wasn‚Äôt.
Whatever man
I‚Äôm sorry but this doesn‚Äôt sound like poetry, it just sounds like someone giving a speech. Now I know that not all poetry is supposed to rhyme(I did take literature and English classes) but if a politician stood at this same podium and read these same words, nobody would call it poetry. She would make an excellent speech writer.
If you don‚Äôt get it, you don‚Äôt get it , that‚Äôs all
So many people don‚Äôt understand poetry and it shows in these comments
Oh, the DRAMA ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è
YAWN ofcourse those folks always want to act like victims Trump 2024
This poem should be backed by Michael Jacksons "We Are the World". I come from a multi racial family of different adopted siblings my parents surrounded me with and has taught me beauty and unity comes from diversity. Assimilate to a rainbow, everyone loves looking into the sky after a rain shower to see a rainbow. Rainbows aren't just made of black and white, its made of millions of different hues and shades. The world is made of many people and cultures,. Im not tryna sound like a hippie but it is just that. We need to get it together because if we don't as a world come together as this powerful young women has said, we deserve to be left in the dust. I hope this gjrl moves mountains for the rest of her life because she's doing just that, now! Inspiring, raw, honest and beautiful is how i would describe her speech. She is what Martin Luther King stood for and wanted for our country and for the world. You go girl üí™
And still no acceptable healthcare plan. This nation is a failure.
@soup I know, saying we have no healthcare plan Love Juice approves of so the country is a failure is pretty dumb, IMAO.
@Out of Compliance that was so ignorant lmao
@Schniedel Mief Wait, let me get a magnifying glass and tweezers first.
@Out of Compliance open my pants, go to work. Problem solved
Get a job and pay for healthcare. There you go, problem solved.
Now playing the race card
I still cry when I listen to your poem . Wow
She is giving me Iyanla Vanzant vibes

SHE GAVE ME A 5 PARAGRAPH ESSAY
BIGGEST ELECTION FRAUD IN HISTORY OF THE USA...TRUMP IS THE TRUE PRESIDENT OF THE USA...STOP THE STEAL!!!
saying that will probably trigger her PTSD.
Yea yea whatever only fraud when you lose grow up this is democracy. Oh wait Trump and his base don‚Äôt know what democracy is.
Mediocre at best. And her poem is based in lies which makes it hollow and naive. How sad. I'd like to see her do a poem based in some objective truth.

If you're so committed to equality for all people of all races, then why did you fire your dutch translator because she wasn't black???? - that's actually the definition of racism. This is the exact reason the mass majority of people in the world do not believe a single thing the MSM and government agenda is pushing it's all bs to divide us EVEN MORE. Divide and conquer RIGHT??? News Flash - we don't buy the evil racist fascist bs you're selling. You can try and trick the world for a long time, but that time is up. #THEREALTIMEISUP
Every thing she said are obvious truths that are overly dramatized and excessively articulated. Three quarters of that crowd probably stopped following her after twenty five seconds. There are a lot of much more talented poets in the US, it‚Äôs just that they aren‚Äôt a black girl.
2.8 million views üëèüèΩüëèüèΩ What a wonderful poem ‚ú®
It's garbage.
Bruh i got a week of homework from her
is this a hamilton based poem? lol
Im shocked to see a young black woman with a victim complex....üòí
Actually Democracy has been defeated historically and by gods will it wont destroy Americas Republic üòé
Haha looser
Nice poem, Racist woman
From all the praise she was getting I was really expecting this to be something... more. This is some highschool tier trash
@Andrew Petro it is thanks for noticing Do you think I look good?
@Ayden Berg is that a selfie in your profile pic ?
@Dylan Scott NP Mate cya later
@Ayden Berg oh, art is subjective? Okay I will make sure to keep quiet about my opinions then, thanks
Poetry is an art form Art is subjective But could you do something better that makes everyone happy?
This poster black child
Disgusting activism. Very dangerous person. God save America. This is version, or beginning, of communistic terror. We know it very well, from fifties.
Yeah, because old communist regimes are known for their commitment to cultural and ethnic diversity. üôÑ That's why the Holodomor occurred- Stalin was an SJW for the human rights and dignity of the Ukrainian people.
I am also a poet. Of course, I'm not worthy to even be compared to the great Amanda Gorman. Her poetic genius is earth-shaking and beyond anything I could ever hope to write myself. Here is a modest little offering of my poetry: I reminisced of a time long ago when I was only twenty years old. I was studying English 101 at the University Of British Columbia in the summer of Eighty-Four. It was at a summer session because I had failed English 101 two years before. A failure due more to my citizenship in a different realm than to the failings of my intellect, aptitude, or the magnanimity of my core. ‚ÄúYou have such a poignant and evocative writing style,‚Äù wrote my teacher on the short story I had submitted the week before. I had written about a lonely sojourn on a desolate beach in the pregnant moment, When sunset injures day's abandon and grants night the freedom to roam. I had written about the mighty North Shore mountains, Hoary with age and reverberating with an energy ineffable to the mind, But savored by the soul. I remembered how exhausting of mind, but above all of the soul, writing that short-story had been. I tried to reveal my spirit bare and exposed. I tried to destroy the ramparts and blow open the heavy gates shielding my secretive core. But through my exhausting efforts, I had only succeeded in weakening the facade between me and the world, Usually held at arm's length, But through my story then, only slightly nearer yet still remote. There is an essence within everyone hidden in a chamber far beneath the veneer that encrusts our core. We seldom allow it expression beyond just its fractured shadows dancing on an external wall. But if we all dig deep and reach into this secretive chamber, We will, to our astonishment, discover we are all reaching into the same chamber, Not a separate one for each within the all. And then we will grasp each other's same-hand. We all share the same soul. I knew that in the novel of my compulsion I would have to expose this chamber, Ramparts and heavy gates destroyed once and for all. And my novel would then cry out from this collective chamber, And speak for my left and for my right with one voice for all. It would be the ineffable ground of being reaching out to humanity from the navel of Creation, Proclaiming the dawn of a Third Age. It would announce the sunset of the Second Age before this coming dawn. A moment pregnant with change that will forever be remembered in the annals of the Civilization of Man. It would herald a paradigm shift far greater than the Renaissance, Not just an age of reason, but of reason and divinity intertwined as an inseparable whole. I envision the Third Age to be promoting the two primordial dancers, The abstract magical, and the other, its complementary whole. To engage in the Dance and thence unshard into the Eternal Garden from whence we all came forth. They are in Eternity entwined but sharded into the realms of space and time. They are shards of the divine. Would composing such a novel be an arduous journey, Exhausting my body and above all my core? Would I be as a drowning man, Gasping for breath, Kicking and screaming while with futility grasping for shore? But would every paragraph and page exhaust me, Yet also leave me yearning for more? It would, I am sure. This arduous compulsion will also uplift and invigorate me with waves of catharsis and frisson. And I pray dearly for the same in my reader, of soul-piercing joy. If I fail to evoke the same in my audience then I would have failed to breach the ramparts and the gates shielding my innermost chamber, Our collective soul. Only within this innermost shared sanctum can I truly touch someone's soul. And by touching one, I will be touching them all.
She looks good in those Chinese flag colors
The republican party looks good in the same color as the Chinese flag.
@olds Aurora You sound immature. I don't think you understand American politics at all. Waste of my time. I doubt you even vote.
@olds Aurora u right u right Canada's better
@madeleine maxwell yes because the america she describes don't exist. I turn. On news. It's yelling ,name calling and lies. Congressman bash each other. Start wars. Rob the american people. Blind.
You don't actually believe Amanda Gorman wore a yellow jacket and red headband because she secretly/openly loves the Chinese Government do you? Have you ever heard her say anything positive (or negative) about China at all? Maybe just listen to what she actually said. She only spoke about America and what we can achieve together.
@Ayden Berg so you agree. She's dressed in Chinese colors. Not the red white and blue colors of America. You sound dumb. America ain't canada.
She does look good in the Spanish or Macedonian flag colors. If we include the white then we can see Poland or Canadian flag colors. If she was going for symbolizing the Chinese flag I would have expected the coat to be red and the thing in her hair yellow. So shut up
So just read that Amanda Gorman done a request that the translator should like to be a younger and preferably colored woman to translate her poem to danish and in the Netherlands have chosen Marieke Lucas Rijneveld to translate but a colored women Janice Deul criticized the election of a white person, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld chosen to withdraw. So colored are racists, maybe even more then white, did not see that coming.
Key word is "skinny". She is happy she is not fat.
This is not poetry
@Nicholas Tait yea sure you did buddy.
@Gary Sheldon Jr I'll have you know I've memorised the whole of Eliot's Four Quartets, and you can't even construct a short sentence.
Then you don‚Äôt know poetry is.
very cool, good message but i'm also here for school
Really, a poem consisting of platitudes and cliches?
Mmmmm.... much theatrics, very woke..
üëå awesome, bravo üëè
I could listen to her read out my maths questions from my textbook and I would still be mesmerised by her voice.
It is all fun and games until you realize you now have homework due today

thank you for english homework queen!
How much was dumped in her bank account
10,000 ;)
Recited Beautifully
Isn‚Äôt it insane that Democrats can spend almost an entire year attacking Americans  burning down their cities, then act like it didn‚Äôt actually happen?!?!? It‚Äôs effing weird!!!!
thanks for the homework
And this is poetry? English language sounds so limited for poetic structure, coming from this young lady .
Love it
She‚Äôs annoying to be honest , and when she mentioned a skinny black girl raised by a single mother!! I was like damn can we have a nation that doesn‚Äôt mention color. Always have to mention your black as if we didn‚Äôt know
I hope they kept Biden away from her.

Booooo!üëéüèø
I probably don't know anything about English poetry, but this sounds to me like rap song lyrics rather than a poem. Beautiful words, but feels like it was meant to be performed in a Dr Dre album!

I got stupid homework on her
Biden wanted a Ebonics speaker for this job..
She's like a modern day Hamilton. Powerful
Imagine, even as a kurdish guy, who has never been to US, I'm deeply touched and overwoamed by these words of this beautiful, humble, golden evidence of human's ability to increase, to learn, to rise and shine! Everlasting love from Kurdistan for Amanda Gore, and everyone who led, helped and educated her....
Goes to show how indoctrinated some people are. Biden is the reason for black mass incarceration and this chick is giving him a poem
What Do people mean by she gave me.homework
Their English teacher made them recite/ analyse this poem for homework
How is watching this for homework?
I will never be able to watch this enough.
Thanks for the damn assignment
joe biden is not my president. I purposely do not capitalize his name. he does not deserve the Capitol!
You write that like anyone would care
Wow! First, Serena Williams best in tennis; Simone Biles best in gymnastics; and now Amanda Gorman best in poetry! Who's next? They put a smile on every face who watched them.
Trash
Yuck!
I‚Äôll take that as a compliment for her
She's reading from qcards
Cringe
https://youtu.be/hTwHCsTq3IU
Too many lines, the message was lost!
@A.C moron corner over here ü§£ü§£
Chill out ‚ú®
Yeah what the hell is she talking about lmao
quite embarrassing. she read it all the time. many young children can recite from memory and do not have to read their own text. I wonder if she really wrote it herself.
@Sam Schoo yeah i expected that...because you wrote about high level of education in your country...and this is it, she is product of USA low level education...
@Adam Bro≈æ nope
@Sam Schoo so you probably don't live in USA...?
@Adam Bro≈æ where I live we have one of the highest education systems in the world, still it‚Äôs very human to hold on to a card. why can‚Äôt you just let it go and give her credit for such a good speech.
@Sam Schoo well i my country even little childrens can recite without reading infront of people...diferent level of education? Probably...but this was not worthy of POTUS inauguration...
@Adam Bro≈æ This is not just ‚Äúan opinion‚Äù, you‚Äôre just straight up being rude. Of course she wrote it herself, she a poet. Let the girl have her moment. Why do people always have to be so negative? She‚Äôs standing in front of a LOT of people, maybe she wanted to have the paper in front of her so she‚Äôd feel more secure. Maybe she was so nervous she couldn‚Äôt remember. Let her be.
@Sam Schoo:)) you have problem to hear any criticts...but everebody can say his opinion...so don't be rude...
just gtfo
She gave me Italian homework
I‚Äôm here because of a English homework!!üòÇ
Understand, Trumpees? Understand?
Don¬¥t think they got her message. An IQ of at least 100 is required to get it.
Joe Biden let black children touch his leg hair.
We or learning about this grade 5
the only reason I am here is because I have English homework. But other than that very powerful poem
As good as Biden‚Äôs speech was, her speech stole the show, no doubt. Glad Biden or whoever made the decision to have a Poet Laureate.
Does she have a poem for the BLM violence thst Biden and the democrats looked the other way over last year?
@Mike Cynic What that BLM is a Marxist organisation that doesnt care about black people?
You don't get it do you?
Is it so important that teachers give you this speech as a homework? In my opinion it is not something you guys should be annoyed of. Just see this speech as a chance to understand the importance of essential life values like equality and brotherhood.
So we see all 7 thousand trump supporters who disliked the video which shouldn‚Äôt have been disliked for just speaking facts
oh boy oh boy, I sure do love the same politics I try to avoid become my homework.
Her clear skin is literally goals
Half of the comments: **praising her for being so smart.** The other half of the comments. *SHE GAVE ME HOMEWORK.*
@bob Your welcome cuckboy atleast were not bowing down to a demographic that kills over 56%
@bob Bob is literally a middle aged white guys name
@Rose HU hi dear
@dizzi 051 herab same i just wrote what ever in my essay
So true
she gave me homework tho
lol im doing it now
@bob Would a middle aged white guy be concerned about homework? Think before you type, Bob.
@dizzi 051 herab Thanks for your comment middle aged white guy.
i just listend to this 5 minute speech, still dunno what she wanted to say. Girl if you wanna say something do it ! I have to sum it up for homework i bet i can do it in 3 lines ! Honestly streching your 1 minute speech up to 5 doesen¬¥t ,make it more interseting ....
what twaddle.
yes she is great i think best speach of the day ..... loved her Superbowl spot
Be brave enough to see the light, be brave enough to be it!! Gave me the chills! ü•∂
@Eddy Love I am so sorry to hear that your Mom smoke Crack üòî.
Oh that's just a symptom from the crack you smoked
Terrible! She‚Äôs no poet she‚Äôs a hack! How embarrassing!
@oyra2206 Actually, President Trump was the only president to keep his campaign promises in decades! The worst president of them all, Obama, did nothing but lie to the American people.
Yeah, and Donald Trump was not a president, he was a hack as well.
Yeah this is a joke
‚ÄúBeing American is more than a pride we inherit... It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it.‚Äù
basically, "i'm black and I want money for free"
‚ÄúJust is isn‚Äôt always justice.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs pure cliche trash! White, black, Hispanic doesn‚Äôt matter, this was poor writing.
Kids shows
How can she stand in front of the most violent and racist party in American history who, for months, burned down cities and murdered people, while claiming they "seek harm to no one"? I'm sick of the gaslighting. Joe Biden is a racist, and his party spreads a racist, poisonous ideology. You've all been misled. It's not the right doing this. I promise with all my heart and soul. It's the left. Already there are children turning their parents in "to the authorities" to "be held accountable for dissent" against the left. the right isnt doing that. Trump never did that. You've all been used. You either comply with Democrats... or they want you suffering and dead. Biden Administration, you may trick the kids but you dont trick us who were once your henchmen. Shame on you, Democrats. Shame on you for what you've done. Shame on you for your fascist ways. Shame on you for using this young woman to spread your hate in a soft voice, to camouflage your racist ideology. You cant hide behind tokens. I know what you are. I've been there. I've seen you. WE... see you. I will never EVER comply with what you are. You tricked me once before. I will die before uniting with evil again.
She gave me homework
..a point of light in the sky of what is possible...nothing more.. nothing less

yeah but she is brave
How is she brave?
how I wish I could turn back time, spend it with loved ones and cherish what once was mine. Or to go back even more, being a kid in a candy store. How I miss the way I used
yup
Stinks!!
there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it, if only we are brave enough to be it! Truth gems!
Merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy. Love that line!!!
whats up with the captions?
I have so much to say about this election but I must first speak from my heart. This young queen had me in tears. She was so articulate, so poised so captivating yet so strong. Today marks a day that our little girls can stand with dignity, pride and hope of their future. Our little black girls have seen on today that they can be what ever they set their minds to be. Congratulations to Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman, first African American woman first Asian woman to become Vice President. I am really overwhelmed with joy and so thankful to have witnessed this amazing inauguration. WELCOME "46" We have a real President.. Thank you God for keeping them safe through the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. History has been made!
She gave me Spanish homework
She gave me homework
7.6k dislikes? y'all trippin
Probably all the kids who got homework because of her poem Or the trolls in the comment section degrading her
homie out here named reginald
This was horrible
She could be reading a recipe for chocolate chip cookies and I'd be mesmerised by her poise and tone
So we all here from English class huh?
Tick tock...tick tock... Life is counting down on your internal clock. Memories that feel as if they occurred yesterday turn to flashes of moments that seem to fade away. People you once knew walk by without a clue. The times you once shared exist as if you were never there. Years fly...friends die... and you never know when you'll say your last goodbye. Oh, how I wish I could turn back time, spend it with loved ones and cherish what once was mine. Or to go back even more, being a kid in a candy store. How I miss the way I used to feel on Christmas day when Santa was real. But back to reality...back to today, family is scarce and memories continue to fade away. Tick tock...tick tock... How I wish I could control this clock. üï∞üéØüíéThomas ‚ù§

Sounds forced
Pretty smile she has
Why nobody notices her signs of hands?? The is the satanic witch
Yo shut up
A wonderful reminder of the power of poetry. In an age where we have a thousand ways to communicate, simply standing in front of people and reciting words you've crafted is still the most potent.
She trying to rap. Average

Spoken Ever So Eloquently. Well said Poet. Poetry is my Passion I am a Poet As Well üôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è
I am a poet too! I am a 13 year old, writting a poem to my mom and dad as a gift for their aniverssary and my poem is going to talk about the essensces of love and how it is important to not drown ourselves in hate while transmiting it. Their anniversary is in 21 days and Im still defining the poem¬¥s structure and I am pretty stressed cause I have a long way but I know I can do it! Especially because Amanda inspires me a lot (in fact, my poem is inspired by "the hill we climb"!) What poem or peice are you working on?
why did you give me homework your speech was amazing tho ngl
tip click transcript and then you can just read through it
Smh I wouldn't make any poems until we have some tangible assets from us building this country. Period. Damn Biden and kamala til then, our songs and poems....dances and all are purely entertainment til then. Nothing happens with this we shall overcome energy.
Thx for the homework
communist propaganda with king of ukraine Joe Biden
This is honestly one of the best speeches I have ever heard.
She is way over-rated. Any student of acting, and any woman who hosts a talk show, news show, gives the weather or gives CNN or Fox news or commentary, could read a poem just as effectively. Any theatre actress, theatre student or woman who's used to speaking to large groups can read a poem. Many school teachers as well. Don't ya'll think it's MUCH MORE than a coincidence that Amanda Gorman is YOUNG and PRETTY? Come ON, people, if she were middle aged or obese or homely, she would NOT have been selected to read a poem at the inauguration or SB, and you stinking know it. I also have to believe that is she were WHITE, she would NOT have been selected. But these days, young, pretty, and especially black -- gets you lots of privilege. But even if AG was white, I'd STILL be saying the same thing: There is just too much hullabaloo over her. For godsake, she read a poem with passion. This is not a one-in-a-million capability. Any adolescent involved in school plays can do this.
you have a vaild point, but she is standing up for the black community not just in America but across the globe and I think thats what matters.
Wakanda forever
She speaks eloquently, just don't like her ‚úã üôÑ The only reason people are talking about her is because she was chosen to be in the inauguration. Mad funny bro
@Felix Jessup Fair, but congrats to her, she can write a piece of paper, speak It and now shes famous üëè
@Felix Jessup so does literally every 8th grader for English XD
This is poetry?
@Corn Pop The bar for art has lowered to point of a child‚Äôs finger painting being revered the same as a Rembrandt. ‚ÄúOh the emotion and the feelings in this....‚Äù lol, no. Produce something worth praise, you don‚Äôt get credit for feelings.
@Felix Jessup It sounds like someone simply talking in coherent and complete sentences. Apparently it‚Äôs considered an art form these days?
Good job
Is anyone else getting sick off all this ?
Democracy took a vacation for 4 years, but now its back...yeah sure...Amanda... sure
it did
Love her. Don‚Äôt trust Biden.
@Emily Baker why not trust him though?
@ImNeoFr dude him being better than trump doesn‚Äôt mean that he‚Äôs particularly great
Why...why shouldn‚Äôt we trust Biden...it was literally proven that trump worked with the Russians to sway the vote in 2016 and he lost the election but somehow became president. Biden has literally been running for president longer than you‚Äôve been alive and he hasn‚Äôt won since this year, if that‚Äôs not an honest man I don‚Äôt who is. Haven‚Äôt you noticed how quiet the news has been since Biden became president? Every other day there was some drama with trump but with Biden he‚Äôs in the background actually building our country back up and passing bills that will effect the future in ways we cannot imagine. The news has nothing to report on him because there isn‚Äôt anything to report in the first place he‚Äôs doing his job.
She is a rough diamont
And Biden just put as Agriculture secretary to Mr Tom "Monsanto" Vilsack, but hey you had a nice poem in the inauguration. Wake up gringos!!!!!
want to keep scrolling to see it so I took it and I'm guessing he probably stole it too
She killed it üëç‚ù§
It‚Äôs just comforting to know new born spirits start incarnating with the direct message‚Äî/LIGHT- We are the light , do not ever never forget to shine in order for all humanity shine.Thanks Amandaüåûüåçüåπ
STUNNING.
AMAZING .....
This is a bad poem.
layers upon layers of platitudes.
@Jim Katsieris go to China
Go to bed
A deliberate biased democratic political message. Hypocritical. Sounds as if the Democrats are not guilty for all their division and destruction of the country over many months. How could anyone listen to this speech and believe they have a monopoly on truth. Their actions prove they are not to be believed. I see it in this address.
Please
She is so ahead of her time. This made me cry. Her speech embodied all that is Good, Noble, Pure, Truth, Respect, Dignity, Love. üôèüíù
Is no one going to talk about the captions, "no de feed pappie koos bubel" Huh Edit - Nevermind it's just Dutch, sorry to anyone who is Dutch, I didn't know
hahaha i'm Dutchspeaking and that is some kind of phonetic translation of what she is saying, but it barely means anything in Dutch :D
Her speech and her actions say two different things.
@Milissa Schidecker your opinions are clearly influenced by religion, nothing else. The reference to ‚Äúnatural‚Äù family gives it away.
@Jim Katsieris sure
@Milissa Schidecker look up where? I go by many female friends who identify as feminists yet in no way hate men or the natural family.
@Jim Katsieris look it up, how do you think I know
@Milissa Schidecker that‚Äôs not true, come on
@Jim Katsieris Soon as she touts being a feminist it‚Äôs a wrap. Don‚Äôt you know that feminist hate men and the natural family?
Do tell?
She is a second rate poet just like Paul Lawrence Dunbar, she is a man hating feminist and a racist.
I can do better, much better. It's not that I don't appreciate her performance but I want to put it out there that it's just the matter of being at the right place at the right time.
Humble huh?
Her hand movements made me happy
You guys should check out the guy who was mistaken for a suicide bomber on this day right outside the building, just because he was wearing a cloth. Here is the link https://youtu.be/24FK6UkgwQo
Love her yellow and red , what a beautiful inspirational speech.
Thanks for being a fan, This is not an official channel , it is a private channel where I get to connect with my favorite fans religiously and privately I won't be able to reply every comments on my official channel, but I would reply every Comments without interruption on here. Once again, thanks for being a fan and God bless you!
Hello Heather
I have an homework assignment on this and it's late üòû
I was being sarcastic. But honestly if you just write about left wing ideals you'll get huge marks.
@LegendLength can someone tell me what this poem is telling us in general cuz I need help lol
Just talk about how great Biden and Democrats are. You'll get 100% mark each time.
‚òòÔ∏è WOW! That was wonderful! Such wise words. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
LOL if only the Dems believed as she does. I've been yelled over by more liberals than I can count in the past year. and I've never ever voted Republican. I have made the grave error amidst my peers of asking questions and have been 'cancelled' for it. The hypocrisy of those who consider themselves 'openminded' is something I will not forget.
I mean, I'm sorry about it, but it's not reflective of everyone who's more affiliated with the left
Your personal experiences don't reflect every liberal-
Trump cloned himself 7000 times and disliked the video
This has nothing to do with Trump. It's not true poetry and it sucks.
yeah, no. It is just bad and pure ideology.

this is so powerful and inspirational.
Black Queen Magic!! No other race can be like this. We are Magic
Black supremacist
Grace, eloquence and inspiration ... at 22.
The alliteration. The assonance. The wordplay " "Just is...Justice". This young lady is SO inspiring to SO many. I hope she handles her instant adoration well.
imho, she doesn't pause enough in order to maintain rhymes and rhythm. Sometimes she just keeps talking after a sentence is over without stopping or lowering her voice. Thus, as a non native speaker, I find it quite hard to understand when sentences start and end, though I consider my English to be decent. Also, idk if that's how most poetry is said/read in English, but it sounded like American rap to me (mainly Eminem). It is interesting because it really is different from how French poetry is read. I think it might be linked to the fact that all syllabes are pronounced at the same pace and that the pitch of the voice doesn't fluctuate¬†nearly as much in French. Therefore she reads it with a rhythm that is weird to my untrained ear in order to emphasize what sounds similar/matches in sentences that follow one another rather than stopping when people would usually stop. Ofc, there is no judgement there as I don't know anything about it, just some thoughts and observations from a naive foreigner's pov. Though¬†I can tell she must be good by browsing through the comments ^_^.
She has a speech impediment so has to deliver the words with a certain cadence to avoid stuttering
This poem will be in the History books, mark my words!
Terrible, terrible poem.
Yes it will!!!!
I've already forgotten about Greta Thunberg.
If you have a problem figuring out whether you're going to vote for me or Donald Trump then you ain't black... President Joe Biden
Go back to your own country you cheaters!!
What?
This is the great thing about literary pursuits: learning from it never ends because of people like Amanda.
The only reason people clapped was because it was finally over.
Roll over Seamus Heaney. This girl is a poetic genie!

Hello Hannah how are you doing
who else got English hw on her
3:24

; Stringing-together clich√©s isn't "poetry". At best, in a Junior-high-school English Literature class, she'd get a "D"- grade because she tuned-in her assignment. Discover the "Beat Poets", and you'll discover real, working-class, poetry.
Is this a joke... A POEM? Really... .01% of .01% of the population even cares. GET A REAL JOB
this 11 year old or 48 gave me a teams assignment

Beautiful young woman! I love what Amanda Gorman had to say through her beautiful poetry! üíê May God bless you, may God bless this world we all must live inüåé üåç
So what the big deal?
Division is what the left wants racism is prevalent but by the other race not white BLM is trying to punish whites for a crime they did not commit it was committed by others from the past . This new administration is the most racist against white people , you want peace let the past go
If you don‚Äôt like the idea of unity and everything she said you‚Äôre not a true patriotic American... see to be patriotic one must remove himself and realize that we are all in this and the main goal for many is peace equality and the same life anyone would want for themselves... why people truly believes others don‚Äôt deserve the things they feel entitled too when it‚Äôs the hands of those same people who helped them have it is insane
A powerful speech to a powerful young woman of color. Good for her. Language truly holds a power worldly power will never understand
Overrated garbage. She's just using her voice tone and sentence pauses and all the sudden she's the "it" girl. Lol
She has a speech impediment you ableist
this gives me "hope"?
she gave me english homework and its due today :(
@Arielle Legrand how is that being a hater ?

Very nice...but feels more like a speech than a poem.
Who's also here because their English teacher sent them?
me
A very special person you are,Amanda Gorman incredible speech performed so beautifully.
who else thought of Anne with an e
Amazing!!! üò≥üò≥üò≥ ... A whole poem about hope, upliftment, the strength of black ppl. Too bad she never once specifically mentions the white supremacist ideology that has fueled the Amerikkkan imperialism nightmare from its inception. Poets are supposed to channel the whole truth not half step  acquiesce in the face of persistent evil!!!ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
Ur part of the problem.. seek some help
As a Swede I have to study more english. But I get tears in my eyes, and I get very angry when I see that 7273 have disliked this (2021-01-31). How can they?
As an European I think that Amerika has never been in more mistrust of each other than now. A split nation. But I know, I have not the right to have any opinions, someone of you has told me so.
@Jimmy George OK, I shall be quiet, but we in Europe are also following this with great interest!
@Staffan Olofsson You are in Europe, not here, so you really don't have much to go on, right? We see it here clearly. Half the nation is not confident at all, and it's our nation.
@Jimmy George Sorry, I just wanted to tell that we in Europe are content that mr Biden won this election. And terrified that almost half of the american people mistrust the result. What a world are we living in?
Not everyone just walks in lockstep and praises someone because they are a certain color, as most here are doing.
It is all a lie!
So what the big deal?
This sucks
I hate poets.
@Peanut just letting you know so you are in no doubt.
Didnt ask
üíú!
Funny she has more negative thumbs then positive, she is pointless and will remain pointless. Sad skinny black girl, I bet we trace her heritage back she is a rich black Girl Just saying words.
"She has more negative thumbs than positive" Can you read numbers or- 75K compared to 7.7k 75,000 likes compared to about 7000 dislikes Are you okay? And you're mad that a Black Girl is successful? Get used to it Lea.
@Staffan Olofsson exactly, im watching this as a spaniard and it baffles my mind they think trump can still win
Sorry, you are wrong. 62000 positive, 7000 negative (20210131). And sorry there is so many dumb people in USA. Just a thought from Europe.
She will be forever forgotten in history!
She'll be remembered for decades
the amount of dislikes.. sad hateful world. but beautiful words!
She might be the next president!!
This young lady may be a future President.
"The Hill We Climb" When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn‚Äôt always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time Then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade But in all the bridges we‚Äôve made That is the promise to glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it I stole this but I didnt want to keep scrolling to see it so I took it and I'm guessing he probably stole it too
@Steve S they are still recounting in some states now, and Biden is still winning.
What a fantastic poem and young lady We climb hills every day during our lives, some easy many steep and difficult but it's how we treat others as we climb these hills that count
@Zed Dravot woah, don‚Äôt come for Lady Gaga like that broski üòüüíÖ
@Steve S Exactly. I don't like Trump anymore than Biden, but there are real problems with the integrity of our electoral system. Democrats went for years believing the baseless delusion than Russia interfered with our Elections to help Trump. That was proven to all be false, and any trolling was inconsequential compared to the massive influence of corporate dark money, the hundreds of millions from BLM donations that went into DNC coffers, and far more influential Countries like China and Israel. There was a great amount of false propaganda used against Bernie Sanders, Trump, and now any politician who tries to build a populist (non-corporatist) movement.
@N G You don't know what the word "baseless" means, or you are lying. Election fraud is a major issue in this Country, It's how Bush/Cheney won twice. It's also likely how Biden/Harris won.
If one has ever read and loved good poetry in their life, it's impossible not to be cynical about this garbage. We also live in an age where Lady Gaga is considered a special, original artist. No surprise the politically propagandized would fall for this hogwash.
@N G Our claims aren't baseless. We have questions, we got no answers. Why did they illegally change the voting laws in PA? No answer. Why did they not allow poll watchers near the ballots? No answer. Why did they put poster board on the windows in Michigan? No answer. How did a pipe burst in GA? No answer. How is there 100's if not 1,000's of people that voted from addresses that don't exist? No answer. See our claims aren't baseless. We were simply told to just move on without a single answer. If your guy lost, and these all happened against you, you'd want answers too.
thanks oikawa
@N G I don't think so bc it speaks about a force that would destroy this country if it meant delaying democracy as if denying the constitutional rights of ppl is somehow necessary or justifiable..
@N G Good to know Dominion falls under ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù according to your logic.
@R she is probable referring to Trump and Trump followers baseless claims of election fraud
R your guess is as good as mine
what does she mean by delaying democracy?
THANK U SM
@souufflee hehe ok
thank you oikawa
That was beautiful
can someone help and tell me what the general message of the poem is? iam from germany and the women speaks too fast
Damn, what a perfect example of a human being. I hope the aliens saw this one haha
@alyah marie not really tryna be funny. meant that seriously
so funny üòê
I am sorry to see so many ‚Äûdislikes‚Äú and wonder why anyone would come to this conclusion ... it does not matter wether this is technically a good poem or not ... wether this speach was held at Biden‚Äòs innauguration or not ... this is one of the best speaches I have ever heard and it will -no matter how many dislike she gets here - go down in history ... you only need to be ‚Äûbrave enough to see it‚Äú ...
It was intended to inspire and unite Americans. ‚Äú We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.‚Äù That‚Äôs when she was referring to Donald Trump.
With young people like this America has a future.
7k dislikes, really?
STOLEN ELECTION! WE WILL NOT YIELD!!
Such an annoying way of speaking. Very weird.
She has a speech impediment
This is incredible.
She is so graceful in words, gestures and presence!
Wats up with the many dislikes?..wat didn't you like about her wonderful deliverance?
3:50 is that Karl from MrBeast on the left side
Thats my homework on this :( a. Describe Gorman‚Äôs view of the past and recent past. (Mark the passages) b. Explain which passages resonate with you (that speak to you or touch you) and why. (Mark the passages) c. Study Gorman‚Äôs poem to find examples of stylistic devices and other rhetorical strategies. Explain their function within the context of the poem.
AND FOR B
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE FOR C I HAVE TO HAND IT IN IN 4 HOURS
And why is that special, if it would‚Äòve been a white boy nobody would care gahahahahahah
The fact that your fifth grade reading level doesn‚Äôt allow you to see past the color of her skin and find something significant in her words is a shame. You‚Äôd feel embarrassed if you weren‚Äôt so ignorant.
How many other qualified poets who wrote amazing poems lost out because this girl is black? She had to black political bs
famous legend, not bad for ONLY 22 years old. I like what she wore, but mostly what she spoke. Beauty came out of her mouth. She should be speaking at every State..and get paid for it
She risked her life for us all
Everyone should check out Amanda Gorman's poem promoting abortion.
abortion is healthcare. Good on her.

"There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it."
American decay with chocos in white people clothes. You digging' your grave by own hands. Cmon, spread yor ugly and morbid "democracy" inside of the country. The wider lay, the thinner is. Too many freaks you was freed from their leashes.
What was the rhyme, when Trump came? Biden bombing our kids limbs and singing the hymn - Obama drones from above, covering domestic pharma drama - - stuff? I cannot remember. üéµ All of my rhymes come from China- oh na na..... , üéµ It‚Äôs beautiful, brilliant... she is beautiful, she is brilliant... . But why put it together with this United Snakes.... all around her?
This is an amazing poem by an amazing girl!

This is why you can't have nice things America, because Meghan Markle  Obama keep pulling stupid Stunts like this....
Doctor Biden? She's not a doctor
@BORG COLECTIVE A doctorate degree is the highest level of academic degree in most fields. ... For research or university teaching, the degree is usually a PhD, while applied professional doctorates include the Doctor of Medicine (MD), the Doctor of Education (EdD), and the Juris Doctor (JD), among others.
@kelly hno i have a doctorate in software engineering That doesn't mean I gonna call myself doctor
quote: "Dr. Biden has been an educator for more than three decades. Prior to moving to Washington, D.C., she taught English at a community college in Delaware, at a public high school and at a psychiatric hospital for adolescents. Dr. Biden earned her Doctorate in Education from the University of Delaware in January of 2007. Her dissertation focused on maximizing student retention in community colleges. She also has two Master's Degrees ‚Äî both of which she earned while working and raising a family."
Australia does not have nuclear weapons, the UK and France do, both of which have significant Territories in the Pacific... When push comes to shove Australia will severe its ties with America  America will be devoured... And America won't stop pushing, both the Republicans  the Democrats... They are blowing up cities like Beirut, another Country with strong ties to France  Germany, they are running their Torture Flights with Blackwater  even bombing their own military bases in Iran... Not to mention all the planes they have shot down with Missiles or the Dictators they employ for their Torture Programs... America has fast become a global problem  they are arrogant enough to continue making themselves a problem... Especially with Meghan Markle running their fkn Country
In other words, MAGA.
In other words, STF
I'll never get poetry it's such a lame craft.
Your spoon fed mind is ready for its next scoop of irrationality
You're just hearing someone not very good at actual poetry (I studied it) - but who is very good at making political topics sound "searing" like Obama did. Speeches like these rely entirely on rhyming cadence - evangelical style. The left thinks they are atheist but all they do is create new religious rituals.
I think poetry only works if you *get* the poem. Like, I hate poetry and also think it's kinda lame, but then one day I found a poem that really struck a chord with me and it became the doctrine of how I want to live my life. Its just that one poem that I really click with, tho. Like... I still can't appreciate or be passionate about any other. So I guess you just haven't found any poems yet that resonate with you.
Thats a Good Speach!
Is she quoting "Hamilton" - the musical?
yes she is! she said that she had a speech impediment where she couldn‚Äôt say the letter ‚Äòr‚Äô, and memorising the song ‚ÄòArron burr, sir‚Äô helped her to overcome it!
I now have English work on this üòÉüî´

She gave me English work but I don‚Äôt care this is an amazing speech!

@RNB X Destinys Trinity Well after Biden, Obama, Markle  Oprah fired their latest shots at the Crown, the discussion about war on America has shifted from if it happens to when it happens.... The word of God tonight is all about "Gather Around and Haggle" Meaning the Nations are to start casting lots on who is going to hit them in the head, who is going to kick them in the Balls  who is going to cut their head off... It's no longer about preparing American communities to stand in the war that comes as pockets Of safety, but to build a pathway for American Refugees to escape the War they started...
@RNB X Destinys Trinity America has taken its old Civil War with the Crown and turned it into a World War, both Republicans  Democrats. Meghan should never have become a Duchess  Harry should never have followed her to America to launch his attacks on the Crown... The rest is Future History...
@RNB X Destinys Trinity It doesn't matter who is President, the damage Trump  Meghan Markle have done with Oprah  Obama cannot be contained America launched a world war on their Allies, both the Republicans and Democratics did it... And the Democrats have continued the FUED, as exemplified with this Oprah Girl they used at the first Ceremony of their New President... American intentions are clear, the world gets the message you have sent... Both the Republicans and the Democrats BOMBED Beirut, both the Republicans and Democratics run Blackwater Torture Flights for the CIA, so stop ya fkn Dreaming American  wake up to what your country has become
Waste of time for those who wish Biden wasn't president and would much rather have president Orange.
I told ya a Biden election was a waste of everyone's fkn time...
Dogs of war and men of hate With no cause, we don't discriminate Discovery is to be disowned Our currency is flesh and bone Hell opened up and put on sale Gather 'round and haggle For hard cash, we will lie and deceive Even our masters don't know the web we weave GATHER AROUND THIS PLACE AND HAGGLE.... CAST LOTS...
Let slip the Dogs of War... A Prophetic warning playing out  no one is willing to back down...
This is what happens when you empower DANGEROUS people Biden... You should have learned from Trumps Mistakes with Markle, Oprah  the RAAF when they blew up Beirut... Meghan  Oprah have pulled another stupid stunt that has put America in the Hot Pot... Keep going, the US isn't strong enough without it's Allies, who you continue to fkn attack...
Trump, Markle, Blackwater  the RAAF started WW3  America remains committed to the path they laid out.... End of Story...
And the ONLY WAY LEFT to deal with Markle, Erik Prince and Assad is to deal with America... Because you just wont fkn back down... Ever...
And America is going to continue attacking its own Allies, because they are too arrogant to back down from what they have fkn started with Trump, Erik Prince, the RAAF  Meghan Markle...
I hope the US is sanctioned so fkn hard over their CIA Torture Flights  Beirut Blast Crimes Against Humanity that no one from. The USA can sell anything outside US Borders...
@Charming nowhere to hide You want to sell music under Sanctions, you will have to leave America exactly as the Prophet Marcus Garvey told you...
she gave me music homework
But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust.
Mother Theresaüôèüôè
That was a Rookie Mistake Biden... Meghan Markle threatened the Queen with a Tell All Interview with Oprah, you put this Oprah Girl up on your Ceremonial stage  now a Blacklisted Documentary was leaked on YouTube as a Result of this stupid stunt...
Even Trump wouldn't pay for Meghan Markle's security  in that area he has already beaten you after you put up an Oprah-Markle girl. For your Ceremony...
Don't forget the US ally Australia's role with the RAAF  Megxit Markle threatening the Queen either...
The US has gone after Europe with Brexit  put the UK at risk of Sanctions over CIA Torture Flights  now your Exiled Megxit Duchess has launched a War in your Name against the Queen.... And you put up an Oprah girl to Read a poem at your Ceremony... The US is already at risk of Sanctions  that risk just went through the roof...
The best advice you can ever get is to have nothing to do with Oprah  Meghan Markle...
loved it
I wonder how her hair smells... Maybe Joe knows... üòÖ

Damn she is brilliant and amazing
here's a poem for you, roses are red violets are blue what about Obama telling family's in Flint Michigan their kids will be ok. here's another: the sky is blue, money is green, I lost my house, pension and retirement, but corporate America got bailed out. you are no poet, you are no Lorca or Sexton, you just signed a deal with a modeling agency, keep buying the lies and trickery, America at it's finest...
"You are no poet", she's better one than you. She has empowering sentences when you use yours to diss. Also your poem is unstructured and have no grammar or punctuation at all. You are no poet.
Notice the RACIST who gave a down thumbs - UNITED STATES üá∫üá∏ will be all Americans.

DEAR MS. AMANDA GORMAN: THE 2ND RELATED INQUIRY; HERE IS YOUR WORKING 2ND COMPANION INQUIRY AS PROMISED BY ME, THE MESSENGER THAT SPEAKS: 'WHAT IS TRUST?" God Bless ... and Have fun ...UNDER HE WHO IS "THE SON" OF GOD--NAMELY, "J.C." 1-28-2021
Mam,you gave me English homework...
This beautiful girl is the only one who deserves the right to stand and preach on that stage! Not that bunch of ignorant moron‚Äôs who call themselves patriots. These words we just heard are patriotic are the only patriotic words the world did hear in 4 years of lost time!

Once again, thanks for being a fan and God bless you!
Just a bad poem, if even a poem it's more just repetative statement's.
It's an amazing poem that speaks of the problems of recent times. Repetition is key to a poem. And she constructed a touching one whether you liked it or not. Stay Pressed.
Miss Gorman, YES! What a stunning woman! What a performance! Those words, big, bold, brave, handed to the world by this confident, talented woman is a hope of a better world in itself! I say bravo and applaud you Miss Gorman, you are going to be great, wrong, you ARE great, and you will be remembered!
Amil ist schlecht in fifa
She isn‚Äôt a Dr.
its so good i got homework now
This isn‚Äôt particularly good, neither in rhyme, meter or vocabulary. She doesn‚Äôt leave any pauses either... how can anyone focus on the contents...
@RNB X Destinys Trinity I see you must be a Liberal therefore no one is allowed to express a contradictory opinion nowadays... And to bolster your own viewpoint you put forward the Obamas??? Much mirth! Honestly, you rate the Oh bummers far too highly. You do know that virtually all of Obama‚Äôs public speeches were penned for him, don‚Äôt you? My word, if you are rating them and their intelligence‚Äô then no wonder you rated that poem so highly. I watched a documentary on that girl, that teenager (19) and let me tell, she is quite something special! However, the poem for the inauguration was not all that in MY OPINION. I speak as a poet by the way.
@Athos74oR3M hmm I see. I'm no poet. But why be so critical and strict. She's only a teenage girl. And you may not see how great of a poem that was, but the Obama did. And they have one of the best Education In the world. So if they said it was a great poem, Imma take their word for it, since they are more smart and experienced than you. But however you see this poem is how you see it
@RNB X Destinys Trinity You clearly are not a poet. It was relatively simplistic language, nothing outstanding at all and the ‚Äòpauses‚Äô if you can call them that were by no means enough. Nice sentiments and phrasing though.
The vocabulary was incredible and advanced. She wanted everyone to understand not a bunch of smart old people. She wanted EVERYONE to understand. And she had so many pauses. Yet you can't listen
She was most likely timed, and she was most likely super nervous. And it was a free verse poem, so there wasn‚Äôt meant to be any rhyme. This isn‚Äôt me saying anything referring to the political subject, but the literary work itself.
I just feel like I am listening to a rap song. No offense, what she said is certainly great but my ears are bouncing
It's poetry.
She should have recited the Lord's Prayer because that's what this country needs as it's headed down a dark path if it doesn't change its evil ways
when i was a kid in communist czechoslovakia, this kind of rubbish was called 'engaged poetry' and top commie comrades loved having it at their big events. soon the time comes when you'll be getting police visits because someone reported you for not clapping enthusiastically enough to this. good going, 'murica. you're pretty clueless about what's happening to your country.
@Peanut you're getting there. and people like you are not going to notice until it's too late :)
Except that the US is not like that, and this is just a speech
I really don't get the fascination-it's a black teenager reading.
@Charis Kampanje It's a simple reading -please stop making brilliance out of nothing.
@RNB X Destinys Trinity I agree with you. If it was a white girl-no big deal. For her you'd think they discovered William Shakespeare.
So and if a White girl did it? No one would have said What you said. No one would even have a problem. Stop hating .
She wrote it too. Show us your work.
100 times more vocabularies than Trump's longest speech... Bigly!

And the more I thing about your commentü§®ü§® the Madder I get, first of all stay in your lane, we have never heard of you little girl ,you should be glad Miss Obama even hug you, don't nobody want the virus, them mask are a hundred percent guarantee ,no she don't want her husband catching a virus ,Barack was hugging everybody he was overdoing it, so don't make it sound like you was somebody special young ladyü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î you need to slow it down until you get a real big platform of your own,to call out Michelle Obama,üòØüòØ GIRL BY
Oh shutup. She's more than you ever will be. Your acting like you are somebody when she's the one speaking on the presidents inauguration. She's successful already. Who are you? Michelle Obama knows her for hard work. That's why she don't know you. Girl bye
This female poet is a joke.
I had to come over and make a comment after watching the show the dish ü§®ü§®they brought up that this young lady said something about Miss Obama being jealous of her husband hugging herü§îü§î number one girl by ,you bout to mess up already talkin too much, don't know one care about thatü§®ü§® her husband touching you, number one she didn't want him hugging everybody because of the virus, didn't have nothing to do with you miss brokeness, so don't get it twisted ,and don't be trying to make Michelle Obama look like a black jealous woman, I can't believe they gave you a play, in the first thing you do in the interview is talk about Miss Obama, matter fact I don't even want to hear you talk no more, I don't even like poetry no way be gone ü•±ü•±ü•±
Be gone hater. You don't like poetry don't listen. Michelle Obama lives this young lady and if you are trying to speak on Michelle's behalf. She would be disappointed with you.
the lecture doesn't impress me very much.
Didnt ask
What beautiful prose and poetry! America, we're rooting for you
was a beautiful poet for a young woman of her age. but this inherent tickling in her voice makes me to anxious and its just one of those young prodigy type performances that didnt actually make an impact cause its all pathos and feel and hitting the vibe of what a youngster thinks an inauguration poem should be like.
Very little rhymed...pretty bad poem actually :(
@Franz Fuchsschwanz poems don‚Äôt have to rhyme
@MShroomii hmmm, well...still doesn't make it rhyme
It‚Äôs a free verse poem. Poems don‚Äôt have to rhyme or have a set pattern or rhythm. In fact, one of the earliest poets, Walt Whitman, wrote in a similar fashion to Amanda, and he is considered one of the greatest modern poets of our time.

Speech impediment, more like smart impediment. Because shes stupid.
Much ado about Nothing . A typical black high school senior level piece , with no reference to the greatness of this country , but constant declarations of coming out of the darkness . What , exactly ? Rule of law ? Securing our own borders ? Job creation ? Keeping us out of useless , heart rending foreign wars ? But this amorphous whining is what passes for intelligence and sensitivity in black America , and rather than empower through economic prosperity , pandering is what the Biden asphyxiation will continue to be all about .

Poem, or poetically leaning speech?
Uplifting rhetoric. Not my idea of poetry.
When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade 5 We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn't always just-ice 10 And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken 15 but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president 20 only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect 25 We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us 30 We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another 35 We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried 40 That we'll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
T
we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one 95 We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south 100 We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful 105 When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it 110 If only we're brave enough to be it
...And no one shall make them afraid If we're to live up to our own time Then victory won't lie in the blade But in all the bridges we've made That is the promise to glade 50 The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it 55 We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed 60 it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us 65 This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power 70 to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert 75 How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, 80 fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation 85 Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy 90 and change our children's birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest,

Our country is doomed when the garbage spewing out of her mouth inspires the woke culture.
Dr. Biden? what a joke
FAKE FRAUD TREASONIST BIDEN HES NOT THE PREZ
Uncle Joe would have wished her to be younger
I heard of people who cried after listening to this poem. It is a powerful poem, but the only reason that I did not cry is because I never really cry lol
What a pretenious clich√© and empty speech. Suits Biden indeed
This girl. As an old person, I celebrate a young person's need to not only be understood as a philosophical young person, but also her recognition of lives and generations before her in a poem/speech/big deal moment. She can't exactly understand all the decades before and after her, but she helps "us" to at least, *look* at *it*. A gift. I hope she goes away to another country and hunkers down for a while.
Just came across this. She is cute but I don't think abyone watched Harris/Obama inaguration.

I don't see anything special about this üòÇ. The world loves to make things more special than they are now days.... Good for her but I just see a girl speaking as any other girl saying a speech.... Her hand gestures are actually annoying...
@gojisama Just like that bernie sanders meme that everyone was posting everywhere and I didn't find funny or understand why everyone was posting it as if it was the funniest thing on earth, I don't get that either and I also asked why? And no one could give me a good reason for it either....maybe I just don't find most things to be funny like the majority of people....who knows....
@gojisama She might have to you and alot of people and that's fine. I just thought it was ok nothing great but that's just my opinion and that's no knock on her as a person.... just my observation. Good for her! I'm just an honest guy and don't mean to hurt anyone, when I see something I don't understand I always ask why. Maybe it's a bad thing because people can take it the wrong way but it's never to be malicious to anyone.
@TheMusikryder I get what you mean and I can see your comment was from a place of observation! But I dunno I feel like Amanda did really great in her speech.
@gojisama I wish I could make a living out of criticizing people for a living without living home üôÇ unfortunately that's not the case.
@gojisama I'm being honest! Not a keyboard warrior! If you were infront of me I would say it to your face. This is the internet and it's my only way of communicating my opinion, that doesn't make me a keyboard warrior if I'm being honest in my opinion. Every news outlet made it seem like this girls speech was special and I don't understand, how? It's my opinion and I voted for biden and can't stand trump. Good for her! But in my opinion I just didn't understand why everyone was making a big deal. Is that ok? Can I have my own opinion without being labeled a keyboard warrior? I'm not talking bad about her personally, I just didn't understand why the speech was so special
No one said this was "special". You're a keyboard warrior that sits around all day doing nothing criticizing people for a living... The fact is, the entire video is just a recording of Amanda's speech. That's it.
Bless her and her gift Lord, and use it for her good, but Your Glory, in Jesus Holy Name, AMEN.
Blacktifulll poem
Nice words, Amanda a great moving poem. But, do not let the craziness of being on the spotlight get to you, keep it sane. As far as running for President in 2036, that is a long way off but a nice thing to consider. Just do not let other people use your hopes and dreams for their own purposes.
Amanda The Poet Our Future is in your hands , keep writing and loving the things that make you happy ‚úåÔ∏è
Hilarious
That was a lame rap song
It‚Äôs a free verse poem. In fact, one of the earliest poets, Walt Whitman, wrote in a similar fashion to Amanda, and he is considered one of the greatest modern poets of our time.

https://rushlimbaughjrjr.blogspot.com/2021/01/biden-harris-shipwreck-2021.html Well Lets see interesting year Biden wins ,Pennsyllvanis by 25,000 more votes than Registered voters. He wins Wisconsin by 17,000 more votes than voters, their were two states with over 300,000 combinred votes that were from people who did not exist, But according to the courts all the way up to the supreme court who said it was legal, needless to say i no longer, trust the supreme court
All should be equal because God does not support racism, division and inequality. Loving this. Keep it up! "And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect *We are striving to forge a union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man* And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside"

@good life Exactly ! Ugly hearts, ugly souls, ugly consciences, ugly minds, etc.... God is for love, unity, peace, hope, joy, faith, grace and His driven wisdom. More need to read His Word, and grow a personal relationship with the One who actually created them, to do better when it comes to serving Him, themselves, others and be more of a positive influence within this world He created for us All - or they are just roaming around lost, incomplete, destructive and downright miserable. And we all know how misery loves company.
@wise guy Again with response to your last 3 posts..... *1) The United State of American *One Nation Under God* with Liberty and Justice For All. Hmmmm seems like you should join another country. *2)* Are you also speaking of the person responsible for Covid getting out of hand now within the US alone there are 25,708,124 cases with 431,882 deaths? What about all the other crisis in this country effecting millions of lives that started in the last 4 years? You want to speak about life? Further, NO politician from either party supports infanticide, or killing a baby that‚Äôs been born, which is illegal Those that do choose this option for a myraid of reasons, where are the laws and programs in place to TO HELP resolve the surrounding issues in order to GET RID of the reasons as to why some choose this option. *3)* Sorry to break it to you but there is nothing imaginary about God - and if you believe that, you are in for a rude awakening during this life time, as well as what comes aftewards.
@good life ur telling me an ugly heart for not beliving in youre imaginary friend? Sorry mate but the invisible and the non-existing look very much alike..
@Zeal0t Seven Looks like kelly shut him up. lol. God don't like ugly hearts.

@kelly hno if you want to live in a country leaded by god you better go to join the Taliban but sometimes its hard to tell the difference betwen taliban and fundamental christians
@kelly hno People are shooting medicals with shotguns in the name of youre god for having committed abortion
@Zeal0t Seven God is love which is why he the first in line that should be involved. In otherwords, he should be put first in our lives. The Living Bible (His Word) is the greatest teacher and guide thru this so called life, of all time. He created us all with unique special gifts and talents. He knows each and everyone of us more than we could ever possibly completely know ourselves.
@wise guy We were All made in God's own image. He does not like division nor racism. He intended us all to Love, Live and Work together towards prosperity and success. Everyone should have that shot without any road blocks. This is the United States of American One Nation Under God with Liberty and Justice for All. Not the Divided Confederate States of America under No God with Liberty and Justice for a certain Race.
wow your first sentence is so wrong unless we aren't talking about the same god
Why does God have to be involved? As compassionate and caring people we can speak for ourselves and say no to hate and injustice.

@Insert Name Here I‚Äôm a very liberal communist, so I‚Äôll only be sentencing you to 6 months in Gulag for your post. Joking, obviously. But it‚Äôs not even any kind of ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù politic that I can see. It‚Äôs just the SAMO neoliberal corporate machinery of the disgusting DNC- the Democratic National Corporation. Plus the locus of their Hollywood and News media drones. Indoctrinating the youth of our country to their nihilistic, cynical, lifeless political-cultural programming.
Me too.
same bro
@Donovan Zuniga Complaining about homework is valid. Complaining about the poem itself is valid. But complaining about a weird assignment like this is particularly important, because it informs me about what school during the pandemic is like; I _never_ had to a homework assignment about a slam poetry recital about a president‚Äôs inauguration, not even in college, not even when President Obama got sworn in (which was a HUGE deal at the time, believe me. People cried and everything). My only question is how can it be ‚Äúhomework?‚Äù I thought everyone was doing school from home already. All the kids I know are going to school online, where I live.
same bruh
That sucks. Of all her poetry, why your teacher pick this one? And of all of the poets... why not Audre Lorde or someone?

If you go to the CIA website it details the armies for the world and their numbers of troops, tanks etc. China currently has 1000 divisions of troops. Thats 10 million soliders. We know that in order for China to rule the world they would want the resources of the Americas thus unless we use nukes nor will they. Their troop strength out numbers us 10 to 1 as the last time I looked we have 100 divisions. So even if they send their entire army usimg conventional warfare tactics we still our still out number their armies 3 to 1 as the population of the United States is 328 million minus the ones not willing to fight. The young and old, children etc. We still have approx 100 million citizens willing to fight back. So you wonder why am I explaining all of this. If the current administration bans and tries to confiscates are assult weapons what do you think the outcome will be knowing we have as of current 393 million guns registered in the US? I hope I am painting a picture for whomever decides to read this lengthy post the our gun rights are so important . Guns were designed first and foremost as tool of liberty which we turned into modern sporting rifles for hunting etc. My point is our 2nd Amendment rights which state the right to keep and bear arms against all enemies foreign and domestic is a right not a law. Take them away and you better start learning the Chinese language. My fellow Americans. No matter what your beliefs are, no matter what your political affiliation is the firearms is an instrument of liberty and freedom. I'd fight for each and everyone you if need be. Millions of us would as well. We all have red blood and we need to start thinking as one nation so this great nation will not perish from the earth. The firearm is the tool that will protect us all and our way of life. While you bbq this weekend in your back yard with neighbors friends and family let's not forget why we get the great privilege to keep doing so. Are armed forces. We Americans are that force. Let's keep it that way.

This is tremendous... so why is there a bloody great sticker over her face saying 'The Inauguration blah blah...' WHO IS IN CHARGE? I want to see HER BEAUTIFUL FACE. CNBC, WTF?? MOVE it somewhere else!!
Beautiful words... Now what do we do?...
Those words and her eloquence can spontaneously combust Trump and his racist supporters...
ü•î Honestly, I enjoyed this poem and performance. It's sad how much negativity is shown in these comments. Regardless of whether you like this or not, I hope you guys all have a good year! ü•î
i'm surprised the trolls are even on a poetry video... that's like... literacy
@Zed Dravot Propaganda of what?
@Anthony Pritchard Wrong. I never supported Trump, I do however have taste in poetry that prevents me from considering this as anything but amateurish propaganda.
The haters are all Trump supporters, they'll do anything to criticize the left even if it means making fun of someone's inability.
It's too bad politicians can't put their differences aside for the sake of the country‚òπÔ∏è

wow an awesome poet i ve ever come across :: ) thanks Amanda.
My eyes hurt from rolling so much. What a load of virtue signaling nonsense.
I enjoyed this poetry to the bone. Thank you!
Thank you so much for this video!!!?

He just left and went to the Panhandle pandhadling.
What very strange comments here. 'She's acting', 'it's BS', 'deep state'. 'Somebody else wrote it'. OMG. Can these people not believe that some people actually have talent?? Are they so consumed with hatred? Cynicism? No wonder America is in so much trouble. Such violence, so much denial of reality. 4000 deaths a day from coronavirus. People actually killing each other in the streets. Such ingrained racism. Such denial. Such negativity. Like so many other people in the world, I‚Äôm glad I don't live there....if some of these comments are an indication of the soul of the country, the country is very unwell. When it's people cannot believe a truth standing in front of them, and take that person on proven face value, it's doomed. If this young woman who is a Harvard graduate (she ain't no dummie) and has been writing poetry for years, is a 'fraud', it's time to lie down and die. And, yet probably lie down with the belief, that a PROVEN lying, cheating, bully of a 'businessman' conman can be 'a great president' for America - 'the GREATEST'. Such ignorant immaturity.
IKR!! Put aside political differences and at least appreciate her poem! If people wanted to complain about the outcome of the election, they did NOT have to come to the poem video to do it. Here are the 3 comments above yours: "My eyes hurt from rolling so much. What a load of virtue signaling nonsense." "She sounds, moves and looks like an alien that just stepped out of a space ship to trick earthlings. Proof aliens are not little green men. And why she keep wiping her nose n mouth with her hand. Rank! " "The cheaters are back in office. I swear I will not buy or rent any video's, movies or music until these corrupt people are out of the white house! " These comments are so disrespectful, ignorant, salty, and partially irrelevant.

@Victini There you have it, it‚Äôs not meant to be theatrical, yet she moves more than an inflatable arm-flailing tube man. My criticism had nothing to do with the content, but just the form; I also think most people would not have paid much attention to her if the media and influencers had not gone crazy over the speech basically forcing people to ‚Äúlove it‚Äù. In terms of the content, I think a big part of the message is actually quite combatant and not very unifying given the current situation of the country ... Moreover do you not see the incredible CONTRADICTION in what you say in your comment!?!? How can you talk about unity and then assume almost half of the population is against you. YOU are the one dividing society into teams, trying to box them into airtight ideological blocks without any information. Fortunately, society is not as simplistic as you would want it to be, and I think there are more people on the side of getting over our differences rather than manically focusing on them.
It‚Äôs not meant to be theatrical. The girl is just reciting her poem of unity. Since you seem to be right-leaning by your rush to criticize, it is befitting of you to want to tear down this girl.
Black washing is cancel culture.
I wish I could say I share her optimism but I don't; at least not in the short term.
Black people on the grassroots reject this crap.We dont want poems,we want tangibles.#cutthecheck
Let's look more closely at this Harvard graduate, activist poet. For example, here's a stanza from a poem she wrote several months ago concerning the pandemic, so it is contemporaneous. The poem is titled, "The Miracle of Morning," and herewith the second stanza: "I see a dad with a stroller taking a jog. Across the street, a bright- eyed girl chases her dog. A grandma on a porch fingers her rosaries. She grins as her young neighbor brings her groceries." Are you kidding me? First, ANY qualified (and I know that's asking a lot today) English instructor might see something like this in high school freshman English and still give it a "C". BUT, BUT even worse, is that a Harvard graduate uses the TOTALLY incorrect plural, "rosaries " and apparently NO ONE noticed, least of all, Amanda. How many rosaries did Grandma have that she was fingering? The standard number is one, unless she has Alzheimers.
@Popn No problem. I thank you for and accept your apology.
@RMPsumma ohh. tysm for explaining and sorry again.
@PopnA rosary is a single item. One cannot pray or say more than one rosary at a time. Or to use Amanda's verb form, "fingering" which she certainly means as a synonym for saying or praying. Therefore, Correct: "I say (pray) the ROSARY." "You say (pray) the ROSARY." "She (as in Grandma) says (prays) the ROSARY." The ONLY way Grandma's "fingering" (not the greatest word choice, either) her "rosaries" is if she has more than one on her lap and she's literally "fingering" them, for whatever bizarre reason known only to Grandma. Alzheimer's was my comedic guess. In other words, it is totally and irrevocably incorrect to say or write, "I'm saying (or praying) my rosaries," unless you add something like, "for the week," or "I'm praying ten rosaries to fulfill my prayer pledge," thus definitely intending the plural form. And after all this, Amanda is still wrong. Oh, and of course one can own ten rosaries, or buy two rosaries or whatever.
@RMPsumma When I linked you to a dictionary, I didn't mean to say that you were wrong, and were dumber than a 5th grader. I meant that "rosaries" was the correct plural of "rosary", and that I wanted to know what you meant by "TOTALLY incorrect plural". I'm sorry I totally didn't clarify enough and came off as rude, but anyways, what did you mean by "incorrect plural"?
@Popn When you accuse me of "hate" and then direct me to dictionary sites to educate me on the plural of a noun a fifth grader should know, what would you call it other than "acting smart?" If you didn't know what I meant, wouldn't simply asking me have been the appropriate thing to do?
@RMPsumma idk anything about rosaries that's why I asked. What does "The standard number is one, unless she has Alzheimers." mean? I don't know much about this subject and I never said I did, so please don't make it look like I was acting smart. I wasn't, and I had no intention of aggravating you.
@Victini No name? That's perfect! Another patronizing, condescending twit making totally unfounded accusations. I offer a critical observation, nothing more nor less. However, I have a right to be angered when someone equates my legitimate criticism with "hate." You do exactly the same only in a more florid style. I have nothing personally against this girl, but the gushing praise for her work is unwarranted. Let's see. No name thinks criticism should be proffered only to "aid" (as if she'd accept it in any case). No name further reads whatever he wants into a comment. You're fairly risible in your priggishness. How's that, no name? LOL. YOUR overwrought and uncalled for comment is noted and equally dismissed. Thanks for the laughs, though.
@RMPsumma Wow, an overreaction of gargantuan proportions! It is fine to critique her work and point out flaws and inconsistencies but the rancor with which you approach this is unnerving. This woman is clearly talented and still in need of refinement but your criticism branched from one of aid to one of animus. Barring all literary skill, what is so unbearably incorrect that you harbor antipathy for the woman? You treat the matter as if she is an incorrigible. Your undue hysteria is noted and dismissed.
@Popn Unbelievable apologia. Yes, it's one verse -- but I'm not going to go through an entire poem. I don't have the time or the stamina or the inclination. I picked one verse as a notable example of mediocrity. Yes "rosaries" is the damn plural of rosary! Yes! Yes! Yes! But it's incorrect as SHE USES IT! Little Miss Harvard! I even explained the reason it's wrong in my comment, but it didn't remotely register with you. Why are people who don't know what they're talking about the first to want to make fools of themselves by attempting to counter a credible comment with utter nonsense? To the leftist nutsos, legitimate criticism is now "hate!" Outrageous!!!!!!!! Btw, you don't know much about rosaries, either.
That's only 1 stanza though. If a high school English teacher graded that 1 stanza as a freshman's whole poem, I'm sure he might get a "C", but this isn't the whole poem. And I don't quite understand what's wrong with the plural of "rosary". "rosaries" is the correct plural for "rosary", I think https://www.google.com/search?bih=625biw=1366hl=ensxsrf=ALeKk01hrF4ewpn2FjbAXPeIgdp4JGmRWw:1611630615354ei=F4gPYIf5FITn9AOL5LCoBQq=rosary pluraloq=rosary pluralgs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB46BAgjECc6BAgAEEM6BQgAELEDOggIABCxAxCDAToKCAAQyQMQFBCHAjoFCC4QsQM6BwgAELEDEEM6AgguOgQIABAKUJUwWKxCYONKaABwAXgAgAGJAYgB7weSAQMyLjeYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEBsclient=psy-abved=0ahUKEwjH4Njyz7juAhWEM30KHQsyDFUQ4dUDCA0uact=5 . And it's probably not completely crazy for a grandma to finger more than 1 rosary. I'm not a poet, and I don't know much about poetry, but I don't think this hate is reasonable. Is she really THAT bad?

@Everything‚ÄôsComingUpMilhouse amazing. I‚Äôm sure you have been ‚Äòred-pilled‚Äô and now understand everything. funny how that is. I mean to say, funny how one could believe that there is an all-powerful group of individuals who control everything yet you- you a person of nothing in such a system- are allowed to gain so much knowledge that you learn of their existence. how logical üôÑ
Because you‚Äôre being brainwashed.
Because our teachers have no will to do something interesting
More like political prose than a poem.

@MShroomii When the speaker started using political phraseology like president and democracy maybe? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Mr. Meerkat when did basic human respect and being better as a people become a political idea?
@MShroomii It was a political speech that was erroneously presented as a poem.
It‚Äôs a free verse poem. Poems don‚Äôt have to rhyme or have a set pattern or rhythm. In fact, one of the earliest poets, Walt Whitman, wrote in a similar fashion to Amanda, and he is considered one of the greatest modern poets of our time.
so... free-verse?

Bundi Gundi
what does have ‚Äúskinny‚Äù have to do with it
it just contributes to the thematic imagery, it is poetry after all
In my opinion, it contributes to the notion that physical strength is not what brought her here but acts of moral strength and mental acuity. Which makes sense since her poem touched on topics like the resilience of democracy against things like the insurrection from trump supporters, and the USA's perseverance through supremacy and opression
my dog had her ears up looking at it
I will hope that changes will come soon in america if the poem was done by a with girl
Incredible
8K despicable denizens of the shade she articulates showed up to repudiate her message of hope to humanity and desire to build a better tomorrow.
@No Name It‚Äôs no use reasoning with people who are driven by hate and emotion instead of reason and logic. Trump supporters are Trump supporters for a reason after all...
@David I suppose, given that it doesn't carry any conspiracy theories or peddle hate fuelled lies .
Or maybe they don't like the poem. And I understand them
what is the message behind this speech I'm only here for my homework
@mackeyboy amane üòÇ i thought it was a beautiful speech but this is hilarious
she was talking about how much money she has and that she'd bust a cap on someone's ass after she's finished talking
Remix!
That voice went in one ear of Bidens, and out the other... This country is smoke and mirrors, and benevolence, equality; and justice is a joke to the PTB. These people are puppets controlled by deep state, a luciferian power with an agenda that has been working to design this country to be exactly the opposite of what she's speaking.
ok boomer
She doesn‚Äôt only dances with words, but also with her hands.... love this ‚ù£Ô∏è
@Master Joe Ker *hitler and stalin would like to show some of their speeches *
Her words, her delivery, her gestures and her mannerisms are perfect. Such a great performance, message and young woman!
This is literally the worst speech in history
@Retardo Davinci what do you mean?
doesnt everyone in this rank of hierarchy do that? i mean look at trump or just any president before that.
I can't believe 8000 people disliked this. So sad.
@lmozep "divers"??? Political Correctness is a HUGE part of the problem because it inhibits critical thinking. Example: Having to use the term 'African American' WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE PERSON. NO ONE can tell, merely from LOOKING at a person, that they are American or indeed from Africa. It's a stupidity that boggles the mind. 4 years won't change ANY OF THAT. (The depth of intellectual laziness in this country goes deep).
@Andrea Andrea uneducated? lets see where america stands in 4 years. and if all the poltical correctnes and the so "divers" members of bidens team will make a good job.
@Reaver Red haha People from CCP China are in the back room, aren't they?
@chong qing68 The deep seated anti-intellectualism in America needs to be addressed. Americans are terrified of the Mind. Americans need to be educated. Education in America is appalling.
The educated can alter the number?
The uneducated. There are a LOT of those in this country.

This is, without a doubt, one of the most platitudinous, dull, grasping, uninspiring and ineffective ‚Äúpoems‚Äù I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of hearing. Utter drivel- complete nonsense that does not reflect the attitudes and/or realities of the general populous at large. I‚Äôm convinced more than ever that virulent and caustic nihilism is the only way forward. All hope abandoned.
I‚Äôm a try something, see what will make a reply get deleted: She has a sociology degree from Harvard; she attended a private (that means expensive) school in LA K-12; She included that line about being raised by a single mother to make herself appear like she came from nothing, but in all seriousness, she is the epitome of privilege. THIS IS A SHAM :)
Calm down austimo it‚Äôs just a poem not like you can do better lmao
I needed to be energized .This truly energized me and brought a new light into my life .
I have read this "poem' --- It is STUPID. iT HAS NO RHYME NOR REASON -- IT HOLDS NO ACTUAL BASES IN HISTORY FOR THE BLACK PEOPLE -- ONLY FOR WHITE AMERICA. The justice in America is not broken -- it was created by Biden to destroy the black family along with those before him. They picked this poem because it had nothing to do with the Black people in America and everything to do with continual Systemic Racism. FIND THE TIME TO READ IT --- QUESTION EACH LINE. RESEARCH THE WORDS AND HOW THEY ARE USED. SHE IS THE PRODUCT OF THE BLACK SCHOOL SYSTEM WHERE HISTORY WAS NOT TAUGHT NOR THE COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE -- ONLY HOW TO WORSHIP THE WHITE PEOPLE.
She's not actually saying anything. It's rather nonsensical and totally lacking in substance. You could make this stuff up on the fly, just say it with that preacher inflection. There's no there there.
I agree. Very boring
Too flowery IMO. I came back here because it‚Äôs only been 4 days and I‚Äôd already forgotten what the poem was about (which is really a bad sign for a poem, although I really did enjoy listening to her recite it at the time). I‚Äôm not hating, good cadence and effective delivery makes it pleasing to my ear, but I still can‚Äôt exactly figure out what she‚Äôs trying to say. Like, I can tell exactly what Kipling‚Äôs ‚ÄúIf‚Äù is about (Stoic life advice being passed down), I can tell you exactly what ‚ÄúThe Hollow Men‚Äù is about (The cataclysmic horror of WW1 and Imperialism), I can tell you exactly what ‚ÄúA dream deferred‚Äù is about (the righteous ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù of fury by freed African-American slaves by promises broken to them), and I can‚Äôt even recite most of the words to them. I guess I‚Äôm just not very literate. Can someone more literate than I please explain the message of this poem to me?
@Bennie Washington I have plenty of problems, my friend. By average probably no more or less than anyone else. But unfortunately I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. Of course I agree that poetry doesn‚Äôt have to rhyme (I don‚Äôt think it even has to be verbal or written ; ‚ÄúPoetry in Motion,‚Äù for examine). Neither _The Hollow Men,_ nor the Langston Hughes poem I cited, nor Nikkita Oliver Slam Poetry I enjoy rhymes in a traditional sense. However, _good_ poetry must have content, or at least a message it‚Äôs trying to convey. This is what I call an ‚ÄúEmpty Poem;‚Äù bad poetry. It lacks gravitas, a coherent message, or an emotional delivery. Which, in a ‚Äúmeta‚Äù sense, makes it the prefect poem for President Biden.
You didn't seem to have any problems, poetry is not a rhyme
@Cornelius Johnson Let me know what you think. I find her as a kind of antidote for the style over substance emptiness that the young women‚Äôs poem in the video shows (or I guess, *doesn‚Äôt show*).
@dethkon I'll check her stuff out btw
@dethkon She sounds like your average mid west valedictorian graduation speech. Also, I've gotten in the habit of questioning anybody who seems to pop up out of nowhere. Way too much reconciliation words for a nation that don't even acknowledge ish
@Cornelius Johnson You hit it, this is the reason why I can‚Äôt figure out what the hell she‚Äôs trying to say in this poem. And from a young poet laureate? Just... mediocre. If I wanted to listen to slam-poetry (Which I‚Äôll admit, I still enjoy sometimes!) I‚Äôd listen to Nikkita Oliver. She‚Äôs my personal favorite of this type of poetry.
That's because she didn't say anything tbh. It's full of cliches and a Disneyland perspective on American race issues. I don't care if someone thinks I'm a hater lol

American kids are indoctrinated with the question "who would I become?" instead of "which problem can I/should I solve?".
@Tran Viet Prevails in the West in general. Or places with mobility or opportunity. Be it Canada, Germany, wherever. The indoctrination part sounded weird. As human if theres a chance, we ponder on what we'd be. That doesn't negate the possibility of "What to do better", but it doesn't beg the question.

it is disappointing where we are now and where we are headed. I see so many people are products of the environment they create and rely on i.e. social media reality tv, and a host of propaganda outlets praying on the vulnerability of those who choose to ignore history, change and the reality of the moment. The best chance we have is to be ever vigilant to protect this experiment in democracy by fighting lies and deceit with truth and reason. @Chris Render
How bout now how do you feel where this country is headed
@random kid 7 Hello and thank you for your message. When I was in my teens, so many years ago now, there was never any doubt about entering into the armed forces---it's what every young man and some women did and wanted to do. Service and sacrifice for our country was a given for everyone really. I very much appreciate your words of appreciation, but I was only doing what came naturally when you love your country.
Thank you for your service and sacrificing your life for the protection and wellbeing of our nation. May God be with you.
Thank you for your service you are a an inspiration
@Merle Bicknell Thank u for your service
Thank you for your service, you‚Äôre a hero
@Chris Mabry It can sometimes come to pass that those who harbor fear and hate can later embrace compassion and caring. Of course there is also the opposite that can occur as well. It seems to be ware we are at present, wouldn't you say? Thankfully this country has and will for ever embrace change when there is wrong doing and ill will interfering with will of ALL the people's rights. I can only presume you meant to point out a time in history and meant no ill will towards anyone, That's correct isn't it?
@Merle Bicknell If you voted for the Democrat party you are not someone who wants "accepted equality without ill will." They literally were the people who fought for slavery in the first place (although the civil war was more complex than simply slavery). For example. the democrat party is the only party pushing for segregationist policies like affirmative action. Affirmative Action definition: "The practice or policy of favoring individuals belonging to groups known to have been discriminated against previously." Literally textbook racism. Also, the democrat party is the only party who puts down white people, and deliberately disadvantages them simply because they are white. The Democrat party should be ashamed, and so should this brainwashed girl, for believing that their cause is equality. In fact their cause is far from that. United we stand, but divided we fall, and the democrat party is a party of division. Lastly, how can someone like you, who served for our country, even look at these people when they made fun disabled vets, and denied them medical help? The country you should truly be proud you served is the country that held the core values of America. Life, liberty, and unity under God, not the country the Democrats are trying to build. Or should I say destroy. Become informed, don't wait until despotism to fix the problem. They want to control us. Wake up.
@Simon Wang As long as we believe, it will come to pass that someone will say "In the past there was great anger and terrine. but no more"
You touched my heart, I thank you so very much. 3
@Nickey Bordelon When I was young, many years ago, I read the words on the pedestal of the statue of Liberty which read ‚ÄúGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.‚Äù It never occurred to me that, for so many Americans, would be so hateful and not understand these words are meant for everyone and not a select few. The very foundation of our country is based on diversity of beliefs and the ability to seek freedom, Justus and liberty from those who would suppress it.
A very sincere thank you for your service .. God bless you .
In your hands
@dethkon Your words are comfort food for the soul. I will follow your many success in the future and rest well knowing that America's true greatness is
Your welcome.
@yui tsoi Your more then welcome, you can rest assure that thousands of people before me and thousands more after me have and will defend the beliefs that the constitution put forth all those years ago so are never lost to time
Thank you for your service.
The last two lines get me every time
Sitting under the shade it means there is light.Open the eyes
What a load of tripe
I love you little sister, you are powerful and brilliant. A light for the world to behold. Stay strong, grow stronger in God‚Äôs name. Yes to you.
Even as..she gives us hope. ..
5 minutes of a perfect speech. Never heard that from trump. I'm glad that we are heading into a better future.
This women really talented with expression I loved it and the poem which she made mind blowing!
The amount of mindless drones in the comments, lol... Truly brainwashed sheep.
Why is she dressed like a cheeseburger?
‚ÄúOur blenders become their burden‚Äù... how perfect a perception, and such a subtle take down to those people who refuse to be part of our society.
@David Canning I checked out the posted written versions.
@Patchessleeping Sorry, I am a foreigner, it was how I heard it

Stupid. So what?
soo much BS
Peace
Dislikes? Huh?
Indeed and very truly indeed, "Quiet isn't always peace."
@V k oh you mean BLM? And ANTIFA? CUZ I was at the capital, and I identified several people who were caught looting and rioting and identified as BLM and ANTIFA..... sooo not sure where you were going with that. Anyone who has military surrounding a building with a wall to keep all the plebs away and paying media news outlets and "fact checkers" to say "tHeRE waS No vOTeR FraUD" ... That would be disinformation as hundreds of people have come forward and said there was voter fraud. I want to remind you of one thing, if "Trump supporters" or "republicans" or "conservatives" WANTED to take over the capital, they would have brought their guns and they would still be occupying the capital. But this was a liberal BLM and ANTIFA riot that just wanted to give the media and Democrats a reason to enforce Communism on the american people by now painting all "Republicans" or "conservatives" as a political party to oppress just like the Chinese Communist Party put everyone of the opposing party in jail or killed or a "reeducation camp" which has been suggested by Pelosi and to "drone strike" conservatives in their homes for opposing Dictator Creepy Uncle Joe and his insane policies according to a media reporter who works for CNN. Now who oppresses people for their political beliefs? A dictator. Who controls the media? A dictator. Who killed the President of Tanzania? He went missing for 10 days and then their media said "oh uh he had a heart attack." Because he wouldn't play the game of COVID-19 being a pandemic. Now the american Media is painting the Tanzania President as a dictator, but he wasn't. He just took the covid 19 tests and tested pawpaw fruit, mango, a sheep, and a goat and they all came back positive for covid 19. He told the media to spread the news that the tests from china were defective to provide a narrative that everyone has covid. But you go ahead! Just let me know what Biden has done that wasn't a communist act. üòâ
Thankfully the dictatorship that tried to take the capitol with their terrorist friends failed. And now we get to listen to the failures that scurried to the shadows like cocroaches complain on YouTube. Instead from inside the white house.
@KT Rainbow the elections weren‚Äôt fraudulent, there was no evidence of any such thing happening. you‚Äôre building this idea of Biden being a dictator from evidence that doesn‚Äôt exist, simply opinions or prejudice. whilst I don‚Äôt think there can be a perfect leader for America, i think that there can always be a better one. And how has Biden taken over the country with military force? Genuinely curious.
@zainab I Dictator tells you what you can and cannot do or you will be punished. A dictator takes over a country with military force (read the Times magazine article on how the election was fraudulent and "we should be thankful for it!") And military and fences will continue until May for the capital. Here are 2 mixed race twins to let you know their thoughts on Dictator Biden https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3872369726177460id=153657598048710
@KT Rainbow Do you even know what a dictator is
Right.is that why Dictator Creepy Uncle Joe hasn't spoken to BLMü§îü§î
America is just racist and will always be when will african americans wake up and
sucks lol
Amanda Gorman has well expressed how United we stand, divided we fall!!!
Historic speech

"BELLY OF THE BEAST" Who is that? SYSTEMIC WHITE RACISM MEANS ALL OF US! IS BLACK CRIME SYSTEMIC? Systemic¬†describes what relates to or affects an ENTIRE system. For example, a systemic disease affects the entire body or organism, and systemic changes to an organization have an impact on the entire organization, including its most basic operations.

A poem to this great genius of poetry, I came to this channel to hear this poet speak, I realize now she hasn't even hit her peak, her words are of Glory and Hope, this is a sermon that should be heard by the Pope, she has the will to become even more great, as long as she has a great mind and Spirit to create, to work in Congress should be her next challenge, because she's had such great talent

Beautiful
Great
SUCH ODD COVERAGE OF THIS ENTIRE THING!!! OTHER THAN THE SAME SHOTS/ANGLE OF BIDENS GROUP BEHIND PODIUM, ALL AUDIENCE LOOK LIKE PAID ACTORS!!!! NO ZOOMING IN ON ANYONE IN THAT CROWD MUCH HUH? FUNNY CAUSE WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT SNAPSHOTS OF THIS IT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE A STAGE WHERE THEY ADDED TREES AND LITTLE BLOBS OF COLOR TO LOOK LIKE PEOPLE!!!!
US Americans like this kind of speach. The rest of the world considers it as overdrawn and ridiculous. Both Republicans and Democrats think the US are the centre of the world, but hell, you‚Äôre not. A nation that isn‚Äòt broken? Weeellll, ... not so sure!
I love this so much I literally translated the whole poem into my first language (French). It's on my channel. ^_^
Could you copy it for me? I would love to read it in French! I‚Äôm a French teacher and it would be wonderfully uplifting and educational to introduce my French students to this poem. Merci beaucoup !
Love everything about it. The cadence, the alliteration, the beautiful dance with words, the message, the delivery. Spellbinding.
Lol at all the pretentious virtue signalers liking this condescending drivel üòÖ
What a joke. Skinny black girls dreaming of Presidency? Let Kamala tell you how it really works. Let Kamala tell you how to get to the top. It's not what you know. Its who you know.

‚ÄúWe have braved the belly of the beast‚Äù.
A low class dig at Trump, but lets shower her with compliments, acolades, big titles, big job positions, and a modeling contract.
wait what minute was that in?
I‚Äôm just wondering why this post got the dislikes that it didüßê This beautiful young lady spoke peace and yet..... dislikes???? That lets you know the kind of world we actually live in where peace is frowned upon and or dismissed yet the opposite is the norm
Hope one day, Amanda, you'll come to Canada and visit us in Montr√©al
This looked like Amanda's Inauguration.
'What sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil, that dark is light and light is dark, that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.' - Isaiah 5:20 Repent and turn to Christ! We are told that the End Times will be dark indeed and we are all born as sinners. Joe Biden supports abortion and Kamilla Harris wants to tear down the American Constitution and says its outdated. (America was founded on God) Jesus mentioned events of what would happen in the End Times.. Matthew 24 1-'Jesus answered: ‚ÄúWatch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‚ÄòI am the Messiah,‚Äô and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.' The chapter of the bible in Revelation mentions the seven seals which include terrible events to come to those who have not repented. There will be something called a rapture where people will suddenly disappear from the earth and those are the Christians. What is left here will be events of the coming of an Antichrist up until receiving the mark of the beast (Satan) It condemns you straight to hell and the only other option is to die and only be a servant of God instead of inherit eternal life. John 14:16- Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Turn to Jesus now because we are all born as sinners. No man or President will be able to save you from what is to come. Only Christ was pure and if you want to be set free from what is to come and not be condemned to hell you need to accept Christ soon- Time is running out.. https://www.biblicalprophecyunfolding.com
Congratulations Amanda Gorman! God is in control.
DEAR MS. AMANDA GORMAN: I am amazingly impressed with you. Great Poetic Prose and Delivery! J.O.B. Done (Well Done).
Friggin amazing.
Great that she was an American and not a foreigner.
From a fellow poet, let me honour thy moment........Words weaved with elegance and poise,........As innocent as to not even break the noise........To heal and balm, restore society's calm, The shattered minds and shattered souls......Can now be made whole......Let's step forward with head held high..... Lets put our differences aside....... A stronger Nation we must be as a beacon of light for all to see...... Trials and tribulations will still now come, but together we fight as if we are one...... Greatest isn't measured in achieving great feats..... It's starts in our hearts where our very life beats..... When we stare into each others gaze..... to put the other first that's when we know we have lifted this old curse..... Hand in hand we will stand both women and man..... As a partner hand in glove respecting each others love..... Then and only then will the world begin to see..... This is the pathway to global harmony.

But antifa and BLM riot loot and break windows in the name of unity ! Ya right.
Dr Biden hahahah !!
What in the hell does she have on her head?
A democratic poet who likes to frequent Italy, for its history? No. For her culture? No. To frequent the Milanese upper class like Miuccia Prada: here they are the court jesters of the democratic party. Now only the logo remains democratic: ridiculous! How can they represent the American working class? I thought that in Italy we had incapable politicians but in the USA everything is always big!
I see the trolls are out.

She's brilliant.
This is amazing! I love how she includes Hamilton!! I‚Äôm going to learn the poem‚ù§Ô∏è
President of the United States of Voter Frauds
She shone like the sun on a new day.
Now I see. 81,000,000 people ARE brave enough to be a light.
She is incredible. Also the live for Hamilton references
@O K She literally said history has its eyes on us lol
@O K the scripture yes, but I heard other similarities too!
I thought the same thing for a second but Hamilton was referring to the Bible and so was she lol
If Romney had beaten Obama in 2012 I don‚Äôt believe a devout teenage Mormon would have given a biblical address about how they‚Äôd endured four years ‚Äúin the belly of the beast‚Äù

Well there are moments and there are moments and that was a moment, youth, guiding us a path, gives hope that our future can be better, amazing words from an amazing mind
Ms. Amanda Gorman stole President Biden's inauguration...I believe he was okay with it‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèæüá∫üá∏ #BlackGirlMagic

She a real hustla... The next Al Sharpton!!! Go on get these suckaz while the gettings good shawty
What a joke. Stolen election
Biden began his phony presidency with a disturbing inauguration speech that signaled his administration will target any political opponents who reject his radical agenda. This would be a continuation of Obama-era practices, which saw the Obama IRS, DOJ, FBI, CIA, etc. used to target Obama opponents ranging from small citizen Tea Party groups to then-candidate Donald Trump. Indeed, that virtually no ordinary Americans were allowed to view the proceedings in person thanks to a politicized military shutdown of our nation‚Äôs capital doesn‚Äôt augur well for this Republic and our civil liberties. And then Biden immediately undermined the rule of law by shutting down virtually all deportations and essentially ending all enforcement of our nation‚Äôs immigration laws. You can read the details here. And, of course, Biden‚Äôs mere presence in office is a challenge to the rule of law because of his personal corruption issues. There is substantial evidence, from documents and witness statements, that the Biden family, including President Joe Biden, may have been involved in criminal activity involving, among other issues, foreign entities tied to Ukraine and China. Joe Biden's son Hunter has already acknowledged that he is the target of an FBI criminal investigation.
I have read and replied (positive cmnts), but there is a Debbie Downer in every crowd. That is what is wrong with America today. We need to lift each other up, not tear down. We have all suffered with Covid, but yet, a lot of people are so negative. Is it really that hard to find some good in everybody. I thank God for my heart. And I feel sorry for the people picking her apart. It's disgusting. Esp, at a time like this. smh

She is 22yrs old....Absolute Genius!!!!

Can you imagine the very antithesis to what has been going on during these dreadful last four years? Well, 'ere we go.
Awesome! I Love it. Amazing.
Poet???????????????????????????? Shaddap pussi
Nice 'do! What's it made from?
The hate in the comments from people arguing she just wants division while talking about peace is the height of hypocrisy.
AOC wants to put white men in re-education camps. Good start for ''unity''.
üëåüëè‚ù£üí´
She made a statement.
She will never get her point across without looting and rioting
Making people cry when they're wearing facemasks. :-)
It's amazing how humans of all races look so alike. Amanda Gorman looks very East Asian. The only differences are the skin color and hair texture. Her features fit well in East Asia and in Africa. If only we noticed how much we look alike and see this as how we are related to each other, maybe there would be less racism. For racism is mainly based on hating those who look different.
I really love her English i wish i can also speak like her.
@Amanda sc gorman OMG!!! R u rlly Amanda Gorman!!!! You are my biggest inspiration, I memorized the hill we climb and hope to one day wrote a poem that amazing!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Wow.
That was amazingly awesome
She is an excellent public speaker and beautiful poet.
She must not be aware of how Biden uses the N word . Check You Tube , it's true
Nope not that one
You mean this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5mqIUXppVY ? He's quoting legislators from the cabinet of a reagan appointee that he was opposing. This quote is supposed to be damning for William Bradford Reynolds, whose staff obviously tried to push black people to the curb. You're cute when you're ignorant.
And the award to the best English teacher goes to Amanda Gorman üñ§ wow Her mother shd rly be proud of her
Beyond the lecture halls and statutory publications, a power of spoken words and articulate writing skill is a ‚ÄúPoet‚Äù on a platform to influence a nation. A fired-up poet is something.
A ray of light, a divine Angel! Thank You
wow cant wait to hear what you write after living in Bidens world young Lady
Amen nice I adore you
Love you

What a shame, people think that this man joe biden is somehow a decent person and that he'll do well, if they only knew, I've spent the last 2 yrs examining everything I could get my hands on about this man, his history and everything to do with the politics of the day, what a stinking shame that he's going undo what Trump did. And tell me something, why does this young lady have to present herself as black person daughter of a single mother come from slaves, good grief this is 2021, I come from an indentured servant of Sir Yeardly in the 1600's, so what? Why can't she just introduce herself as a poet. I don't care if she is black, yellow or purple, I feel like it's such pretentiousness that those who are black now have to have a serious introduction, they are just like me, so when I step up there as a poet myself, do I need to talk about my single mother, my ethnicity, no of course not, is she more special because of her individuality, of course not Everything about this administration, taking away what Trump has worked for and pretending that people in CA did not detest Kamala Harris for her many short coming as the AG, it makes me want to wretch. And we are not whole, we are guided by media who guard and cuddles the democrats, so that they can't be found out. We have those who try to mock, bully and diminish us as conservatives on the Right like never before. It is a scary time for us, and she's probably so young that she has no connection to what is really going on in this country. As they call good bad and bad good. And notice this, there were far more cheering for Trump after his goodbye speech, than the hello speech that Biden gave, it was embarrassing that so few were there, except for guards, it was so embarrassing my friends who live outside of DC said, as they actually wen to that innaguration thing. If you knew how badly the Left hates Trump, you'd understand that a coup was formed in 2015 to keep him from winning and those same people were never going to allow him to win this time. They planned out well, on what to put into place, and you'd have to be stupid not to understand what happened. Of course even the republicans who have to get along with the Biden administration are not going go say anything, except to say they saw no proof of cheating. Just in the last 3 yrs in different states, you can find verified cheating/fraud examples on youtube, this went on, on a massive scale in several ways.Yes, it happens, and in fact has been going on in Pennsylvania for decades. I'm almost 70, there isn't a lot that gets passed me these days.
You tell 'em Donna!! It just goes to show how low those Democrats will sink to use a young, idealistic, politically naive woman like this to promote their socialist agenda. What is more, she is from a privileged background and went to a private school in Santa Monica that costs $34K to $42K pa.
Those, who lived in socialism, know this politic poetry very well. Welcome to socialism.
@Mark Newbold Comrades are always the same. Through the time and countries. So when you know what to watch for, you can see it.
Damn, comrade who told you?
That has surely more flair and meaning than Ayn Rand that's for sure :')
WTF she is not wearing mask!! Covid is over!!!
She is very daring girl her speech and expression is mind blowing, hat's off lovely girl......
I do not wish to worry for her, but for some unknown reason, I do ... And that pains me, but then again, that is just MY fear showing, nothing to do with her ...
Over 7,000 dislikes on this video just because of an eloquent poem from an African American? I'm sure most of the dislikes are from White Supremacists (also known as Trump Supporters).
Prada?
Vain babbling
Why does she have a plane neck pillow on her head...........???????? Why
Am not only in love with the confidence ,its in the melody at which the words flow out of her mouth and the glow .
This girl has been given everything on a silver platter. One of those privileged people in America and she still can't do anything but complain.
no thanks. 1. he cheated 2. Liberals don't want peace or unity else they wouldn't be striving to get fired and doxx any Trump supporter that was in DC that day even ones that didn't even approach the capitol building. This country is screwed under Democrats.
DJT is the president . Do better YouTube
He isn't. Stop crying
AND JUST THINK ü§î! SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY VERY POWERFUL MEN  WOMEN...
This will be read for years to come, but will never have the same impact it has for us now because of what we‚Äôre living through
What was that on the head?
I'm getting old so hurry up and run for president.

exactly: "Talented Angel you are definitely showing off your ancestry coming from a line of kings, queens, emperors, chiefs and pharaohs. Standing out like no other. Keep it up!"

@A Biss they prolly do
@Stacey Gram You guys wanna be the victim so bad. sTaCEy
@Stacey Gram oh really? Then go support 'woke supremacists' and be quite. LOL what a joke that is. That is no comparision to centuries of heinous crimes white supremicists have done. Get a clue.
@Jonathan Alvarez oh really? Then go support 'woke supremacists' and be quite. LOL what a joke that is. That is no comparision to centuries of heinous crimes white supremicists have done. Get a clue.
@Yash200 Wzee Black supremacy is only a 'positive' in the eyes of black supremacists. Sorry for ruining your fun, racists * shrug *
@Stacey Gram still delusional are we? You came into a postive thread making a negative hateful remark.
@Yash200 Wzee When/how have I been 'hateful'? Oh, right, you're still just projecting...
@Stacey Gram Still hating....
@Yash200 Wzee Still projecting...
@**** It is a market that he targeted while campaigning. The bad people or the naive people. However you would think that the naive ones would know better to side with the bad ones. Or maybe they are just as bad in heart themselves. We got a good look at all of them on the videos that continue to surface from Jan 6th.
@Stacey Gram hate, hate, hate those who look different...its all people like you do. I would be embarrased too, to admit I support him.
@**** Project, project, project.... It's all leftists ever do.
You can't tell a trump supporter nothing. Remember they hate people who dislike trump, more than they actually care about trump. Like a cult where they don‚Äôt care if he is wrong. They will continue to turn a blind eye and ear even if he is so blatantly against God and his Word. So, unless: 1) you have a deep hatred for people of color ; 2) a greedy wealthy person with no ethics, morals on real values; 3) not educated on what trump's history of what he has said and done; or 4) not playing with a full deck of cards upstairs to follow someone that is clearly mentally unfit for this job.... there is no God-given reason to vote for him. His own family knows him and warns us, not to mention tons of respected witnesses, as well as video and audio tapes to prove it. Biden/Harris has better character to Lead our country back to where it should be, and do better.
@Yash200 Wzee Nope. Not a big fan of Trump. Still living in the sheepfold, are we?
@Stacey Gram poor thing. heading to Mar-a-Lago are we?
@Yash200 Wzee Keep projecting, brainwashed sheep. Literally every single thing that comes out of your mouth is the exact opposite of reality.
@Stacey Gram clearly you are in denial. History is the evidence duhhhh. Also you sound like the typical clueless ignorant stuff that hate groups want to spread as they support T r u m p ..... which would include white supremacists, neo nazis, Q, devil worshipers and others designated by Southern Poverty Law. Are you really that upset that they could not stop congress and what the constitution required on Jan 6, or because they were unable to storm the capitol yet again on this most Memorial Inauguration in US History?
@Yash200 Wzee No, but you're clearly projecting. Also, you wouldn't know 'history' or 'facts' if it hit you in the face. You're a brainwashed, delusional sheep, completely out of touch with reality.
This exceptional young lady is beautiful, bold and brilliant. Her hands are like musical butterflies. Her words give me hope for the new generation. I only smile when I think about what she will do in the years to come. Godspeed Amanda!
@Yash200 Wzee is she trying to say that white kings and queens were supremicists too?
@Stacey Gram awww... are you intimidated? Look up the history, just stating facts.
Sounds like the usual black supremacist ramblings to me...
Wow, just wow!
Excellent and love your yellow coat!

Hello candy how are you doing
7k thumbs down ? Wtf I don‚Äôt get why
Nice speech on the poem. She even talked better than Trump! Most of all. For every time this new president Biden speak and act like a true president. Unlike Trump, he talks like a street person, not professional whatsoever, and all about himself whatsoever!!!
My gosh its comical how fast they went from screaming this country was awful to the best country ever. She speaks about an attack on democracy that has only slowed because the babies are getting their way. The first time they are told no they will be in the streets rioting again burning the cities down and throwing their tantrums all over again. America one hour before Biden won by breaking the rules was inherently broken evil and racist it could not be repaired, but the cry babies got their way by breaking the rules and its the greatest nation ever. Watch and mark my words Biden is a career politician who made a ton of promises he knew he couldn't keep to get the votes. That used to be okay that used to be something we dealt with and expected. We used to be grateful for the promises kept and hope and pray next time we would get the rest. Not with this new generation I guarantee. They were threatening riots nearly as soon as Biden was announced President if they didn't get what they wanted all they wanted. AOC and her screaming crowds threatening Biden we should not so quickly forget. This is not peace this is a break from the temper tantrums because the babies think they got they way. This would have been a beautiful poem if we hadn't spent the past years being told by CNN MSNBC and everyone on the left what an awful unforgivable country America was just because Hillary Clinton didn't win. Let's not pretend it's anything but what it was sore losers burning down our cities trashing our country assaulting people because they didn't get what they wanted. Being patriotic is not something you do when your getting your way and don't when your not. Patriotism is not something you feel when your getting your way and don't when your not. That is exactly what this new form of being patriotic is and feeling patriotism is. For that reason this poem makes me want to vomit I hear nothing more then a 2 year old happy they got their way at the same time as you heard in the poem making threats of what will happen if they don't keep getting their way.
What the 20. of Maine did on the slopes of Little Round Top, this bright young woman did with her words. The men back then and she in our days defined the Union
The funniest thing is that kamAla was sworn in first, so technically she is the first woman vp...under Trump. HAHAHA!!! BWAHAHAHA!!!
She brought tears to these old and cynical eyes, wonderful. She almost made me want to be American again.
What country did you decide to go back to being you left America land of the Free! What county so we can start talking about the Country we protect. This is real talk #######

Biden what‚Äôs the plan for all the white homeless people? Oh yes, that‚Äôs right, allow more people in to the country. Biden what are you going to do about human trafficking or full term abortions? Come on man, answer some questions.
@Mark Newbold it‚Äôs called a process to legally come in to the country. Do you allow everybody into your home? Go and keep your doors unlocked and by all means pay all the taxes to support Biden‚Äôs country.

SHE IS SIMPLY AMAZING!
Did anyone tell her she attended the racist inauguration? No? Oh okay.
Smug, arrogant  divisive...perfect democrat.
Citizen Trump, this brilliant young American Lady is talking about YOU. Your hatred and lies gave birth to her words and made America PROUD again. Not goodbye, but good riddens to you, never to return.

"...Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division"
@Super Fantastic Top 10 you're right I got a cash app if he sent you a stimulus check you dont want
Biden is a neoliberal warmonger who has rejected min wage. This is Biden/Harris cynically riding the BLM wave. Most inaugurations have poets spouting similar claptrap about freedom and peace, then the US continues its rapacious foreign policy nevertheless.
@MrImpossiblyBlack True, but the Demoncrats are masters of it. Republicans kind of like things to be calm and stay the same.
Funny thing is the US government thrives on division. It can't justify it's current existence without constant conflict, that they often instigate, to sustain itself. The culture war were currently experiencing is one of their tools of division. Divide and conquer.
The left is division. Identity politics, cancel culture, hating anyone that doesn't agree with them. Sad.
@Lucy Ren√©e I agree. Complete garbage. Since I've been alive, I've never seen such a attempt to divide this country and cause its destruction. The democrats and all of our government do not give a sht about American citizens. They care more about foreigners and terrorists then our own people. We are easier to control if we are divided as a country.
@Corn Pop Ok, traitor.
@Corn Pop Liar.
The most important part in my opinion
@Joe Stupid Yes, you are as stupid as your name suggests. America's darkness started with Nixon and his machinations against an election, his pardon, Iran-Contra, the Clinton impeachment and was followed by the WMD lies, then birtherism and false flag claims, and finally now a President turning a rally into a murderous rampage on the legislature.
Your "hero" has done nothing but sow division, and he will continue to do so. America is now in darkness.
While Democrats sowed the most division..
@Lucy Ren√©e you‚Äôre not very smart are you?
Lucy Renee take ' from your name,it requires class
@Lucy Ren√©e crap is you
@Lucy Ren√©e Yes, you are.

Indescribable. I have no words. Thank you queen.
I wished this people racial removed the jurisdiction, and not making more,difficult bringing strife and our life,cuz my kids ignore,the situation,.
Wow, I‚Äôm so tired of sanctimonious, self righteous babble.
@Eden Sirgu It really is though. It's so vapid.
The odds you even listened to the poem are razor thin let alone being able to, process, analylize, or think critically for 5 minutes, is even slimmer of margins. The stench of your complexes reek and drown in inferiority. Not every statement needs to be hate ,cloaked in fear, layered in opposition. I am empathetic towards you, I really am. Your being exploited by faslehoods and reached a level where comfort in compartmentalizations outweighs any evidence, detail, or facts. It sad
Maybe if you would listen you would realise it isn't self righteous or babble.
Biden is the fake president elect
Did any of the words in her poem talk about cheating or stealing? Gag me with a spoon! You are worthless ! Pat yourselves on the backs...and see you on the battlefield!
Dear merciful God(s), please let her invocations be!
What about that criminal justice and police reform?
That‚Äôs the future, she brings hope
Hello there, I find it really odd replying to your comments here because I don‚Äôt usually chat with fans but I want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here . I realized how much you like and follow my channel. Thank you!!
Hello Ana
oh god the trump brain rot is real.
Angry Joe and Hateful Harris....what a pair!!! PRESIDENT Donald Trump---THE greatest president OF THE PEOPLE. Illegal Biden--- ur FIRED!!!
Stop sitting in the dark, and curse the darkness. Come out, live a life and brighten up. Life is short. Out there the sun still shines, and the sky is still blue. Trump is already a bygone.
And educate yo self!!! Hateful Harris was NOT a descendant of slaves---her great great WHITE IRISH GRANDFATHER OWNED SLAVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND her mother's lineage is HINDU INDIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We are now under a government coup. Joe Biden is a false king. And just like King Herod in the Bible, he will now go after all of his opposition.
Stay off my screen!!! Pure bs.
Absolutely yes she is American. What a generation what a blessing America is proud of you beautiful. A nation under God with great people. All God what a girl yes that's what the World is hoping to see in Americans. God blesse our Land.
Black raps matter.
Ungly
Hy Mai 1 second ago I wouldn't worry about the small minority that dislike her poem. I am more hopeful of a full generation of students who will become voters in the near future that will heed her words. That makes me smile to and proud to be an American.
Yeah after this speech this makes me want to do what I want and vote for trump again hopefully in 2024
Yes, the socialist revolution is well underway. I would be annoyed, except that you'll have to live in the dystopia you're creating, so that's justice of a kind.
Who is she
Amanda Gorman
My teacher made us listen to it in class, and we all loved it. Later we found out a parent emailed the teacher angrily asking her why she showed us this, saying it was ‚Äútoo political‚Äù. Some people...
@jrm8899 shut up
@Nick Johnsen Your one-liner plus the insult you were vulgar and cowardly enough to spew, tell a a lot about you.
@jrm8899 yup. It is easier that way right? "Only a CNN viewer would be tricked into believing something so transparent. I bet you think one direction is singing specifically to you like you are the only girl in the room" ü§£ü§£..... hey you.might be on to something... this is MUCH easier than actually having an argument with any merit.
@J W no point man. He is clearly dumb as a bag of rocks.
@Felix Ndayis de Bologne lmfao. You live in a fantasy.
@X V wow you are unbelievably naive ü§£ü§£ü§°ü§°ü§°
Only a FOX viewer would find those inspiring words political
how is that political
@Awkward Freakin Person Respect is something that you earn! I can respect racists like Talmadge or Wallace because even if I disagree with them and I hate their ideas, I see their integrity. Trump is exactly the opposite. A man about whom it is impossible to see anything positive, a guy who tried his best to destroy our system of government.
@Felix Ndayis de Bologne trump being a pad President is an opinion and I respect it but please respect others
@thugrug haha
Reaver Red You mean the speech she stole from Michelle Obama?
@Reaver Red Hell i bet Trump was impressed.
This is about pur country not politics.Its all of our story.
@Reaver Red They didnt do it for Biden's wife either. They did it for a young poet, and tehy did it for lady Gaga, because it was part of the ceremony.
@Felix Ndayis de Bologne are you trolling me? Democracy to you simply means you get the politician you want?
@J W A democratic country is a country were the Trump, the Bolsonaro , Erdogan or Duttierte are impossibilitate to hold any office , even that of county dog-catcher .
@Lisa Mockmee My words exactly! but it is CNBC so lots of useless virtue signallers here.
@Felix Ndayis de Bologne ? You do realize that this attitude is why we have war, don't you? Are you interested in living in a democratic country?
@J W It's exactly what a teacher should do. Showing that Trump has been the worst president in our history .
@X V the poem was still political.
Don't like the poem. Don't like the colors she is wearing either. As a matter of fact why was she at this inauguration? So political.
@X V yes it was about politics and hate thanks to psycho Dems and MSM. In case if you have not noticed there is still hate and politics. Nothing chnaged.
@X V and yet, somehow, based on your message, I know that you do not support Donald Trump as president. It's political.
Too political? 2016- 2021 was all about politics and hate....we don't live in a bubble...this poem is about ,courage, inspiration, compassion, imagination, soul,peace, self awareness, passion pain..heal.....thats the human spirit......
I do not know what is worse: this stupid speech or the people who pretend that it is wonderful just to virtue signal. It seems we do have only low expectations of people. I blame the school system for that.
This speech is clearly anti-Trump. Not appropriate for a teacher to show students.
wow thats dum her word are so amazing
I actually don‚Äôt know. It wasn‚Äôt even the speeches in the inauguration. It was the poem read by Amanda Gorman in this same clip.
That's sad. Your teacher was right to show this to you, and I feel sorry for the kid who has those parents.
Fake president..
@Mark Newbold His time will be finished in one year, from korea
Stop crying
Mind-blowing
No divide has been closed.... wake up. It's worse than ever...
then lets rise and become one... not just America as a country but one as a continent
Right?! It's maddening that so many are falling for the con-(artists/politicians)...their lies.
As a rare Democrat man from small town South Dakota I feel American again!Thankyou Amanda, I am in tears.If I am alive when you run for president ,you have my vote most definitely!
Lmao thank God you feel american again. Hate to lose a clown like yourself
@Reaver Red I felt American always ,but she told the truth.

A bit underwhelming. Sounds more like the lyrics of a song. Nice words. Adequate delivery. Average.
Wow gifted young poet...unbelievable....thank you for sharing....peace!!
She gave an interesting 6-minute speech . . . but, where's the poem?
Wow!! Lovely and very deep and wise for such a young person! Gifted!
Your graphic is too big, you're blocking her face. C'mon guys. Geez.
Look at those boogers coming out of her, almost as gross as the words

her dress reminds me on the chinese flag. good luck!
walks past everyone wearing a mask and not wearing one yourself
@Sarah Anthony it's cool but we are done with excuses for you to wear mask and exceptions for us not wearing them. Much like we are tired of hearing Democrats scream hair salons must be closed down because of Covid unless it's Nancy Pelosi that wants a haircut then it's fine to open them or how Gov. Gavin Newsom told us not to go out and socialize with friends and he turns around and goes to a party. with a dozen friends, yes we are tired of this we have sat back and watched their rules for you but not for me and it's time we collectively told them all to kiss our ass!
@Geeknoid She didn't open her mouth a lot when she walked by, and it's not like she was having prolonged contact with the crowd members. Also, everyone around her had masks, and as long as she put hers on shortly after, it's nothing to worry about. I don't think I need to explain why this isn't that big of an issue
@Sarah Anthony oh you mean she could not have a mask with her and to simply put it on before she walked through the crowd - right?
Um, because she was giving a speech? Literally everyone that spoke/sung took their masks off to be heard better. She obviously put a mask on afterwards

Good poem but poems don't sugar coat over fraud...
Love this!!! we need love to rise out of the ashes
Not wearing her mask.
Biden should give her a position in this cabinet so she can get experience to be president one day
She made everyone look so immature with her intelligence and passion in her heart. Her pome we all needed it and it was truly a WowUlation.

Desire to do what? Get welfare and become baby mommas?
To "be" what lol? A slam poet? Actually, millions of little girls - particularly black girls - will be aborted before they ever have a chance "to be" anything, thanks to socially "progressive" policies.
Sad day for America! Trump 2024!!!

wow..this is art..she was chosen from the first lady..if was melania trump..,,u can bet there were not poetry..like this one..
"Her poem was great stuff".
https://youtu.be/ITCMiBI2_nA How the hell did he make president???? He is soooo corrupt its not funny. Do you americans not see and realize his and his sons involvement in the Ukrainian power company scandal while he was vice president. His son gets put on a power company's board and getting payed millions a year with no qualifications while his dad threatens Ukraine into firing the prosecutor that was going after the power company for corruption. Come on people are you all deaf and blind? How does nobody see this as wrong? Oh, and to all those bogus accounts\channels that were created recently with little to no content just for the purpose of trying to sway peoples opinions with their comments
By the vast majority of votes
Alt "facts".
The thumbs down are multiaccounts by trump
This speach is amazing
Now I understand why this is trash.
@MoonQuartz Are you black? I am.

Wow!
I would love to see this girl honored in a super bowl in front of a worldwide audience for what she did it takes courage to do this
This was beautiful and she didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúUm‚Äù once and she only stuttered one time! I do have one question about this though‚Ä¶What does this have to do with a presidential speech, she‚Äôs talking about the past and the evolution of the world, she‚Äôs not talking about the president...Im not disrespecting her I‚Äôm just wondering how this is a presidential speech
Thoughtful question. I would say she is not there to talk about the president but about the country and the moment we are in, and the potential for growth. Personally I hope part of that growth will be that styles of performance  art rarely invited to this kind of stage will start to be invited more often. Maybe by choosing this style of performance, the event communicates an intention to improve inclusion in the country's high honors and ceremonies. (Of course leave it to Biden to allow the ceremony to be as much about us as it is about him.) Also... to take your words... It has been a while since a leader acted like **we** belong in the story of the evolution of the world. So maybe that in itself says something about him?
She's talking about the Zeitgeist. Couldn't have been more appropriate.
She is just a drama student. Any high school drama kid can deliver this. She is way too you to understand anything about what is happening in the world. The only history she know is what has been fed to her by the BLM movement.
She *WROTE* the poem. And it was brilliant.
Can these people look anymore like the elite of the movie " Hunger Games"
Wow her words touch my sole she must be very proud and confident about herself she needs to know that she has changed the world and she must give herself gratitude
Haha very funny my inner soul
Her words touch your feet?
Beautiful. Another wonderful poet like Maya. So proud of this young girl and what an inspiraci√≥n to others. Her words felt so uplifting.
Talented ..... Crown of literature is on you üíó
Phenomal young woman. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Just magic performance, Her future is already shining üåü.
From Europe: it's what we always expected from the US! Merciii!
@Reaver Red Do you know what you remind me of? An idiot Bully from these American movies. You do not know me whatsoever yet you think that you are intelligent enough to tell me to " "study History". One little advice for you: Start to contextualize your BS replies before you send them ok? Americans are nice people... But some of them are really people who did not go to school.
@Reaver Red what the F doe the Bretton Woods agreements have to do here??? Throwing any random pseudo examples out of history makes zero sense you little pretentious p-r*-k.
Pretty sure that most trump supporters dont understand a thing she‚Äôs saying lol
@Leopold P. I've noticed that most of the "insults" that conservatives/ trumpies try to get us with all have to do with mocking general intelligence, or are just blatant cussing with no actual claim or valid argument (like Ben Shapiro, lol). They'll be like "oh look, i'm a cry-baby liberal snowflake I read books, WAKE UP AMERICAüò§üá∫üá∏" ....like that's the best you can do?? is point out that I'm educated or just hit me with 5th grade insults and cuss words?? lol. Congrats graduating btw, I'm also graduating in a few months!!
Their attention span is only 10 seconds
@lil sprite dont worry i do, currently graduating in literature;)
Pretty sure you don‚Äôt either üòÇ
this is embarrassing for the republic...9th grade poetry
Powerful and eloquently delivered by a young, melinated, Princess. She mesmerized the world. I, as a WOC, felt warm tears on my face: good tears for there was a dawning of new day filled with hope. üíØ‚ù£‚ù£
I too am white and would like to show that I am one of the good ones. Unlike the barrage of supremacists who would not cry tears because they are evil. Thanks to the democrats for unifying us such that the color of our skin is of no relevance to this moment. But I am white. Just fyi
@Purplestar123 hope this helps
@Purplestar123 I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what the abbreviation actually means but if it does, it matters since people of color still face discrimination bc of their skin and women also tend to experience discrimination so I think Op wanted to highlight how important Amanda is to her and how Important the poem she spoke is important to her
@Purplestar123 wrong comment section ignore the last one
@Lobster Bread why is that important? We are all human
@Purplestar123 I‚Äôm pretty sure it means Woman of Color
wtf is a WOC
My wife and I are white, and had tears too. We have an 18 year old daughter also named Amanda, and we decided that we retroactively named her after Amanda Gorman.
Inspirational moment in history
Bravo! A poem crafted with sharp cognition and with care, recited with class and dignity and and generous humanity!! If ONLY my colleagues were on the same page with me! I watched live and so did my colleagues in the EU, China and Russia while we were simultaneously on a virtual meeting to comment real-time on the goings-on of the Inaugural. The majority of my colleagues in foreign lands was respectful towards Gorman‚Äôs poem and recitation, but they also commented that they don‚Äôt ‚Äòget‚Äô it, meaning the poem‚Äôs subject matter, the allusions and references, and her delivery of it. They were also surprised why such a young poet would be chosen. They expected a poet (like JFK‚Äôs choice of a very elderly Robert Frost) as old as Pres Biden and the senators/representatives to be up there, for gravitas and to satiate the need some people have that a poet must be ancient and must have been crafting poems for at least 50 yrs to be considered established and respected. My take was that the power of her poem is informed by allusions/references/nods to the Bible, to Slave narratives, to Whitnan, to race relations, to suppressed history, to Maya A, to J Baldwin, to LLM‚Äôs Hamilton, to recent history, to name just a few, and shaped as such for it to be gripping and quite moving and what was exactly needed for such a Special Day. I would state also that the poem and its author that day was meant not for the global audience, but strictly for the people of this republic from all political affiliations of all ages and of all gender/racial/class/ethnic expressions whom I call Americans. BUT I chose to let it go and be silent. My perplexed colleagues need to grapple with the poem and the youth of the poet on their own, and figure out why they were so resistant to what is considered to be the most dazzlingly powerful and memorable part of the Inauguration.
OMG i am in awe, this young lady blew me away
Overrated
We are now in a socialist society. YAY
That's right comrade. Nationalisation of all business begins Monday and seizing of private assets is Tuesday
As a white she wouldn't have this chance. Good to black!
we stan slam poetry at an inauguration
English please?

"A single black girl descended from slaves can find herself to be vice president." Hearing that line gives me hope for our country.
@lil sprite Can multiple things not give a person hope? Being inspired by one invent does not imply the absence of inspiration for another. Obama  Kamala can also represent multiple/different dynamics. Of course it's a beautiful thing that Obama was the first black president, and it's a beautiful thing that Kamala is the first female vice President.

@Godfrey Pigott you're killing it here, Godfrey. Keep the good work going
Because they are smarter than you, and we know they make you feel impotent.
I am wondering if America will really change. Words are easy to say, acting is sometimes very difficult. The social inequality and extreme - almost 3rd world like - poverty in America is disturbing. This can't be repaired in a few years but in can easily be worsen in the same time. But this girl is phenomenal. Great speech and her outfit is on point.

Incredible poise!
I am not even an american,but this made me cry.
Let's hope and pray Chiden and Chamala allow these words to soak into their carnal flesh. Then when they do can " unity" sprout only if they arent led by party or ruling for their party but for all sovereign Americans. If Chiden and Chamala are willing to nurture our nations fabric and truly mend our torn society than can our Nation prosper under God. Reconciliation, compromise, forgiveness patience, virtue, forgiveness, mercy, grace, compassion. Somebody step up. Our children need adults not theatre auditions. Not manipulated speeches, not discord, not division. Everyone will give an account. Know that God Almighty has your name in the book. Do not allow it to be blotted out. Take courage, fear not for God is with us. When society becomes apathetic towards moral restraints then evil rushes in and hastens our demise. Pray for our leaders whether illegitimately elected or not. Chiden and Chamala will stand individually before God and give their account. Their actions will render them guilty or innocent and determine their eternity. It's no joke. All will give an account.

Whomever disliked this video, really needs to ask themselves why they hate America.
So... If you happen to disagree with someone's views and disagree with the Democrats it means you hate America? That is ignorant group thinking. Just because you like it don't mean everybody else has to like it and if they don't like it, you're saying that person hates America?? Dumb.
She has shown no grace in victory, and no empathy for the 75 million of her fellow citizens - many of them hard working decent people - who happen to not agree with her. It‚Äôs a good speech for a Harry Potter movie
America is back...We are back baby
Quite isn't always peace I have learnt that
Beautiful in every way. I do see that thousands down-voted this. What pathetic small people you are.
Once again a dem who cannot like someone without hating someone else smh

OMG I sobbed.. How powerful. Love is our legacy. Congratulations Ms. Gorman, well deserved. Love and Light from Canada
Hahahahahahahahahhahahaaha
Oh the irony! Oh the contrast! The advert that Facebook chose to play before this wonderful poem was Nigel Farage trying to flog snake oil
Blacks won't be happy till they run this country this originally wasn't a country for everybody lmfao js the founding fathers flipped in there grave and haven't stopped for the last 100 years being American isn't this . Liberals are destroying American society watch John Wayne on liberals ... nothing else needed to be said .
John Wayne was a coward
OMG ...terrible
Racist
The clumsy cell obviously breathe because shrine emotionally invent towards a thinkable height. lowly, late credit
You can just let the melody of her voice sweep over you
There is Light! If only we are brave enough to see it! If only we are brave enough to be it!"
The most awe inspiring speech/poem that I will ever hear. What an amazing young lady. I‚Äôm not American (an Aussie) but that makes no difference; that is a speech that will resound around the world, at least I pray that it will. All the very best to you Amanda and may God bless you.
WOW is not enough to explain how incredible her speach was ....
this young lady blew me away- I was touched and proud
Only 22 and already a superstar. Bravo,

@Maja Stanojevic BAHAHAH SAME
More like a supertard
BravA
Poem? More like a high school bloger's rant.
What is with the pretentious hand movements, does she think shes bringing something new to the table? This so called poem is absolute rubbish from a 'please look at me' childish girl. Anyone who thinks otherwise has never read quality poetry. This is another box ticking exercise from Creepy Uncle Joe.
Then after that they all went to the white house basement with Bidddenns and rested.
Foh .....propaganda
Wow.. fabulous.. Wow.
Truly excellent.
corruption. America is becoming more and more like CHina. America wants to turn China into a democratic country. But China has turned America into a country like China. So sad.
How is this like China?
Beautiful ‚ù§ Tears in my eyes ü•∫
Love you all, please be safe and let's come together to make America great for the first time ever. Try at least w/o the hate rascism division we're much more together. Powerful together we're brave enough to be it
Ashli Babbit deserved it.
This is what democracy sounds like... beautiful
She's a great public speaker with so much passionüòò
@Reaver Red rightüòä lets see whats next for her in the coming months and years
üíû
Amazing......enough said....
By the sound of this the past 4 years were horrible for all those poor minorities! Good thing those death camps finally closed down and all those vile racists defeated!
A most remarkable young lady telling the world and not just America the right way to live ...I felt Amanda‚Äôs message was going to be sensational and powerful the first few seconds she started to speak...Truly a poem like no other ....
This is pretty damn good
AWWW man i have to analyze this poem for ss D;
i sux at poems
pls someone do this for me ;(
What do you think the title of the poem ‚ÄúThe Hill We Climb‚Äù means? What is the theme or universal message of ‚ÄúThe Hill We Climb‚Äù? Name 3 interesting parts in the poem and explain. Do you think as a society we still have a hill to climb? Explain.
FLAWLESS
Yo is this guy obama?

Move over Francis scott-key. Should be publicly recited at every national event, as much as. Nation anthem.
Can she be in charge of the planet please!
She is awesome üòç
Noted: the two republicans checking their phones while this young woman brings a nation together. You two are pure human garbage.
Also noted, one Democrat on her phone only one minute into Biden's speech. Lady in green coat and thick framed glasses. Pure hot garbage.
@Aitch Channel seeing if their pals had been caught after helping them in a coup
Who knows why they checked? They could have been waiting on important family news. Please don't judge.
Yuck.
A-man-duh gore-man.
Racist
Yuck? You seem like a miserable person.
Just the power this girl holds now
This was a very nice speech to listen to. Such feeling. It's art.
Wow
Reminds me of Langston Hughes and it gives me chills. I love this.
Chills may be from all that bbc u been eatin n all that crack you been smokin
How wonderful and Everything she is! So happy to live for this.
Mitch McConnell, Gym Jordan, Devin Nunez and a host of other Trump acolytes were scratching their heads and asking, "What the heck was she talking about?"
exactly: "Talented Angel you are definitely showing off your ancestry coming from a line of kings, queens, emperors, chiefs and pharaohs. Standing out like no other. Keep it up!"
Kings etc are the oppressors.
Nope
Yes
At the end of the day words are just words...but your money where your mouths are chumps
Wowww all Americans bee living and peacefully an one love and God save all Americans peoples ind this world üôè
What a far cry from "fire and fury and American Carnage."
Yall keep selling that Kamala Harris is black  then want to complain why colorism in the Black community exists lol classic
Who is disliking this??
"But one thing is certain - if we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy, and change, our children's birthright."
True
"Victory won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made." "Because being American is more than a pride we inherit - it's the past we step into, and how we repair it."
That is not poetry, it's rubbish. AA rubbish.
Racist
Incredible
Absolutely good. While a minister is somewhere in Cameroon saying boyses in the bushes and how the government intend to help the fambilies to bury the bereaved

Rich child of rich parents rehearses elementary grade page comprised entirely of platitudes and regurgitates them to other rich people. Please clap
@Yash200 Wzee As I live in the UK, we have been kept blissfully unaware of the tent cities on the Mexican border. This is the first I've seen of it. Disgraceful.
@Yash200 Wzee Very interesting article about Tiger. Thanks for that. I live in the UK and that whole segregation thing in the US during the 40's/50's made me sick. I could never understand what all that was about. I lived and worked in the US for 9 years in the 80''s/90's and things seemed to be fine back then. I remember working with colleagues of all races, religion and sexual preference, and we all got along famously. There was no discrimination in the workplace. What's happened since then? The rich seem to have become obscenely rich under both political parties, and globalization hasn't helped the average man in the street.
She was raised by a single mother, a middle school teacher in Watts. She was awarded the Milken Family Foundation college scholarship and then attended Harvard. Oh yes, middle school teachers may be dedicated and rich in pride but not wealthy.
@Harry Callahan You mentioned Tiger Woods did okay? His racism and b i g o t r y battle https://www.todaysgolfer.co.uk/features/player-features/2020/june/tiger-woods-racism/
@Harry Callahan First you need to do your research because there are other races moreso receiving aid from the State than african-americans, so stop stereotyping. Further, you will never face what a person of color faces day to day. People go thru struggles yes, but it is moreso with certain races. Sure people do get ahead when they work hard, however people of color have to work 3x as hard to get the same things out of life. That's just a fact. It should not be this way is my point as EVERYONE should be treated equal. It is wrong, just admit it. Racism is still alive in the US where it does not belong here, and we have seen more examples of this during Trump's time in office. Biden and Harris has a better agenda to tackle these issues, is another one of my points. We ALL know that this was not God's plan and He wanted better for us all.
@Yash200 Wzee By sheer accident of birth, I was born a white person and I find the term 'white privilege' offensive. I was in no way privileged and had to work hard for everything I have. I did not rely on government handouts. America is a dog-eat-dog society and it is unrealistic to expect the State to provide a great quality of life for everyone. Socialist ideals dis-incentivise the populace, and lead to mediocrity. Who do you think is going to pay for your utopian vision?
@Harry Callahan Interesting as well.....relating to the homeless. How would Trump or Biden approach housing and homelessness? You are right, just shameless https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-17/trump-biden-housing-homelessness-policy
@Harry Callahan Education is the key. Biden and Harris understands this which is why they are targeting ALL zipcodes by providing better resources, funding and staff for daycare centers, preschools, elementary school, middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities. They go even further with entrepreneur and business programs. This includes having safer neighborhoods and communtiy services as well, again No matter the Zipcode.
@Harry Callahan You do understand that: 1) 'Every one' is not treated equal nor do they have the same opportunities to get ahead like others right? 2) Systemic Inequality (Displacement, Exclusion, and Segregation) and Oppression is real 3) 'White privilege' is real 4) Bullies are real (whether hidden or out in the open) 5) FBI Director said last year that white nationalist groups are the gravest threat to the US, and Trump tried to fire? 6) White supremacist and devil worshipers all support Trump as well Again this is not the 1800's. I am going to reference another post: He (Trump who was the Leader of the Free World) publicly and consistently supports confederate symbolism, however he dismisses the fact that there is still 'white privilege as he is the perfect example exhibit A. Nor will he publicly acknowledge that systematic racism still exists (even though he did so on tape: https://youtu.be/Fx7BIhp2zuE / https://youtu.be/8651KlgwLnU), and he certainly has not publicly acknowledged that the underbelly and foundational growth of America, and it‚Äôs economy, was built on the backs of african americans for free, and with no education, no wealth, no statutes.
@Harry Callahan That's not what I meant. The point I was making is, this is 2021, not the 1800's. Our culture is changing. Younger Generation is much smarter and wiser than the Older Generation and they are not having it. They will be our next Democrats and Republicans. All should be treated equal and All should have the same opportunities in the United States of America without interference. Biden is with that as well. *But if you would like to share info on 'tent cities' did you mean this as well?* https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/trump-admin-s-tent-cities-cost-more-keeping-migrant-kids-n884871
@hello2020 hello Sometimes, when in a position of authority, one has to make unpopular decisions that won't please everyone. I don't agree with Kamala's idea to legalise cannabis because I think it will lead young people to try harder things, and cause havoc on the roads. She must have read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World where they used SOMA to control the masses.
@foreal foreal Tiger Woods has done OK.
@foreal foreal I think it's time people of color stopped making an issue of discrimination and racism as the vast majority of white people are not racist or discriminatory. If people, especially in the USA, are willing to work hard and take advantage of the opportunities available to them, then anyone, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation can make a success of their life. Stop making excuses and rise above the blame culture. Of course, the pandemic doesn't help matters, but all the more reason for people to work together.
@Yash200 Wzee I think I'm well up on the news. Shameful https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-12-23/in-pandemic-americas-tent-cities-a-grim-future-grows-darker https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/what-will-the-biden-administration-do-about-homelessness-and-will-it-help-seattle/ Let's see what Biden does to solve this problem.
@foreal foreal Did you hear about Hank Aaron? He was incredible, an elite hall of famer and such a sweet and kind man. He broke Babe Ruth's Home run recod while subjected to racist abuse and threats. He had so much class when dealing with it too.
@foreal foreal Something about the struggles in life that makes one rise even higher. God's plan is always on point. Right, He intended us all to love, work and live together towards prosperity and success from the beginning of time. Unity is great. Loving President Biden and Vice President Harris.
@Harry Callahan see you are not up on current events cozybear.
@hello2020 hello he lost by a landslide too.... the people spoke. simple and worth repeating "The state of this country   Trump = Why Biden won. God is with Biden, so are the courts, and so are The People.
@Wew Lad thought so. lol
‚Äã@foreal foreal hey....a talented Angel is definitely showing off her ancestry coming from a line of kings, queens, emperors, chiefs and pharaohs. Standing out like no other.
@foreal foreal The fact is the ruling elite, be they Republican or Democrat is made up of a loose affiliation of billionaires and multi-millionaires who don't really give a rats about the struggles of the working class and are quite prepared to let the homeless live in tent cities under motorways. Shameful.
@Yash200 Wzee yawn
@hello2020 hello yeah just shaking my head. glad he is gone.
@Yash200 Wzee Yeah. A Harvard Grad from LA raised by a single mother who was a teacher. Her and her twin sister were also born as a preemies. While growing up, she struggled with a speech impediment and auditory processing issues where she fell in love with words and poetry in the third grade. She used writing and recited poetry as a form of speech pathology for her. Just amazing. Some still don't get the point of what she was trying to express. I saw this quote from her: ‚ÄúIn my poem, I‚Äôm not going to in any way gloss over what we‚Äôve seen over the past few weeks and, dare I say, the past few years,‚Äù Gorman told The New York Times ahead of the inauguration. ‚ÄúBut what I really aspire to do in the poem is to be able to use my words to envision a way in which our country can still come together and can still heal. It‚Äôs doing that in a way that is not erasing or neglecting the harsh truths I think America needs to reconcile with.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one ... There is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.‚Äù Then also Obama states: "On a day for the history books, @TheAmandaGorman delivered a poem that more than met the moment. Young people like her are proof that "there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it; if only we're brave enough to be it."
@Wew Lad There are always those bullies who want to step on others to try and keep them down. Merriam-Webster has a new definition of ‚Äúracism" where Racism and Systemic Oppression go hand in hand which is still happening today. On another note as they are speaking on the issues with regard to 'filibuster" within the news, I found it interesting that Obama called filibuster the 'Jim Crow relic' that should be eliminated if necessary to enact voting rights legislation.
@foreal foreal That list is crazy. Sad for him. He also has those white nationalist groups espouse white supremacist or white separatist ideologies and devil worshipers that supports him too, but not Biden. Geee wonder why that is? God don't like ugly hearts either.
@foreal foreal wow, tl;dr. My point is she's talking about slavery when her own race created a slave empire in Libya. That is literally my point. Slavery is not a problem in the US anymore. It hasn't been for hundreds of years, yet people still talk about it as if it's a scourge.
@foreal foreal preach!!! amen.
@foreal foreal omg that list is just shameful. That's why he lost.
@Harry Callahan Sorry for the rude awakening, but ALL black people (people of color) have experinced some form of racism or discrimination throughout their lives. Especially those who strive to reach higher and higher. Guess it intimidates some. Biden and Harris has a plan for that too.
@Wew Lad Was not speaking about slaves. hmmm....interesting you bought that up. But ok, lets start here and look at this list below on the former President's racist history. I saw this in another response regarding T R U M P and you can google the facts yourself as well: "So I viewed this list as well as what the Bible says about such things, and the vote decision was very easy: #1 In the 70‚Äôs He discriminated against black tenants #2 In the 80‚Äôs He called for death penalty for Central Park 5 #3 in the 90‚Äôs He was fined for discriminating against black employees #4 in 2005 He pitched version of ‚ÄúApprentice‚Äù blacks vs. whites #5 In 2011 He pushed Obama birther conspiracy #6 In 2015 He called for Muslum ban #7 In 2016 He claimed hispanic judges couldn‚Äôt be impartial Again re: border wall - he called mexican people as drug dealers, criminals, rapists. Unlike any other administration, he put in place a widespread and systematic 'zero tolerance' policy to prosecute and criminally charge everyone who crosses the border without inspection which was meant to deter migrants from seeking refuge in the U.S - caging children and separating them from their parents. #8 In 2016 He refused to condemn former KKK Leader Duke #9 In 2017 He said ‚Äòfine people‚Äô on both sides in Charlottesville - white supremacist. This year he made statements to Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by. FBI and Homeland Security said WS was the gravest threat to US. #10 In 2017 Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria - 13 days after he then visited. Mayor says he was "insulting" to the island's hurricane-hit people. He tossed rolls of paper towels into the crowds. Words stated were 'poor and dirty' #11 in 2018 He called NFL players protesting police brutality ‚Äòsons of b's‚Äô #12 in In 2018 He referred to Haiti and African nations as ‚Äòs-hole‚Äô countries #13 In 2020 he calls Covid-19 the ‚ÄòChinaVirus‚Äù and ‚ÄúKungFlu‚Äô (even though we all know who‚Äôs name should be associated with Covid as now within the US alone 24,673,298 cases / 411,426 deaths where he stated on woodward tapes https://youtu.be/HJkVOs0s3mw way early last year, it was more dangerous than the flu, but lied to our faces and downplaying it) #14 In 2020 he targets to disenfranchise legal votes within the largest cities that are heavily democratic with a majority people of color, while ignoring heavily white areas of the country, is evident and sends a bad message regarding voter suppression and inequity. # 15 In 2020, although his mother is from Scotland, he suggested Sen. Kamala Harris is not a US Citizen - did the same with Obama. #16 In 2020 he worked to stop diversity training at federal agencies #17 In 2020 he worked to roll back fair housing rule to ‚Äòsave suburbs‚Äù #18 He defends Confederate flag despite Pentagon ban. #19 He threaten to pull funding from schools over how they teach black history slavery which is part of a long history of politicizing american history class. #20 He says he does not know who the 'proud boys' are. He pardoned Roger Stone who worked with him, who has also been photographed with proud boys. #21 His own father was arrested at a K K K rally and got off from charges with his money. #22 His own sister and niece said so, along with a growing list of dems and reps government officials, civil rights icons, as well as respected news journalists - stating racist, bully, cheater, liar, culture war stoker, divider, etc‚Ä¶. Their interview tapes are all over youtube. # 23 He did not put immediate laws in place to uproot racist corrupt officers (who he says there are only a few bad apples), as they don't deserve to work alongside our wonderful police officers who took their vows seriously to serve and protect EVERYONE no matter their race and background) 24 He publicly and consistently supports confederate symbolism, however he dismisses the fact that there is still 'white privilege as he is the perfect example exhibit A. Nor will he publicly acknowledge that systematic racism still exists (even though he did so on tape https://youtu.be/Fx7BIhp2zuE / https://youtu.be/8651KlgwLnU), and he certainly has not publicly acknowledged that the underbelly and foundational growth of America, and it‚Äôs economy, was built on the backs of african americans for free, and with no education, no wealth, no statutes. # 25 He does not seem to separate good from bad. There are millions of peaceful protesters merging every race and backgrounds imaginable madeup of Americans who have been largely unaware of black history, now joined with those Americans who have known the history all along, or just lives it - ALL standing up for justice and equality for all (including black lives). And of course you will have those opposite opposing sides all with the intent to cause confusion and encourage violence as they exploit, capitalize and undermine legitimate peaceful protests. Either they 1) believe EVERYONE should NOT be treated equally, or 2) Have their OWN groups' agenda. That would include white supremacy and other hate groups disgnated by The Southern Poverty Law, looters, drug cartels, arsonist, foreign actors or anarchists. Although police forces, national guards and FBI continue to investigate these groups and FBI states that WS groups is the gravest threat to our nation, that‚Äôs not forget how trump calls some ‚Äòvery fine people.‚Äô #26 He attempted to stoke fear and racial divisions, even in his housing and suburban messages, where he pleaded with suburban white voters, including moms, to vote for them - who obviously leaned towards Biden https://youtu.be/Ey2xgKSXbF / https://youtu.be/0Cf63gkpp5k / https://youtu.be/JVde8wmF02g #27 It seems as though he is trying to undo everything that civil rights icons have accomplished - trying to turn the clock back 125 years. Now that the two senators in GA won, Unlike Biden who will control the senate, everyone knows that there were those within the White House that refused to compromise with any of the Obama administration‚Äôs priorities in his first two years making it harder for him to get things done (Here is just one example - look at reps reaction when he fights for us back in 2013). https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/02/06/trump-democrats-treasonous-unamerican-sotu-obama-republicans-bts-ac.cnn However despite that, he has many accomplishments while in office - look them up. Instead of trump turning the clocks back of what has been accomplished, the Obama era will continue with the Biden/Harris agenda for all cultures and backgrounds towards building back better. They are for red and blue states, for everyone's well-being who should have great health, happiness, and prosperity no matter the zip code. All should have a right to wealth and success, not just certain areas or certain people within this country. Biden/Harris calls for SAFETY in all neighborhoods: * Great policemen who are well trained and loves all people, and adding more professionals to their staff so they can be even greater at their jobs to serve and protect. And immediately uproot and remove corrupt cops lurking about with their own hidden agendas. * Top quality and guaranteed affordable healthcare, doctors, treatments, including mental health. * Top education STARTING in Nursery schools and PRE K all the way up through COLLEGE GRADUATION - Schools housed with well trained teachers and staff who receive the kind of pay they deserve, teaching wide-ranging curriculum and expanding clubs. * Low cost or free for TOP colleges and universities of choice (as other countries are doing). * Top quality housing and neighborhood maintenance * Roadmap aims to create a new, federally-backed credit bureau to close the racial wealth gap * Better qualifying home ownership programs with freedom of choice communities. * Community town hall services, activities and parks * More jobs (not low minimum wage either) with competitive salaries and guaranteed growth potential * On-the-job training with pay. * Affordable and universal preschool, child care and elder care. * Entrepreneurship programs with mentorship tools, startup capital for new business, guides for business leadership programs who can turn an idea into entrepreneurial success. * The leadership and resources to do the things that other countries have done to end this pandemic. Now in US alone 24,673,298 cases / 411,426 deaths - which are affecting people of color more. And there is much more with Biden/Harris 2020 and their tight agenda. "
@Wew Lad Yes I agree. Her diatribe sounded awfully dark to me, and has definitely been influenced by a fanatical feminist.
@foreal foreal That doesn't answer the fact that she seems to have been born into a life of privilege and is not representative of the down trodden working classes as she would have us believe.
‚Äã@Harry Callahan OK I can agree on that. Her mother filled her with rhetoric at a young age about how dangerous it is a black person in America. She's a victim of multiple things.
@Wew Lad You can't blame her for being youthful, idealistic and naive. It's the democratic Party leadership that have shamelessly exploited her in order to appear as if they care about working class and poverty.
‚Äã@foreal foreal did God approve of Obama's slave market in Libya?
@Wew LadWell, some people will never be able to relate on her level, or comprehend her kind of talent. She is art. Some people are also unable to appreciated art primarily for it's beauty or emotional power. On another note. You have to be growing a personal relationship with God to go beyond what you actually see.
@Harry Callahan Obama Administration did start the free tuition community college. Biden is offering something even better starting in pre-schools up thru college. Futher it is interesting that some of the richest countrys in the world offer free college for its citizens. This young lady is so talented and polished, she obviously received scholarships and mentorship throughout her educational life to get her going.
@Harry Callahan because she isn't being sincere, she is an actor. There is literally no difference to Bruce Willis playing John McCain in Die Hard and this person pretending to care about poor people or slavery when her own government created a slave market in Libya under... guess who.
It just shows the insincerity of the Democratic party. She is not an atypical daughter of an inner city low income single mother. Somehow she managed to go to a private school in Santa Monica with tuition fees of $34K to $42K pa. How are poor kids, regardless of their ethnicity, supposed to afford an education like that in her vision of the New World?
Is it just me or is she copying MLK way of speaking while giving a speech
It‚Äôs a way of speaking used by people giving public poetry or speeches that allows you to hear each word individually and clearly.
she will be hyped by the media and the left for the next 16 years, until she will run as a candidate for the presidency in 2036 and be elected. without any economic or political knowledge, she will become president of the usa. a good writer, but ultimately only one whose topics are also limited to race, skin color, feminism and activism. Just being able to speak well is not enough to rule a nation of 330 million people. she will be 38 years old in 16 years and her skin color will be the reason why she becomes president, but not her qualifications.
@T. Williams oh ok, I don't know her poetry, but as the Havard graduate that she is, I assumed she was outstanding.
This is at least the fifth times I've listened to this poem in its entirety in two days, not to mention all the times its has been cut into other shows.
Beautiful and Touching
did you guys know she has a speech disorder
And where is the music? I was thinking was a song..... Nice girl üòç‚ù§üòò
Thank you Amanda for putting perfect words and beautiful voice to the feelings of millions. Thank you.
Keep that dream! You may be a future president! :)
I'M LOST FOR WORDS....YOU ARE AWSOME!!!!(QUEEN)!
Hey look more virtue signaling from the left
Hey look more crying conservatives
Woooow so powerful
why does this poem remind me of Lin-Manuel Miranda
As an artist, I genuinely wish for more artists and people like her to be in positions of power, or at least have a seat at the table. I know so many highly intelligent artists that lead from the heart and think so uniquely that they would add so much light, wisdom and fresh forward thinking to a government. Artists aren‚Äôt made the most of in our culture.

Get ready for Jobs to go down, crimes to go up, taxes for the middle class to go up, that line of taxing the Rich more never happens, wall street  big corporations own China Joe. Minimum wage will not go up to $15, if it does it will close millions of businesses..yeah great economic plan..üòí Biden is destroying the best economy ever because he's a liar  fraud. Watch and see, what President Trump said will happen, don't be surprised with the next year if our kids are in another useless war again getting killed for the crooks to get richer. Biden supporters are racist useful idiots just like the poor excuse for news CNN  MSNBC, the left not liberals, liberals have some sense, but the extreme left will be coming for those clowns in the media who think if they "carry water" they'll be safe. Check history, power  control hungry losers get to each other eventually.
Is that your attempt at a poem? It was a bit Beat but bad. Made no sense so nice try
Our hoods are still broken...
She is beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
When day comes, we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast. We‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace, and the norms and notions of what ‚Äújust‚Äù is isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried. That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare. It‚Äôs because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. This effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked, ‚ÄòHow could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?‚Äô now we assert, ‚ÄòHow could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?‚Äô We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change, our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the west. We will rise from the wind-swept north-east where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked south. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover. In every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country, our people, diverse and beautiful, will emerge, battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
Beautiful words from a beautiful person :')
Ted Nugent wrote Joe Biden a letter via Facebook moments ago and it is going viral fast. Just in case it is censored, here it is in it‚Äôs entirety. -üá∫üá∏Dear Vice President Biden, Although I refused to listen to it, I understand that during your presidential acceptance speech, you were calling for the unity of Trump supporters. I remember four years ago my President Trump also called for unity. I remember how Congressional members of your Democratic Party responded by boycotting his inauguration. I remember how you and your Democratic party cheated and used the greatest law enforcement institution of this country to spy on my President Trump's campaign. I remember how you and your Democratic Party created a fake Russian dossier to try and impeach my President Trump. I remember how your speaker of the house ripped up my President Trump's beautiful State of the Union speech on National TV. I remember how you and your Democratic Party tried to impeach my President Trump over a Ukraine phone call. You accused my President Trump of pay to play. Come to find out Joe, it was really you and your son Hunter. I remember how you and your Democratic Party blamed my President Trump over a pandemic that he had nothing to do with. I remember how you and your Democratic Party encouraged rioting and looting of my great United States of America. I remember how you and your Democratic Party used the media to spread lie after lie about my President Trump. I remember how you and your Democratic Party stole the election from my President Trump. This Trump supporter remembers all that Joe, and will NOT be unifying with your Democratic Party. Your abject criminal dishonesty is treasonous. You belong in prison along with the rest of the Swamp. Ted Nugent ""üá∫üá∏

Or perhaps the issue is your capacity to understand.

America's greatness is being like an ocean. Like ocean is the ultimate destination of all rivers of the world. America is the ultimate future model for all nations of the world. America is the future. Tyrants and nationalist and extremists will fall and forgotten. America will remain ....Great.
Amanda, you are a gift to the country and the world.
Right concepts, mediocre poetry.
Where is your version?
Wow üíØ I've watch her 10 times.
Feel privileged to have witnessed this , so full of love , feeling and emotion by a wonderful human being , your mother has done a fantastic job raising you and must be so proud of you , let‚Äôs hope this is the new beginning for the USA after four years of hate and divisions
Sollte ich diese geniale junge Dame einmal pers√∂nlich kennen lernen, w√ºrde ich ihre schmalen H√§nde in meine alten H√§nde nehmen und versuchen zu erf√ºhlen, wie es sein kann, dass sie mit diesen H√§nden sprechen kann. Das habe ich am meisten an ihrer Darbietung bewundert: ihre sprechenden H√§nde, die ihre Worte erst vollkommen machten. Ich freue mich auf die n√§chste Begegnung mit ihr. Die USA, das reiche Land, haben einen weiteren Schatz geschenkt bekommen.
Awesome and healing enlightenment across the board of humanity
Beautiful in every sense of the word. How proud Americans should feel at this young lady!
why would people downvote this smh
Wonderful!
She makes me proud to be an American.
worth a nobel price
if one is worth of a nobel price ; she's the one
This is not poetry, if poetry is defined as heightened language. Gorman's phrasing is prosaic, although she is fond of plays on words ("justice" and "just us," "arms" as armaments and arms reaching out). The last time a poem was read at an inaugural was 30 years ago, when Maya Angelou read at Bill Clinton's, and prior to that, it was 30 years earlier when Robert Frost read at JFK's. I can only conclude that Gorman was selected because she wouldn't upstage Biden's own speech. There's also a lot here that I can only call "trolling the conservatives," to send the message that the liberals are in charge now and they're going to have to listen to our concerns.
Perfect!

Amen
This woman is superpowerful. This is real life. Life is challenges and twist and turns. Help all hate none. Peace
Whilst, we have our eyes on the future, the future has its eyes on us. Wow, that's a powerful, " Democracy can be delayed but ca never be defeated" if that Josh Hawley, Cruz and Trump have only known that their dishonesty is going to be forever written in the history books....

What's with all the dislikes, must be jealousy.
@LH SD I do think some of the hate has to do with race because a lot of the positive comments have race discussions beneath them. Although I agree with a lot of what you're saying, you're perpetuating it and also creating an incentive for the topic to be about her race rather than her performance, see how easy it is. Regardless, people use labels and groups because it makes them feel special and validated to be apart of something, especially if that's a victimised group. So, it's not just Democrats its everyone, this is coming from a trump supporter.

Your poem is a hammer falling like a feather straight into our hearts giving us relief awakening from that nightmare of hatred
Who is here bc their teachers sent them here | | |
I think her poem is technically quite good. Aside from my political beliefs. I was dreading Rupi Quar rubbish (not poetry). Only thing was the self indulgence was a little too much, ebbs of my ego apparent. Not a lot of metaphorical meaning, likely as it was more of a speach. Which is okay. Nice timbre/rhyme, structure and meter. I think she did a decent job.
speach?
So Biden is for blacks, unlike Trump who properly funded their colleges and was helping them, with Ben Carson, work their way out of poverty. "If you don't vote democrat you ain't black ", said Biden. Thomas Sowell is right about the problems of poverty and the democrats have no policies that work in this regard.
@Michael Lewis But we all won against the ultimate cheater, liar, and narcissist-in chief. Also, your phrase, "so Biden is for blacks" sounds so bizarre. It smacks of jealousy.
@Composer Guy I wouldn't mind losing fairly but not to a cheat.
Sore loser.

I'm almost 80 years old, but hearing this speech I could not keep back my tears.
@N in other words you don‚Äôt believe that experience is the best teacher, therefore you should respect that teacher and no speak loosely because you think you superior
@RamanMan97 i don‚Äôt agree with orion, but respecting your elders is the dumbest thing i‚Äôve ever heard. it‚Äôs useless too
@Whereyouabouts ToBe Me too! It was self servicing bs! Slam poetry used to be about many different subjects now it‚Äôs all about race and women‚Äôs rights! With their fake outrage! All of it had the same cadence and delivery!
You‚Äôre getting soft on us old man. This writing was pure trash!
Hello üëãüëã
@orionh3000 hey gen z go to hell
orionh3000 play in traffic
@orionh3000 I was smiling at this comment until you showed up
@Satwik Mishra IF you have a problem figuring out whether you're going to vote for me or Donald Trump then you aren't black... Your President Joe Biden ü•¥
You and me both. I am 58 years old and was a great admirer of the great poets. One such was the late great Maya Angelou. Amanda Gorman in her short young life put into words and emotions, with her voice tones and inflections everything that was needed and more at just the right moment at this time and place. It was all this and powerful but so much more. I could never in my life find the appropriate words to show how much I appreciated just hearing her speak. This is how her words moved me. Some people in a million years, Mr, Griesang, will never ever understand no matter what the circumstances are what it is to be a true human being. This means accepting of all and everything, also seeing the beauty in all, any and everything in this world. I will leave it all at that. Take care, my friend, your life is just fine and right.
@orionh3000 how is watching a video on YouTube at whatever age equated to not having a life ? What's the difference if he's watching TV or YouTube? You wouldn't be saying this if he was watching TV. The difference is he can watch whatever he wants on YouTube so what's ur problem?
@Reaver Red you've had the weirdest comments in this comment section. You think you're a super smart one huh? Already figured life out smh.
@orionh3000 LMFAOOOOOO
@orionh3000 orionh, your telling Risto to get a life. You should get a life, talking trash to 80 year olds on the internet means you have no life. And those other 9 people who liked his comment, your just sad and pathetic. Trust me, you are
@orionh3000 dont u got yo 7 times tables to do?
@orionh3000 hey gen z, get a life
@orionh3000 did writing a mean youtube comment to a nice 80 year old man make you feel better
@orionh3000 A boomer has had a life. He or she, can talk about their emotions, yes? That you had to put your soiled paws on a beautiful post just reveals that you are a basement dweller. Super Mario forever!!!!!!
@hey there you totally missed the point didn't you? How about you stick to tiktok?
Do 80 year olds not cry? Lol
@orionh3000 bro what the actual fkkk. Respect your elders idiot. Did you think that was a funny comment or something
@orionh3000 you can't even read a sentence. Go cry in the corner with Donald Dump
@orionh3000 hi gen XY, go to hell
how is this a poem it dont rhyme

If we merge mercy with might and might with right then LOVE becomes our legacy......... Wow!
laydown ur weapons and knee to the government who need not to be a justice one
Even with such beautiful messages of hope... THEY still only see and hear evil in this intelligent poet. How can someone dislike this effort to heal through spoken words of encouragement to the broken and downtrodden people of the land? Yet THEY cheered during these last 4 years of vile distasteful political rhetoric, hyperbole, deceit, and murder. How refreshing to see classy and inclusive demonstrations again instead of smutty tyranny. To those who may hate the fact that your "Merica" is once again progressing towards actually striving to BE The UNITED States of America... full of Liberty and Justice for ALL not just the colonialist that love to pillage and destroy those who appear different. Such primitive minds. If only they paid attention in biology and chemistry.... it would possibly be apparent that we all have more in common than different. I cannot wait until bigotry is extinct.
WOW!!!!!!! There's nothing I can write here that can top the beauty  eloquence of that poetry  deep sentiment. üíõüíõüíõ
Same blabber jabber just said differently üòí
She was amazing. As a fellow poet,I am proud of her.The words that she spoke were brilliantly expressed from her heart for the whole world to listen.I want to share something with everyone.I am a poet and a writer.I am a first time self-published author of a poetry book. Here is a link to my poetry book Www.amazon.com/the-write-house-edwin-hurdle/dp/1432704613 Her future is very bright and I wish her all the best
Her mouth, lip, tongue, eyes, hands all organs recited smoothly, brightly and confidently like the glittering pearls.
Amazing, non pareil and deeply touching.
GO SIS!
Such an inspiration! Love it
Simply brilliant!
Imagine all the English, social study, history, political science  drama teachers in this country making a point to have their highshool, middle school, and even elementary students watching and studying this poem and performance, Amanda have just single handedly recuites and coverts a full generation of future voters and electorates for the democrats party. The Republican party is screwed!

Man let me tell you something. You have no appreciation for the real things in life. Maybe you should reflect to see what makes you act this way. You should have hope for a better tomorrow.
Wow... to me this summarises the massive shift underway in the US political landscape. America is gonna go from Donald Trump, the apologist for alt-right racists, to www.woke.com. Crazy really.

Her words we're beautiful, but because of her overdone gestures and facial expressions, it partly loses it's power. (Not for everyone but for me, nowadays people love extravagance because otherwise they can't feel it anymore because of an overload of video's, speeches, news... She's a good writer, not that good of a speech. If you look to Rev Beamans speech, he just tells his speech with confidance, without need of overacted gestures.

‚ù§
FULL LYRICS: When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast. We‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace. In the norms and notions of what just is isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow, we do it. Somehow, we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so, we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew; that even as we hurt, we hoped; that even as we tired, we tried; that we‚Äôll forever be tied together victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in in all of the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it. Because being American is more than a pride we inherit; it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, that would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can periodically be delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared in its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked: ‚ÄúHow can we possibly prevail over catastrophe?‚Äù Now we assert: ‚ÄúHow could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?‚Äù We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised, but whole; benevolent, but bold; fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation, because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burden. But one thing is certain: if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze, pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the West. We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sunbaked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
@Adam Wintetbottom its okay ot happens God bless
@Mac Gregory tired of people sorry
@Adam Wintetbottom chill

Thanks for posting the poem. But you know we are going to sow division once again. It's gonna happen.
Two things: It isn't "lyrics", as it isn't a song. Somebody else posted the poem in an easier to read, line by line format as it should be read or spoken. That said, it is a beautiful poem, written by and beautifully orated by a talented young lady.

I came here because I am compelled to say that this is some of the most brilliant, perfect spoken word poetry I have ever been privileged to witness. This exceptionally gifted, intelligent young woman's oratory skills are on par with every single public speaker that has ever lived. Her compelling presence and utter confidence, her hands moving gracefully as they frame her powerful ideas...one is compelled to hang on every word and the meaning behind them. I had no hope for the education of the lost Covid generation, left behind by the atrociously weak attempt labeled "distance learning"... This beautiful, brilliant, eloquent young lady has single handedly restored that hope. üôè I predict that this old soul/young woman is about to embark on a shining, streaking career arc over us all...and we are all better for her presence in the world. Preach it, little sister! Never be silenced! And.. thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüí™üé§

Neat poem. I liked it. Nice delivery to.
Well said and spoken buy not much rhymed. NO ONE CLICKED BUT I really love the passion well done.
I appreciate the sentiments, but I don't find the delivery particularly poetic.
amanda is such a force of light. everything about this poem is high vibrational. The beauty and painful truth in this speech is so powerful. children for years to come will study this poem.
The Americans should unite and fight the evil CCP together, not just focusing on these shallow leftist rituals, which serve no practical effects to this country.
Wow... this girl...
And of course nothing she said relates to what will now happen, or has happened.
I think she should be hired as speech writer! It's a long way to a possible president run in 2036 but it's a good start for her ...

Black girl reading a poem,Black vice president But still blacks still cry and whine never stop complaining about how racist this country is. ü§î
@lovely people She is a "Talented Angel who is definitely showing off her ancestry coming from a line of kings, queens, emperors, chiefs and pharaohs. Standing out like no other."
@Martin Martins You are really behind on black history regarding those who have stood out and accomplished so much whether they are Presidents, Vice Presidents, government officials, doctors, politicians, professors, attorneys, inventors, scientists, entreprenuers, etc. A few individuals, really? lol. And, yes, African Americans may not have had the headstart like White Americans had at first where their ancestors were bullied and helped build this country, but things do change and African Americans are making progress. It is 2021 not the 1600's. On another note: All human beings emerged and originated from Africa. Further, Kamala Harris has always embraced her black and asian heritage (jamiacan and indian). Do your research. She has always been introduced as Black and South Asian so you may want to read up on history to figure out what that means.
@lovely people pointing out a few individuals who have been pushed into the spotlight does not signify the emergence of your false utopia. I thought Kamala was the first Indian Senate member some years ago? Interesting that her ethnicity changes depending on what narrative is being told. You're literally just pointing out situations in which people are obtaining positions based solely on ethnicity and no other merit. Good job. And most of Bidens team are juice. So diverse!
@Martin Martins sweetie, it already has landed. Feast your eyes on exhibit A, this video. She is an overnight success and in such a positive light. And there are plenty more Amanda Gorman's coming. lol. nice try though. You do know we have a half black/asian VP right? Oh by the way, have you taken a peek at Biden's cabinet picks? Cuture is changing dude. Get used to it. I will be voting for Ms. Gorman when she runs.
@lovely peopleLmao. I'm sorry to tell you but the goofy fantasy land you described will never exist. And you realize the people storming the capitol were not the youth right? The leftoids burning cities all year were much younger than the capitol folks. You have failed at turning that one around. Lol nice try, though. Also keep repeating that objectively untrue "younger and wiser" generation nonsense. Is humorous.
@Martin Martins Sorry to tell you honey there are loads of 'Amanda Gormans' walking around (talented beyond some people's comprehension) coming in all races and walks of life. These people are the younger wiser generation that will make a great difference to this country who knows their God given purpose. Another example, young and 'changed for the better' Republicans will be joining young and stronger Democrats to lead this country to an even better USA for ALL. *Now as far as the others you are describing, unfornately yes, there will be the small percentage of youth following in their mentors foot steps who feel that storming the capital and attacking people is the only way to get their sick way*
@lovely people Mostly young people. Yes, the hilariously indoctrinated youth. The ones eating tide pods and unable to decide which bathroom to use while suffering from depression and other mental illness in increasingly high numbers. God is certainly not happy with today's young people and the continue degeneration of modern society lol. Sorry to tell you, honey, but there being millions of 'woke' social justice goombas walking around is nothing to be proud of.
@Martin Martins hmmm...I guess you did not see the millions of people peacefully protesting globally made up of every kind of race and background imaginable standing up for justice and equality for ALL. They were mostly young people you know. Get to know God. The truth will set you free honey. Hate is a terrible thing that poisons the soul and ends up going nowhere but down.
@Chris Farley No, everyone should see skin color, but be wise enough to look at the person within. God said so because we are all made in his image. Again, the racist will simply gradually disappear - instinct - as our younger generation takes over who in fact are much wiser than the older generation.
@lovely people lmao that paragraph could not be further from the truth.
@Chris Farley People are here to stay. Get used to it or get left behind. This is the United States of American One Nation Under God with Liberty and Justice for All. The People are with Biden and Harris, and so is God where He does not discriminate. This was a character election. Now there is a black and asian Vice President who happens to be a woman, where this party received the most votes in US history. They are for all states, blue and red where people will love, live and work together towards prosperity and success - the way God intended from the beginning of time. Younger generation is much wiser than the older generation and don't be surprised when one day there will only be brown people in this world. The racisit will simply gradually disappear - instinct.
@UCjDIYMOtRr75g2huV1RWSIw Good then maybe you can stop whining and crying and using skin color for your short comings.
THEN MOVE, STOP COMPLAINING AND JUST LEAVE DO US ALL A FAVOR. üöÄüõ∂üõµ

We‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace, and the norms and notions of what ‚Äújust‚Äù is isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried. That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare. It‚Äôs because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour. But within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So, while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, become the future. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain. If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the West. We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover. And every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid. The new dawn balloons as we free it. For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
WOW. THE BRIGHTEST POEM I HAVE EVER HEARD. Wow, you are amazing. Stay blessed darling.
ùóßùóµùó≤ ùó®ùóªùó∂ùòÅùó≤ùó± ùó¶ùòÅùóÆùòÅùó≤(ùòÄ) ùóºùó≥ ùóõùòÇùó∫ùóÆùóªùó∂ùòÅùòÜ America is in a state of deep scrutiny. So is humanity. Today‚Äôs America presents the future state of humanity: If the world advances the way America is advancing, we will end up being divided between two blocs that hate each other in every sense‚Äîideologically, approach to life, culture, education, and every other way. It will be impossible to connect the adversaries, just as it is impossible to connect the Democrats with the Republicans in today‚Äôs divided United States. As things are, there will be no calm. It seems as though things have gone out of control, but they haven‚Äôt. It is simply what happens when the ego wants to govern and will not hear of anything less than that. It does not want connection; it wants domination. It may be horrifying to watch, but we are merely witnessing the natural process. When everything revolves around who has more and who has less, and when the ego keeps intensifying, we come to a state where the ego wants everything, and to leave absolutely nothing to the other side. This is what you get when you don‚Äôt educate people. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much you invest in aid packages and relief programs, when the ego comes to a state of all or nothing, nothing helps. Therefore, we should thank America for the example it is giving us, at its own expense. We should thank the American people for setting an example that demonstrates what our future will be like unless we achieve unity among us. In other words, if we don‚Äôt achieve a united state in humanity, humanity will become like today‚Äôs United States: an assortment of nations, colors, races, and faiths that hate each other to death, and do everything they can to cater to their hatred
Okay....
Wow!
how beautiful
USA "a country bruised butthole" üëå üá∫üá∏ üòÖüòÇ
‚ÄúWe know to Put our future first, but first we must put our differences aside.‚Äù
Yeah I got a difference for you right here. All i do is win and all you do is lose.
@Nepthu As a European I don't care which party rules the USA. Sure, I have - like every human being - my preferences, but I cannot judge which President or which party does better for most of the people. ( I say "most" because there will never be a party or a politician which makes the whole country happy.) So my call was not for or against a certain party. We just see over here what happens over there in your country... and I am really scared when I read all the hatred comments at each other here. Everyone blames everyone and it begins - or ends - with tirades of hate against each other here or other social media channels. So my call - or plead - was ( including myself) to "see" and listen, overall RESPECT other people - independent of their opinion, believe and so on. If each of us can not put aside hate and disrespect and have no will to be more tolerant .... how can we expect it from other people, from politicians, from countries to keep peace....
@dalangie I agree with you, but my fear is how Democrats treat opposition. Anyone who voted Trump is demonized. Their version of peace means silence to assimilation into their collective hive mind. Will their calls for peace include compromise on their end? No one ever asks this.
@john Muscles Differences will never be put aside as long as peace is not even possible between two persons and people hate each other because of different opinions. Let's start right in our own heart how we see and treat other people. Lots of love from some foreigner in Europe
Wow the irony, great speech though just too bad you said it durring the wrong inauguration.
She's very good at spewing mainstream media propaganda.. I'll give her that.
She's only up there because she's Black
@Travis Green she represents the ghetto and she hates white people so why Biden would get a racist little black girl up there is beyond me
And
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast‚Äù I felt that!!! The only way is up for there!
That's been said many, many times. Sadly, it offers no hope though.
I missed those workhouses....
@S rightüëçüèºsure is
Nope. The beast is on his way. You'll see.
What
"Dr. Biden" lmao. She has a doctorate in education, not medicine. Hahahaha that title is just for showü§£
Did your education ever get you there?
It's still Doctor You idiot that's the title
Omg. They banned dislikes on all of Biden inauguration videos. America is going crazy

Such a beautiful poem.
She is going places.
1 John 5:14: God always hears ‚ÄúThis is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.‚Äù The apostle John, one of the disciples who was closest to Jesus, shares this advice with the early church. It speaks of us having confidence when we pray that God hears us. It also brings in the principle of being close enough to God to know his will so we will be able to know when we ask for things whether they line up with God‚Äôs purposes for our lives and his kingdom.
Miss Gorman had a speech impediment as a younger child and took to writing her words on paper to express herself. Later, she realized her words needed to to be brought to life and gathered the courage to speak her words, learning to overcome her speech impediment, and that is what brought her to where she stood yesterday. A brave and so eloquent young woman who is planning to run for president in 2036. Even if she doesn't reach that lofty goal, I admire her for having a plan and working towards it. She is beautiful. She is America.
@Zolar Czakl only if the players aren‚Äôt kneeling, jk. Enjoy
@Robert Glad you liked it. I'm out. Enjoy your evening. Super Bowl coming up. No politics, just enjoy it if you watch it.
@Zolar Czakl good one
@Robert You're the one throwing shade. Typical Trumper. Your guy lost. Get over it.
@Zolar Czakl typical Democrat
@Robert Stick with Dr. Seuss.
Reaver Red play in traffic your on the WRONG side of YT amanda gorman is amazing
@Be Seeing You so she‚Äôs a Harvard graduate... and all you can say is ‚Äúshe was chosen for her colour‚Äù noted
@Be Seeing You Coming from a guy who voted for the orange-hued guy.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmFTdeT-WAarE9wYtt2hmw/videos
@La Tasha Michelle The people throwing shade at my merely positive post and praise of this fine young lady are (I'm assuming) mostly white males. How would this scenario play out: These same white males wake up one day and find their skin and facial appearances have become black. They still have their white privilege sentiments, but they are suddenly black in appearance. When they get pulled over by a police officer and treated in ways they never have before - perhaps gun drawn on them - and "harassed", how quickly will the words "This isn't fair!" fall from their lips? When they're in a department store and notice they're being watched much more closely and wonder what that's all about, will they again say ,"This isn't fair. I'm just browsing." When they notice that people they actually know but who won't recognize them because their appearance is completely different, and black, and notice that they are being disrespected by them, perhaps having the "N" word thrown at them, will they have the same respect for their friends? If in a few days they wake again white and all the same as before, will they have better appreciation for the struggles black people face solely because of the color of their skin, or will they just go on leaving negative comments just like before? Walk a mile in someone else's shoes. See the world from someone else's eyes and viewpoint.
@Be Seeing You hahahahahaha stay mad fam
@Zolar Czakl I noticed the hate too. Glad there's some love from a few who see the beauty in the speech and the message.
I would wholly support her in 2036. She has much to learn, but I have 0 doubt an eloquent woman as herself would in
@Be Seeing You These morons eat this garbage right up! She could have been up there shi**ing on the microphone and these losers would still be pushing this- HuRRRruuRr DuURrrRrr! sHEs sO sO GrEAT! iM cRyiNg OmG! ANd ShEs A pOc! UrRrRR..
@Paris DONOHOE if George Floyd and BLM hadn't happened in 2020 she wouldn't be standing there - FACT!!!!!
@La Tasha Michelle I always try to be honest. And I had trouble understanding her. Her delivery was poor, and the words were banal. I mean she's good for her age certainly, but I would have preferred a more accomplished poet to present a more meaningful message in a more sophisticated manner. True power does not come from using big words, and fancy gesticulations. It comes from the power to impact people in a meaningful way. I think she impacted people in a superficial way.
@Robert I always look at the positive. #1 The wording was excellent and pronunciation was exquisite. #2 The message was profound. #3 It was positive. #4 She was poised with power.
@Be Seeing You nope but I did get stimulated üòú
@Big L another sheep..... had your covid vaccine yet?
@Be Seeing You who cares at least she had the opportunity and now I know of her , nobody knows you !!!
This is a result of George Ffloyd and BLM. Nothing more nothing less. What was the selection process? We will never know
Like the world needs anymore poets
@Menche Mendoza You can ask, but there is none. üòÅ
@La Tasha Michelle Didn't really find the poem moving to be honest. She used banal phrases like "belly of the beast" and just because it just is doesn't mean there isn't "justice". I mean I definitely couldn't do what she did at her age, but let's not pretend her poem was great, because it wasn't
Amanda, such an elegant powerhouse whose words move mountains. Thank you for carrying the torch so eloquently!
@Kaylah R black or white both have equal opportunities in this day and age. It's poisonous groups like BLM that create racial tension that wasn't there in the first place. George Floyd was he perfect example. Far more Caucasian people died/ die in police custody. It's people like you pandering to them that give them more of a platform. I'm sick to the back teeth of hearing about it
@Be Seeing You Are you saying black people is more prevlieged than white people? Or should The FBI be searvhing for you who was at the capital storming congress?
@Zolar Czakl we must never be afraid to speak our true and honest voice, even if it is at the expense of criticism from others. That said, her wish to run for president at the age of 22 is great. But that shouldn't somehow be a platform for her message. She has zero credentials. Literally. She's a poet for crying out loud. And I stand by my assessment of her poem. It sounds grand, but in reality it is lacking in substance. It is suspect to me also that they decided to choose an attractive young black female to give this opportunity ( a group that is seemingly infallible and immune to criticism). Hispanics and Asians deserve representation too. But of course that doesn't fit the democrat's narrative. It's all about black this black that. It's a bit too much imo.
@Menche Mendoza- The message is centered around the racial/cultural/political divide we have in this country. Basically, the poem expresses her feelings on where we are, and what we could become if we work together towards that goal.
@Be Seeing You- I'd rather have someone that can't tie his shoelaces than someone who can't tell the truth.
Original poster here: I put up a positive comment about the accomplishments of this young lady. Never put any negative vibes out there concerning political figures. Merely mentioned the fact that she plans to run for president. Her idea, not mine. Very many of the reply posts are filled with hate for some reason. Just a suggestion: Smile at a stranger. That person may smile back. You may feel better. Have a nice day, everybody.
@Robert Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Who does she think she is running for president? It‚Äôs kinda unrealistic.
@Be Seeing You You‚Äôre deluded, it‚Äôs crazy how you think you aren‚Äôt the only one who looks ignorant here.
@Be Seeing You all these Biden haters love trump usually so that‚Äôs pretty interesting. It‚Äôs called biased buddy. You don‚Äôt know any thing about Biden besides what you want to listen tooüòÇ
@Reaver Red You‚Äôre aware there were only 30 set jobs on that pipe right and it was actually taking more jobs away by being built üòÇ right?
@Be Seeing You that‚Äôs rude and you‚Äôre an example of the problem
@patricia x are you that sad that you need to scrutinise someone's grammar? Have you never been a victim of autocorrect on your phone? Or have you just always been a victim of life ü§£
@Be Seeing You just an fyi "" And of story" is END of story. Learn more, educate yourself....and you may not be so contrary to overly simplistic thinking. Nobody picked her just for skin color. I'm white btw.
@Menche Mendoza Did I ever mention importance? You interpret the words for how it makes you feel. That's poetry.
@TB Wms ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ biden can't tie his own shoelaces and he's now running the country ü§£
@Be Seeing You- Biden is not racist. You are taking whatever he may have said in the past out of context. Biden has said that he was raised to believe that he was no better than anyone else. All white people were not raised that way. And more importantly, I believe Biden is authentic. I truly believe he wants to tackle the problems we currently have in this country, and try to make life better for everyone. I really hope he succeeds.
@Be Seeing You you don't think they would choose a pasty new englander with red hair, who has a lisp?
@Reaver Red she was used for such a time like this where death is lurking all around spiritually and natural and because she had a message of hope for those that are stuck on yesterdays hate. And she was used because she's wise and intelligent for her age and for her message üíãüíãüíãüíãüíã
@TB Wms ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ biden is the most racist president you lot have ever had. Have you not read some of his historical quotes surrounding the black community? Or are you gonna put that down to his obvious case of early onset dementia
@Be Seeing You- I'm sure he wanted the participants to be diverse. If you don't know her accomplishments, you need to do some research. Please don't allow jealousy or hatred to cloud your thinking.
@Be Seeing You you meant end of story?
@TB Wms black privelidge is what it was - fact! Thousands of Harvard grads out there. Would be interesting to know the selection process
@Be Seeing You She was picked as a stunning gem, What beauty, inside and out, Stunning. Stopped me in my tracks, what a graceful beauty, truly unique.
@Be Seeing You- Maybe so, but the girl is a Harvard graduate and extremely talented! No one else could have done a better job.
She was picked for her skin colour. And of story !
You are not accepted by the other's American sis let's move to Africa
Charming personality.
Beautiful and very inspirational
She nailed this
Go fix africa hypocrite
@N0gam oh it is? words can be hurtful, but never raciest..dope
@Pedro Dynamite that's like saying words can't be hurtful
@N0gam words cant be raciest..
Careful, racism is showing
@„Çπ„Ç´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà Sighting a poem saying her people would make America better.. is Africa better?
@Pedro Dynamite she‚Äôs a poet activist, not a politician.
@„Çπ„Ç´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà well what can she do for America?
@Pedro Dynamite did she say she was born in Africa? Even if that were the case what could she do to fix a whole country.
@„Çπ„Ç´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà I mean if she is African before American.
What are you on about?
Perhaps you should go fix Mexico --Pedro. ;)
Not impressed...in fact I noticed several contradictions
Only those that seek the truth can hear it
https://youtu.be/-OF3YpX8kgI
The great irony of this moment is that if Joe Biden were working for Starbucks, what he used to say about race would get him fired. But now he‚Äôs useful because he is dependent on blacks.
Incredible! Well delivered! Loved it
Brilliant! Sounds like a young Maya Angelou!
I need to take a few pages from her book....or maybe the whole damn thing. I‚Äôm awe struck. She has a beautiful and powerful voice too. Wise beyond her age.
Thank you! We still have hope listening to you!
Powerful, beautiful, talented words and young lady. üíûüíñüíãüíÉüèæ
Stunning poem!
She has the same movement of words as Martin Luther King
Bunch of b's! Lies
Amazing
She delivered it with full confidence! I love it üòç
Here are her words: When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade?

Beautiful Poem!
Mr. Miranda, eat your heart out!
Can anyone here please explain the the meaning of " We braved the belly of the beast" .
Trump, we made it through the worst of it, and now can only get out As a lion, we lived through the belly, now we're uh, going out.
A new era of empowered poets has dawned.
This speech makes me mad, now I have to study it in English class, and my smooth ass brain can‚Äôt comprehend the level of iq.
OMG! I am tears listening to your burning in passionate poem. Bravo l

A wonderful poem by a beautiful young woman with a beautiful heart.
Everyone: Wow, that poem was amazing and inspirational! My family: There's a Hamilton reference! There's another one! THERES HAMILTON REFERENCES IN THIS
@Reaver Red No, I should've clarified. We love the references! :D
@jerrell3451 No... I love it personally XD
And it didn't help that we'd listened to the soundtrack right before watching the inauguration... XD
SAME

This is not a literary movement, but only rigor mortis..
Would have Never seen her at Trumps inauguration
Obviously?n
The final stanza brought tears to my eyes. So much hope, so much conviction in being our best version of America.
If you gave This BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BLACK WOMAN A thumbs down...It's something SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOUR MENTAL!..AND YOUR PREJUDICE IS DEFINITELY SHOWING!....
You literally voted for a racist.
Repurify recover .. let it begin ‚ù§Ô∏è
Biden is the president of the corporation(NULL AND VOID). THE USA BECAME A REPUBLIC ON 4TH JULY 2020. THE BEST IS YET TO COME...
The only part of the inauguration worths watching.
She maybe talks typical stupid bs speech but have to admit this woman looks amazing, her outfit, face, hairstyle, color combination.
Lovely  Inspiring young lady, absolutely wonderful poem just what the country needs to hear.
blahhhhhhhhhh
WHAT A BRAVE INTELLIGENT WOMAN
cool identity politics pandering to the na√Øve telling them they are victims... obama 2.0 she sure would make a great politician alrite.... lots of empty words with a crooked smile attempting to talk ever so eloquently off a piece of paper...
lol
she just made my list of inspiring people, she is the future of the untied states.
She brought tears to these old and cynical eyes, wonderful. She almost made me want to be American again.
@Reaver Red I am calm. I‚Äôm asking a relevant question. If he didn‚Äôt enjoy it why is he under this video better yet this comment? The main comment is so positive, why not take your negativity somewhere else?
@orionh3000 so why are you here? Go cry somewhere else.üíñ
Amanda Gorman, what a bright and beautiful angel you are, guiding us with your bright light through these times of darkness. May our Lord always guide you and help you achieve your goals.
Wow, - where do ya start. Incredible words and delivery. Kudos to Amanda - what a bright future awaits her
I'm surprised bidden didint touch her or smell her hair or whisper creepy things in here ear
This poem was the Best part of the entire inauguration. I think that this young woman Amanda, and her Epic poem , should be placed in our history books, this poem she reads is History made today 1/20/21. God Bless America üá∫üá∏ Amen,  God Bless Us ALL, Amen üíó
Someone put me out of my misery !!!!!! Just shoot me now!!!!!!!Will this "poem" ever end ??????
The utopian ellipse phytochemically discover because capricorn temporarily scold despite a truculent pamphlet. hanging, dispensable yugoslavian
Ew
The delirious cappelletti puzzlingly release because dogsled mechanically unpack on a receptive author. foregoing, obnoxious radiator
Thats the biggest childrens head band ive ever seen. Does it make her feel good to use big words that dont fit into context? Blah blah blah. 15 words could have said this much mouth context. Get to the point .... gah leeee.
I feel sorry for her. Clearly no one ever filled her in about Joe‚Äôs past stances and remarks regarding black people.
@Kevin Johnson the Muslim ban has been cancelled thankfully to Biden.
@Kevin Johnson there was a whole fiasco happening the first yearTrump was president when he tried building a wall that in return separated families from their children.
@Kevin Johnson they both have spoken openly what they feel. Out of your heart you speak stuff Verbally. So if you are saying one person (Trump ) is non racist would be a lie.
@Kevin Johnson couple quotes from Trump you probably dismissed: ‚ÄúI have black guys counting my money. ‚Ä¶ I hate it,‚Äù
@Kezia Kandii "letting blacks integrate would create a racial JUNGLE"..... And now... Tell me exactly what Trump said that is racist? Please tell me
Same with Trump....the pancake is burnt both sides.
It's all downhill from here.
Wow. Just Wow!!!! Such Brilliance!! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè. Brava young lady, molto bravo!!!
WOW!!!! What could you even say to the power of that!!!
Absolutely beautiful.
WOW!! 22 years with more wisdom and voice than I've seen in those with 3x her years. Gives me HOPE for our country. Grateful for that moment yesterday and that it was a message hear round the World.
NBC is the worst!! I can't watch the freaking news without knowing what party the people are in!!
Empty hype.. these words barely mean nothing. Platitudes. Anyone seeing more in this is trying too hard
Cringe
Super cringe at the fact its a racist she is supporting
how? you're suppose to hear the speech, no one forced to look at it
I hope the 25,000 troops that were protecting Joe Xiden from Americans appreciated the poem.
I'm watching from Singapore. I'm so lifted from this beautiful, beautiful poem. Thank you for the experience.
Wonder why anyone would give a thumbs down ü§î beautifully delivered and so needed after the hate, lies, divisiveness from 45. Life seems so much quieter without the constant tweets and lies. What will happen to my late night comedy, Where I go to for some small slice of humor , during delusional 45 tenure.

A fraudulent president with a paid crowd disgusting we went back Donald Trump!!!
imagine creating a dumb narrative to make yourself think you're right

As a non American, I admit this was very beautiful and inspiring. God bless your country. If there are any poetry lovers out there, I do interpreations on my channel, check them out if you'd like :)
To be so young and yet so poised and eloquent in front of such an audience. Wow. She‚Äôs an extraordinary young woman.
Lauryn Hill vibes
Wow another black face how surprising!!!
We lost the light today. Communism is evil.
"If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it." Amanda, you are a leader and I pray that you inspire future generations to be leaders just like you.
THINK ON THE WORDS. "When day comes, we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it The day comes --- Day is Light and to have shade there must be light ------ Right? Meaning of Shade: 1. comparative darkness and coolness caused by shelter from direct sunlight: "sitting in the shade" synonyms shadow, shadiness, shadows, coolness, cool, ... light, glare 2. a color, especially with regard to how light or dark it is or as distinguished from one nearly like it: QUESTION: WHAT IF SHE USED IT AS THE SLANG TERMINOLOGY? SHADE (SLANG) Shade is a popular slang term that means disrespect. The term commonly appears as "throwing shade", which is similar to saying "disrespecting" or "dissing." The term is used to describe when a person disrespects another person, which is also known as "talking trash" about a person. The Disrespect comes from the Laws created by Biden and Others before HIM -- including Trump. The Disrespect comes at the Vary Skin color she has -- to enrich All others Above you. So far Biden has done so much for Everyone Eles EXCEPT the Black people that Actually Voted to get him in office. Oh yeah -- he increased SNAP --- NOPE --- more classified White people are on the Food Stamp program than blacks. More blacks are Essential workers. Biden and Harris (is the granddaughter of a white man - a plantation owner and a black female. Her mother was from the White Class in India that hated the darker skin lower class of people.) have a Large hatred for the Black communities -- Listen to their speeches and to their Actions. Biden always screams he wants to help the black communities with 1. low-Income Housing 2. more social benefits 3. more project housing 4. more private prison system programs. NOTHING ABOUT --- SELF EMPLOYMENT 2. HOME OWNERSHIP 3. IMPROVE SCHOOL SYSTEM 4. REMOVE THE CRIME BILL, WAR ON DRUGS, AND 3-STRICK LAW 5. PUNISH BANKS/LENDERS FOR REDLINING AND HIGH-INTEREST RATES ON BLACK PEOPLE 6. REMOVE THE UNJUST JUDGES, LAWYERS, AND POLICE WITH CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST THEM. 7. REBUILD AND REPAY THE BLACK OWNERS OF ALL THE BUSINESSES STOLEN UNDER WAR ON DRUGS AND WHITE SUPREMACY SUCH AS BLACK WALLSTREET AND OTHERS. FOR A START. WHERE IN AMERICA HAS THIS BEEN FOR THE BLACK PEOPLE? WHAT NEW DAWN --- WITH THE CRIME BILL AND OTHER LAWS STILL IN FULL FORCE AGAINST THE BLACK COMMUNITIES THEY TARGETED FOR THE PURPOSE OF WHITE WEALTH AND GAINS. WHAT PEOPLE ARE BEING DISRESPECTED? WHAT NATION OF 4-FATHERS 1ST REALIZED A REVOLUTION? --- THAT WAS NOT FOR BLACK PEOPLE THAT IS FOR SURE -- DURING THAT TIME THESE SAME 4-FATHERS WERE CREATING LAWS TO MAINTAIN BLACK PEOPLE AS ANIMAL.
Wow she amazing! "If only were brave enough to see it, if only were brave enough to be it" ü§îüí™üèæ
She might actually just become president one day.
Pseudo-intellectual, pretentious, melodramatic, meaningless drivel
it's a shame that this speech was used to celebrate the election of such a phoney and fraudulent election as that of the super phoney Joe Biden
This woman is the young lady MLK
Actually, that would be Tamika Mallory.
God bless America! God bless the World!
Okay, great but did she have to mention Lebron? I mean his ego is big enough as it is.
Amazing: Beautiful, insightful, and powerful :) Really truly inspiring
All you thumbs down people are truly deplorable.
Her words and presence are so beautiful and so graceful. She‚Äôs like a beacon of hope for the future.
She oughta be a rapper....
It's the accent and intelligence for me.
In other words for you it was the outfit and the social media exposure not the message ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Jack Frisxo exactly my question man
I don't think he/she would reply lol
üòê
Phenomenal it was like Maye Angelo was speaking straight through her!
Ladies and gentlemen, you‚Äôre next and future president of these United States.
I am beyond captivated by her...she is truly destined for greatness.
My eyes weep from the strength and truth she portrays
"Quiet isn't always peace."
@Ina-Louise Benzo yes, I noticed that too. It's too deep for some, so I just let it go. Some people aren't able to get outside of themselves. It's sad.
@Jane EM oh no I wasn‚Äôt talking about you. I was talking about the people in the comments referring to their experiences with Quiet being peace in way that sort of contradicts what you said.
@Ina-Louise Benzo I get it. That's why I wrote it down. Heh?
So you guys completely missed her point. Got it. Quiet is most often associated with peace...that‚Äôs why she said it isn‚Äôt always that.
@Hahn k F ,Quiet isn't "always" peace. Sometimes it is.
‚Äã@Hahn k F,¬†talking about external quiet or internal?
Quiet can often be the most dangerous sometimes and sometimes speak up can bring peace . security can sometimes be insecurity. read to learn not just to understand
@Reaver Red the ‚Äú11,000‚Äù jobs you think were lost we‚Äôre just contractors who aren‚Äôt out of work forever, they lost one job that would have lasted about 2 weeks
Nothing exemplified that more than the media silence during Obama's presidency, the same silence you're going to get now.
Quiet is always Peace tho that‚Äôs the definition of peace if anything speaking out would make things temporarily less peaceful
im sorry sweety but i myself am afraid what my anger does so i just stay quiet so i dont land in jail because of some jerks
Yes, when things get a little too quiet, you should be attuned to trouble. I myself search for a little peace and quiet. Where peace and quiet are one and the same thing.
Let not "Our Blender becomes their Burden"
"Our blunders become their burdens."
Trump runs for congress in Florida 2022 then President 2024 dem worst nightmare
@Betty Boop It was a private company. Anyways all hail ingsoc!
@Betty Boop and social media isn't a right, it's a privilege, he doesn't need twitter or anything like that, so yes I am celebrating censorship because it was right.
@Betty Boop yes... I'm the fascist pig. üò≥
@N0gam Fascist pig I guess you celebrate censorship
How will anyone even know about him? He's banned from almost all social medias üòå

DISGUSTING
5.4k people dislike this video? 5.4k people are too ignorant to understand it.
Blah blah blah he‚Äôs not a legitimate president ok, Donald Trump was the one who won the election wake up...
Prove it
Garbage.... DEMONcrats are coming for your rights protected by our Constitution..... WWG1WGA
I love her üíöüíõ‚ù§Ô∏è üôèüèΩ üá™üá∑
Thank you Amanda and no I am not an American but you don't need to be to understand what she is saying this is the most powerful poem.i have ever heard
maya angelo passed that torch bring it home baby girl bring it home
Finally Democracy is üîô! üá∫üá∏ Biden üá∫üá∏ üôÇ‚úåÔ∏è
She quoted the Bible and George Washington. I‚Äôm crying
I'm not bahahahaha
@davedaddy101 Get over yourself.
George Washington and Jesus would both hate Joe Biden. He is a false king who stole an election.
OMG.. get a grip. Do you need a tissue. PUKE.
So ready for this new chapter of presidency
"Poor kids are just as smart as white kids"
The haters had to come and dislike this. Thank God, no hate can stop the brilliance of this
Such a beautiful brave poem! May God continue to bless and use you Amanda as you continue to pave the way for future generations!!!
The highlight of a special day in our countries history. Amanda‚Äôs powerful words sum up beautifully where we‚Äôve been as a country and where we are headed.
This is the daughter of my grade 6 english teacher lol
omg that's so cool
@how to properly clean your plastic computer he can't be your dad Because I'm your dadüòÇ
Yeah and Joe Biden is my dad
Angelina Vargas Its yours
@Hahn k F What about it?
My ass
isn‚Äôt that great? im so proud
Repukes only get riled up with racist insults and WWF carnival barker funny voices as they gobble up a bunch of fake hollow promises. They can't handle anything like this..
She spoke with a tremendous amount of power and conviction in her voice. She wanted to send this message to as many people as she could and I can say with confidence - we heard it. Simply beautiful and makes me proud to be American in such a trying time
Just as I did with Obama, I hope Biden fails! #MAGA
Thank you, Amanda, brilliant!
For a moment America stood still
ÎÑò Î¨¥ÏÑúÏõåÏöî
Most definitely todays Maya Angelou. Her ring on her right hand is from Oprah. It is a symbol of Maya Angelous book,"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" FYI
I agree with the sentiment, but isnt this kinda overrated? Words like "the light," came across as vague. Especially when you consider this is Biden we talking about, not the most progressive person on the map. I agree with the paris agreement tho...
The young Maya Angelo. Shine on girlüíñüëç

Contrast the intelligence, beauty and eloquence of this amazing young lady with the ignorance, ugliness and stupidity of the mob that descended on the capitol on January 6. What a difference 2 weeks makes.
Beauty?
Nah, I'll take the mob. At least they were exciting.
wunderdoggy that is no where near breaching the capitol. It hasn't been breached since the 1800s
@destined2win right, you seem like a pretty nice, if somewhat self-righteous person. Frankly, I don't care for your beliefs, and you're definitely severely misinformed on many fronts, but it's your country, not mine. Do what you will with it.
@Jade Lin Lee Chen look man I dont agree with what your saying at all. But I would die for your right to say it
@Jade Lin Lee Chen bruh you act like they killed people or burned the capitol down ‚ò† it was because of the obviously fraudulent election. And ye I misspoke about the Zuckerberg I meant jack Dorsey. But it dont matter cuz Zuckerberg banned Bible verses on Facebook too.
@destined2win The attack on the capitol was an act aimed at oppressing democracy, and oppressing voters. Also, Zuckerberg didn't ban Trump from Twitter lmao
@Jade Lin Lee Chen how do trump supporters oppress others when they are the side of free speech. Mark Zuckerberg is a known Democrat who banned trump from Twitter, banned Bible verses, banned conservatives, banned any reference to being Christian. How is that not oppression
@Jade Lin Lee Chen antifa destroyed things and killed people because they didn't like other peoples opinions. They were not "fighting for the right to live"
@destined2win what part did you not understand? "Right to live"? Or "oppress others"? Or do they sound the same to you?
@wunderdoggy so a contested election should _always_ be examined... wasn't the 2016 election pretty contested? Yet it wasn't examined, and I wonder why. Oh, wait. It was because Hillary Clinton actually accepted defeat. The 2020 election _has_ been examined. Georgia alone has recounted all ballots _thrice._ Trump has had multiple investigators look into it and raised multiple lawsuits, and _no election fraud_ was found. What more "examination" do you want? Also, the nerve of you to say BLM is being racist against white people. I haven't seen BLM enslaving and lynching white people, but I guess advocating for black people to not be brutalized = advocating for white supremacy, huh?
@Jade Lin Lee Chen so antifa dont club people in the head set fires scream to silence others, blm wasnt race based only advocating black matters(racist) just like the KKK advocating white matters,,,if an election is contested like so so so many in the history of democracy and other political philosophies it should be examined and open to interrogaion by a non-interested third party and not the incumbants
@Jade Lin Lee Chen that doesn't even begin to make sense ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@wunderdoggy blm and antifa protested for their right to live. trump supporters and neo-nazis protested for their right to oppress others.
@Joe Stupid " to compare the underlying goals of protests about injustice that have become violent at their edges to an anti-democratic uprising fueled by lies and conspiracy theories is to ignore history, and the truth." Ali Velshi https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/comparing-blm-marches-capitol-riots-ignores-history-truth-n1254596
Contrast with the profound ignorance of the Democratic Party. What did they do to serve the people over the past four years (without mentioning Trump)
Yes, antifa and blm were horrible. Also the rioters in portland, seattle, minneapolis...remember?
And the mobs that burnt and rioted all summer long ???
@master ninja guessing you‚Äôre a brainwashed trump supporter so that‚Äôs rich
More brainwashed television watchers talking like they know something.
Jan 6th?
Very powerful words.... exceptionally talented sister...had me in tears üò≠ ‚ù§Ô∏è
Brainwash
Man her skin is shiny wtf how much water she drinking
all of it
Her words carry no meaning when one side wants to silence the other.
Had to come back today to hear this again. Will probably be back tomrorow. And the next day. And the next day. And...
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
What a brilliant young woman. Thank you Amanda for such moving words. God continue to bless you , please continue this path.
Amazing ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
Simply the best
This is probably the best thing I have ever heard ‚ù§Ô∏è
this is *chefs kiss*
Just Beautiful!!!!!!!!
Gotta throw that Single Mother in there!?
The Black girl made magic ‚ú®
Damn, this young lady was good, the words, the articulation, the hand gestures, facial expressions...............she was into it and made me get into it. I had to come here and listen to it again. Excellent presentation of a poem by a gifted young lady.
Perversion of words
You know what it becomes a black thing I get tired of hearing everyone jumped on the bandwagon this is just ridiculous
She just did THAT!!üíôüíôüíô and she did it with truth, eloquence and grace!
She makes as much sense as Biden.
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. Galatians 6:7-8¬†NKJV (https://www.crossway.org/articles/what-is-the-gospel-2/) (https://bible.org/article/gods-plan-salvation)
I love this lady so much
Unnecessary pretentious drivel but she's black so I guess that makes her and her poem special.
You could do better?
@Ikenna Smash Thanks, mmm smell that air!
Affirmative action at its finest. Also, congrats on winning *the* lottery.
Row Row Row your boat The democrats stole the vote They think that they won That ant so son When you cheat you can't gloat The democrats have stopped the microscope From looking at the votes they hope In a few months or a year We will discover what you fear Your treason will earn you a rope
Puppet
This poem is trash. Bring back Maya Angelou.
Boring! When does the military drag Biden out of the Oval Office by his hair?
Quite possibly the most beautiful words I have ever witnessed being spoken. I hope these words will be remembered, taught, and spoken long after we all have died.
I hope she keeps soaring x! Absolute treasure ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I think we will hear from this young lady a lot more!! Young people like her are giving hope. She represents the future, a future how it should be...wish her good luck and success!!!
Fantastic. Just fantastic.
Brilliant. Brave. Bold. Beautiful. Black! An American!
That young woman hit it out of the park!!!!
Did she study at Moscow High?
We would do well to engrave these beautiful words into the entrance of the Congress chambers
Yup
Awesome young lady! This is the best of America!üíÉüèΩüíêüçæüá∫üá∏
Just beautiful and well done
As I listened to Amanda Gorman poem it stuck in my spirit about being a light and this is my humble response: I am the light because the Holy Spirit lives inside. She woke up the poet that lies dormant but it never dies. Jesus said that we are that light a city on a hill. But we can only be that light if we do the master's will. We shine in all weather and even rain. We shine through our happiness and our pain. You remember that God spoke and said let there be light and it was not comprehended by the darkness of night. He hung sun, moon, and stars to guide us along the way. Who have you led today? Have you said a kind word or given someone hope? What words of encouragement have you spoke? Do you realize that you can't see a shadow without light. Help us Jesus retore our sight. The world is pleading for us to turn up our wattage. If you understand the urgency then my friend you've got it. You understand that Jesus is the only way to the promise land. He died so that we could live. He sent his spirit to reside so we could give. Give a helping hand to those who are in need. Be a bandage to those who bleed. People are hurting and stumbling in the dark. Give them light even if it's just a spark. A spark can start a flame! Shine, shine, shine on in Jesus name. Because like the great poet said "It's not enough to see the light if you don't become the light"! Machel Parks 1/21/2021
Wakanda forever
Nah. Study Chaucer and Shakespeare. B intelligent, not Stalinist brainwashed.
Thank You Ms Gorman!
Speaking to the people of deception
"There's always light if we're brave enough to see it." Damnnn
Amanda, that is beautiful. And others, read her poem "In this Place (an American Lyric)," which is so moving I cannot read out loud as it makes me verklempt.
She shined brighter than the sun. I love hearing her speak.
Color therapy and marketing works. It's been proven. I LOVE yellow!
@S955US84 Youre just not happy for succeeding people :)
you are easily impressed
These words will forever be etched in my mind. I have seen her speech so many times and it touches me each and every time!! She was powerful and on point and remarkable!
Her speech gave me goosebumps! It was amazing!
great job to amanda, an inspiration to all--even my 83 year old grandmother--!
Jesus is Lord ‚ô°
Thanks I missed this part!!! You may like our song Ways Out by foxzen https://youtu.be/Bk_7HRq49R8
God I'm in tears. Can you imagine 45 ever authorising this?
sometimes, if you listen very carefully, you can hear the lyrical genius of this woman.
The Holy Word of God - The Bible: John 3 : 16 - 21 _"16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."_
"light in this never ending shade" . Shade is something positive, so not sure if this really works. darkness or night would have been better instead..?
Just more leftist propoganda to divide and conquer. "White man bad." Racism towards white people is STILL racism!
haha that sucked
"The Hill We Climb" When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn‚Äôt always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time Then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade But in all the bridges we‚Äôve made That is the promise to glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it
The lyrics guy
@Jerry I read it over and over again it's a shame if you didn't
The way she rhymes is absolutely incredible!
Thank for sharing. Amazing. She is visionary, I think!
*Quietly singing songs from Hamilton in the corner *
Thank you!! ‚ù§
@Jerry I read the whole poem...beautiful!
Bro? No one is reading that
A very bright, extremely talented and amazing young lady....beautiful inside and out. I am so proud of her!!
Thanks üòä
Thank you for sharing
You have inspired me to go back into writing again thank you Amanda I Am Going to purchase your book to support you I hope and pray that one day you will be the next President!! LOVE üíò YOU.
üíú
Thank you for that.
We will rise! Amazing poem, I love hearing intelligence again on a consistent basis.
People have forgotten that Biden was for school segregation back in the 1970's. Wealthy rich white Male didn't want his kids going to school with black kids. Biden also passed the 1990' crime bill that resulted in mass incarceration of petty crimes that destroyed the black communities. The same guy that called well known KKK clan members friends.... How quickly America has forgotten. But hey you ain't Black unless you voted for Biden. What a hypocrite
@Jewel M. That would be no different than supporting those criminals all during 2020 vandalizing property, businesses, and rioting.. I support protesting but not destroying our cities.
@Jewel M. He had 40 plus years in government to do good and make a change. I can not show support to someone that I do not agree with. Pray for him sure.... Support him. Sorry that goes against what I stand for. Not throwing any stones. I just clearly stated Facts about Biden throughout his career as a politician.
He ain't Trump tho bruh..... support him in whatever good he can do. "He who is without sin, let him cast the first stone."
All the trumpists are insulting her and saying this speech is stupid and boring because 1. There to stupid to understand it 2. She isn't speaking at Trump's inauguration that was never gonna happen 3. They are used to hearing "MEXICANS BAD!", "FRAUD ELECTION!!!", and "EVERYONE IS LYING BUT ME!!!!!"
Gibberish.
lol
what "just is" isn't always justice
Don't you love her color scheme where have I seen those colors before bunch of f****** idiot
Didn‚Äôt hear the poem but I hate this way of speaking. I guess it‚Äôs a poetic way of reciting? I would rather have it spoken in a cold way than the breathless sounding way it is performed
Sure...
Thank you.
For sur gaga and lopez look so dull compare to this brillant mind
I never cried about things like this. But that day was the day. Thats what i needed. Thank you.
Wow, great poetry and an effective speech, all in one! I would like to see more poetical speeches.
"where can we find light in this never ending shade",..love this entire poem and this beautiful young woman who wrote and delivered it to the World

The more I listen to this, the I am in awe. I'm in awe that someone so young can be so wide eyed and and insightful to capture the world this completely. I have a pair of shoes older than her. Yet, with all my added experience, I sleepwalk through life, unaware of how to express anything even close to this!
At this time. ( Jan 21st 2021) The likes outnumber the dislikes by a ratio of 9:1. The lunatic 10%. That is what rational America is dealing with. The Crazy/Stupid Are Loud. But they are massively outnumbered. Never forget this day and these words. Make America Safe Again.
I thought this was filled with clich√©s not terribly impressed at all
Jan 20, 2021 no doubt is the saddest day in American history - DC looks like Tiananmen Square in 1989, a POTUS needs 50K army around him to stay in power.
Because of unlawful insurrection based off of proven lies caused DC to lockdown. Please listen to this gem to educate yourself or at least have a little soul. üôèüòÅ I'll pray for you
Brava !
apparently she was born premature and had auditory and speech processing issues,. all i can say is WoW , im speechless , she is the highlight of this event.
@Christian Hardwick jesus christ
@OnThe Right You're an indoctrinated conservative, and that's not good. How does yours or my opinion offer any unity? It just makes us assholes.
@lilmayo not as old as jim crow whininh

MAGA whining is getting old.
I was also born with these issues and still struggle understanding people. But i am white, also descended from slaves, but didnt have the privelege of being a black woman from LA who was priveleged enough to have my single blacl mother somehow afford to put me in a 34k-54k per year k-12 program... I also wrote speeches.
@John Citizen well, if you are stupid enough then Yes you are right LoL
Lmao ü§£
But you're not speechless. You've written a paragraph about it.
@OnThe Right cry abt it he lost move on
@Christian Hardwick dont care much about politics in US ..im just happy coz i have a 460 baby boy, 23weeker and this gives me hope .. that‚Äôs all
That‚Äôs not saying much. Yay Antifa. Bad Patriots! So much for unity.
and God's sun was shining that day !
Why was Bill Clinton there when he is Jeffrey Epstein's best friend?
didn;t speak for all religious groups, and all ethnic backgrounds, not to mention political groups, all in all for EVERY American citizen. so it was a failure of a speech. As an american i can't find myself in her speech. Shame on you!
after she spoke, Trump was already forgotten
What will libs have to complain about now that their world view has been turned upside down hmmmm
And then Trump spoke of forming a new political party and he's front-page news again. Trump is _never_ going away.
That ladies and gentlemen is how to communicate üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
What an artist of words! Simply Beautiful! Bravooooo!
Oh wow, after four years of despairing of America from the other side of the Pond I am now bowled over by such maturity and wisdom from one so young. Faith in the future restored!
Will be great for her CV
It‚Äôs a pain relief after all that hatred speech from that stupid guy wait I forgot his name already. That speech makes me believe again there is a chance for humanity to recover...hope that more nations inhabitants follow her vision.
She is Phenomenal, Phenomenal, Phenomenal.

Lets vote her for president!!üòÉ
Yet another of Americas so many beautiful, articulate young black ladies that make so many around the world proud!! The gates are open now!!
WORDS ARE POWERFUL
Her gesture is beautiful.. thank you.
Not my president GOOD LUCK TRAITORS!
Sounds like rap.
@London Lion Ha! I see what you did there.
Race-baiting America Don't speak racism that's not a black or white person that's an American! Racism can affect anyone! To call racism poetry is sick to Americans! This is how Obama got elected not for his qualifications! BLM hate group keeping racisms alive Biden's Bait for not apologizing live racist remarks towards true Americans! Never support Biden that is supported by communism, China which America looks like right now! Morgan Freeman!
Burisma Joe
Dr Jill... lmao!! The funniest line in this whole thing. The other part which is not funny at all is that we now have one of the most corrupt persons in the White House and calls for unity and healing while calling 75 million Americans bigots because they did not vote for him. He is Joe, and he is Joe Bidens husband!!
It‚Äôs amazing how arrogant professional victims can be. A mediocre talent (at best) lectures us hula style with her hair hat how the next generation is going to fix America - a bigger joke than grandpa dementia‚Äôs presidency
Gorgeous. Just gorgeous. Watching this, my heart feels so full. For the first time in a very, very long time, I feel proud to be an American again. ‚ù§Ô∏è ü§ç üíô
So youre anti WHITE?
Biden is the biggest threat to jobs.. He has already killed thousands of jobs and it is only his second day..
The shining black swan trumps the orange glazed turkey
Black girl magic's finest!üëëüôåüèø
Incredible
i dont see what's the fuss, she is just ordinary, even children these days can read and speak
Except she is not a child and she wrote it the whole thing. If that‚Äôs all you got from it then you weren‚Äôt paying attention
She's going to be one of the greatest poets of this generation, I can feel it!
Just Beautiful Queen! Chill Was All Over Me Listening To Your Real And Spiritual Word's. Thank You Queen And Much Love And Stay Safe. Shalom Brothers And Sisters!!! üëºüòá‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòòüôÜüëçüí™üëäüëäüëäüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üíØüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
When we don't judge others by the complexion of their skin, this is what you can get. She is the "whole" package!
Wtf my mum told me to do this but this good noice
Wonderful poem young lady!!! We have not seen all that God has in store for you. Keep your hands in His and allow Him to guide you. God bless youüôåüèæüëèüèΩüôèüèæüòä
Inspiring! I love her Hamilton references, too.
That sound man was on point!
A very intelligent young lady!
BEAUTIFUL I loved this and we needed to hear this as a nation.
A truly powerful moment.
She dances with words, it is so beautiful.
EXCELLENT!!
This brilliant human being is way beyond her years. Her speech was amazing and she deserves to be a political speaker for the White House or something motivating people in the right direction. She would have my vote haha
Who in the WORLD are the people that hit a "thumbs down" on this magnificent, beautiful, and phenomenally gifted young Black woman?????
Toxic people.
I may or may have not watched 3 separate videos of the same poem recitingüëÄcan you blame me? it was so good!üôà
What a beautiful young Lady, word's of wisdom beyond her age, one day she will be standing right there taking her oath to our country
Impeach Biden
I hate to make the comparison but..... shakespeare, poe, (eminem?), Etc.
Beautiful, Classy, Brilliant, Huge!! Best wishes to this young human being. I wish I could shake her mothers and grandmothers hand. They did this!!
Soo beautiful and truthfully honest!! If she is the future, we are good!!üôè‚ô•Ô∏èüòä
Fantastic poem, Trump has already been forgotten. You stole my heart ... I hope President Biden is doing a lot better than his predecessor. In 2036 I will be 74, I hope to see you as president of a much better world. Signed by Marc a Belgian citizen
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
4.5K give this illustrious poem a thumbs down? Some have a lesson to learn.
How can anyone not see the powerful message from a 22 year old, and the way it was crafted and articulated as anything but simply outstanding? Jealousy and hatred...that's all it is!
@T. Williams jealous of someone younger more intelligent and articulate. Go have a waank and a walk you‚Äôll feel better
50:7 is definitely not something you can ignore
I wouldn't worry about this small minority. I am more hopeful of a full generation of students who will become voters in the near future that will heed her words. That makes me smile.
I find this be very racist!
We have to assume she passed the sniffing test from the"big guy".
Poet Amanda Gorman shines brighter than the Sun her words provokes tears to roll on my face. Biden should hire her to write his speeches. After seeing those violent thugs invading Capitol Hill, Amanda Gorman is a refreshing example of how someone should conduct themselves.
BLAH BLAH BLAH ITS EVERYBODYS COUNTRY NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTYS
If that's all you got out of this poem, then I feel truly sorry for you. Trump was right when he said, he loved the poorly educated, and you're a prime example.
Bravo young woman üëèüëèüëèBRAVOOO
Awareness is known by awareness alone.
Bravo
Very first time in a long time that this made me proud to live in America. This was really good
I hope I‚Äôm alive by the time she runs for President of the United States...
Simply Marvelous.

I'm not American but I feel her OPTIMISM ..WOW!..Everything she said is so Precise!It makes me wanna cry, so proud of her. AMERICA IS BACK! WHO KNOWS SHE MIGHT BE THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE USA.GOD BLESS AMERICA  THE WORLD!#HEAL
P O W E R F U L S T U N N I N G I N S P I R I N G POEM ... Youth Poet Laureate Ms. Amanda Gorman THANK YOU! üíõüíñ‚ú®‚òùüèΩüèπ‚öî
I'll translate. A "victim" talks about about being a "victim" in front of a "victim" supporting party and "victim" indoctrinated population still using slaves hundreds of years later.....Forever a victim.
I wonder if she would be interested in amending our Pledge of Allegiance...
How dare you say that. It was a great poem but that's not going to happen.
She's amazing I was overcome with emotions listening to her what a talent just beautiful.
She has my vote
This woman is going to be President.
Actions speak louder than words, even the most eloquent of speakers must prove themselves capable of backing up their claims through proactivity, though such an idea has been contradicted far too many times these past few decades. If she remains adamant to her principles in the event that she ever does enter politics, then she'll have gained more respect than any single wretch currently inhabiting D.C., otherwise she'll be indistinguishable from them. A talent in linguistics is just one desirable trait in leadership, but remember that a silver tongue can be just as dangerous as any single weapon, charisma is an especially effective tool used to beguile the masses to this very day.
Get your mouth off the crack pipe, dude!
Holy smokes, she‚Äôs beyond words.
@Manuel Hernandez never mind
Beyond what words?
@Manuel Hernandez She wrote the poem.
She can read and now she's a Star
A star is born!!
they said it right, black people can rhyme
A powerful message for all.
put a beat on it.
Affirmative action poet.
So extraordinary! I could watch it over and over.
She's no Maya Angelou
Tabula Rasa. They have a fixation with recruiting the young ones. These people are sick.
Great, here comes another another Greta Thunberg type.
So nice to see another USA.
Illegitimacy.
Help us to be brave enough to see it and brave enough to be it!!!

Who tf is this
@samIam because he can‚Äôt do anything himself, got it.
She is a poet that was invited to recite for the president elect of america.
sat year:2250 reading section passage 1
She has a soul like Maya Angelou
She is absolutely without a doubt, a racist white mans biggest fear.
I love her tribute to Maya Angelou in the ring she wore.
@bo pup Biden got ring to
@Denise Biden ring of approval
@bo pup Biden got the same ring
@bo pup - Awesome, I did not know that fact, thanks!

They forced themselves to the WH by stealing the election. FRAUD
queit isnt peace
Girl has listened to some Kate Tempest. 3
What does she describe herself as in the poem.
she speaks brilliantly with light and na√Øvete to a sea of criminals.
Stephen Couch you haven‚Äôt been on university campuses with all the snowflakes and lefties. I guess their parents educated them to be such?
@Robert Fabela there is a difference in knowledge based in facts and that based in opinion or interpretation. Now I agree when you have an extremist government the reliability of information would be problematic at best, but that‚Äôs still an extreme stance to take. Higher education isn‚Äôt out there twisting facts they would lose accreditation.
@Jeff the Indian Chief that‚Äôs true, however, I‚Äôm sure her Harvard education was legitimate.
@Stephen Couch It depends upon the credibility of one's instructor, not all educators are created equal after all. There is a reason why American educational institutions falter while other nations take the lead in topics like science  mathematics. There is no personalized education that compensates for one's weaknesses, and there are instructors that would much rather teach you how to think, not what to think.
And these traitorous criminals approve of every propagandist word coming out of her mouth.
@Stephen Couch education has always been filtered by the people in power. You think you would learn the truth/knowledge from the nazi party or the confederate party or from oil companies. EVERY human being on the planet has an opinion and it is very very difficult for knowledge to be shared unfiltered and in an unbiased manner.
@Sgt Koranflusher education doesn‚Äôt corrupt.
@Lena Price She's is ALREADY corrupted by her education/media/entertainment complex. And that is the reason she is even standing there.
You sound poetic.
That light and naivet√© is in most of us, when we first start off in our respective professions. However, many become corrupted due to the money, power and greed. It's always refreshing to see the young, full of hope and light. I see that Oprah has taken a strong interest in Amanda. Many will be drawn to Amanda because she has that spark, but there will also be many who are looking to use, exploit and take advantage of her.
PERIODT.
Fabulous!!!
she outshines the sun with her strength
A very wise, talented young lady. üëç‚òùÔ∏è
What kind of a person are you when you dislike a piece of art as this as is shown on the dislikes on this. Such sad miserable people in this world.
So stunning and brave. Everyone get on your knees and start worshiping her. ü§£
Thanks Amanda for your presence...
When day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade, the loss we carry a sea we must wade, we've braved the belly of the beast we've learned that quiet isn't always peace, and the norms and notions of what just is, isn't always just-ice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow we've, weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother, can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And yes we are far from polished far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect, we are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gaze not to what stands between us but to what stands before us, we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else, say this, is true. That even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that we'll forever by tied together victorious, not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we're to live up to our own time then victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we've made that is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it, because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it. We've have seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy, and this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth in this faith we trust for well we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption, we feared it in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so... while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert... how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us. We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be, a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around our interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blenders become their burdens. But one thing is certain... if we merge mercy with might and might with right then love becomes our legacy and change, our children's birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with, every breathe from my bronze-pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wonderous one, we will rise the from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the wind-swept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution, we will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sun-baked south, we will rebuild reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we, step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it, for there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it if only we are brave enough... to be it.
*If we're to live up to our own time then victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we've made that is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it, because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it.* Will you contribute to the repair or destruction. The question of our time.
i hope eventually she is in charge.
@Œ≤ud Small to make america to another third world shithole like africa? go for it! strong!
I do believe I heard her say she plans on running for President...around 2032 üëçüí™

Oh joy. Another no talent hack propped up by leftist media.
Go to work instead of complaining like asians
Absolutely beautifully said! You brought me to tears.
So beautiful, so much truth and love.
Teary-eyed and shivering. Thank you for the power and beauty of your words, Amanda Gorman.
Glorious. The ones who scroll on their mobiles: SMITE!
So eloquent  beautiful young lady
Amanda Gorman. Listening/watching your speech at Joe Biden's inauguration on the 20th of January Reduced me to tears. As an afro Caribbean person from the United kingdom üá¨üáß, I must say I am proud. I wasn't able to understand when Maya Angelou Recited her poem at bill clintons inauguration as i was so young. But i was able to witness yours and oh how powerful it was. I wish all the success I know you will go on to be one of the greats.
"A country that is bruised but whole" Absolutely beautiful.
@Reaver Red This is a poem written and performed by a gorgeous black woman. Maybe you misunderstood, America is bruised. We can't change the past but we work on the future. Bruised but whole, it's not racist, it's a beautiful line of poetry.
Sadly, the country is NOT whole. I hate lies.
@OnThe Right I was quoting from the poem. Every country is bruised, there's no where in the world that isn't. Try educating yourself there
Wow, was scrolling through comments and read this at the same time she said it üòÑ brilliant
Brilliant!!
Inspirational lady. I was I aw when i heard her. Amazing lady. A gift from God
It's more of a word slam than a poem, with all the fingers and stuff. hehe.
European's, Colonizer's, white Priveledged people, many ancestor's were the same people that took part in the Holocaust Astrocytes. They see that in people of color/Brown and Allie's are Voting liked nothing before. They feared loosing their Priveledged and to have a world on equal grounds".
Wonderful Words. Wonderful Ideals. Wonderful Respect. Wonderful Love. Wonderful Young Lady!
"a nation, that isn't broken, but simply unfinished..." A nation that is being reborn as a global nation of humans! There is only one nation. It is simply the world!
Amazing, a combination of Maya Angelou, Alan Ginsberg,  Pablo Neruda mixed with Tagore yet completely original. Amanda Gorman is a National Treasure.
Beautiful!
Subarashii..... Absolutely perfect 100%
sis really said "Biden, u have 4 years, this is my time to shine brighter than usual" lol!!!! she a queen y'all

Beautiful. And not just the poem
How can someone dislike this? I'm bewildered!
This will make history
She is so Special , She is so unique the way she Spoke, She is hope , She is one of kind. MY GOD BLESS YOU AMANDA.
Beautiful poem but tired of the media and propaganda that America is a racist nation. It is not. We have had a black president. We have black, hispanic and Asian senators so what am I missing? People of today should not be looking into the past but the future. Enough already we have moved on
@Betty Boop correct, everyone is racist to some level. Call it prejudice, bias, environmental, educational or human condition. A change of the human heart is needed. Tired of the media and government playing with our minds
Want to see real racism? Try walking through a black neighborhood at midnight üòÑ
God bless Joe Biden and give him good health and strength in Jesus name I prayer hallelujah amen
We are proud of you Amanda‚ù§‚ù§from South Africa üëèüëèüëè
BEAUTIFUL young lady and beautiful poem. BEAUTIFUL spirit and also humble. BLESSINGS on her life. And continue to move FORWARD
"We seek harm to none and harmony for all." "Victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we make." ***UNITED STATES*** Listen to this young beautiful woman who is OUR future. Edit : These are the words of a young woman who broke boundaries.
@Anouk A Newsflash, not the "empire" that has committed crimes. World peace, ha, laughable.....so all countries are on board to actually unite  agree. Ummm, no! If that was the case we wouldn't need a United Nations or peace treaty. We are far from perfect but you need to do your homework.....we are not holding up world peace, the people in the WHOLE world are doing so, the lack of unity, the refusal to let each be their own with no conflict....and on and on.....Tell her, young scholar....it is people like you that prevent and assume which only causes more chaos  we step back not forward.
@Anouk A Really? STFU! Tell that to young brilliant mind that will/is the future of the country. Find her IG  say it.....I will wait. This exactly what she is talking about
She dissected the words onto a puzzle and brought them together to show a different word and world together. Well done.
#propaganda
The head gear is as pretentious as the poem and the delivery.
@Austin - You ignorant putz. You have no idea who I am or what I have accomplished in my life or how many people I have helped.
@S955US84 No, jealous that you'll never achieve what she has achieved that day. You will be sad forever. I wish you luck.
@Nancy Sterck Zonnelied - maybe you are - but me jealous of that? Never
Jealous...
Beautiful words, beautiful person.
She is incredible
Wow
Nobody wanna hear dat crap
That was beautiful. I do take issue with one thing; "descended from slaves". Her descendants were enslaved, but that slavery is not our only history.
She's not ashamed of slave heritage! That's why she put it in there! Glad she did!
FFS
‚ÄúFinally, an inauguration video that doesn‚Äôt have a 1:123,445,678 like to dislike ratio‚Äù
"we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us." She IS the future, there is hope for America and all of us.
Not a big fan of slam poetry but this was subtle and well done.
A historic speech. At the exact right moment.
@Reaver Red when it was needed the most
"If we merge mercy with might and might with right...." üôè
i cant be the only one who kinda wants to hear this as a rap right?
is it just me or has anyone else noticed the divisiveness?
W.o.W.
two words. NAILED IT.
Kenneth on Good morning America at 3am,,said if you give the young people a chance you will be SURPRISE...All ColorsüòÇthey are the FutureüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wow, Outstanding Poem - so perfectly timed and reflective of the state of the US. I think I've listened to it a dozen times.
As a Scot, I'm not too fond of US American soppiness. IMHO, a touching poem needs something it's actually about, not just cheesy, big signal words to wallow in one's own sentiments. And I don't think this is about anything half-concrete. Edit: FYI, I'm a leftist. I just don't like the poem very much.
@Betty Boop It's not propaganda. It's much too vague to be. But not great poetry either.
Total propoganda bs for the Hallmark crowd

Rubbish. Amateurish and juvenile, anyone who thinks otherwise should seek out good poetry.
Why the 4.2k dislikes?
Only a fool would select a 22-year-old poet over a more mature poet. The proof? This girl's poem is embarrassingly bad. Trite, nonsensical, predictable and clumsy. Elementary school level writing. Sad!
@Bethelhem Gebeyaw It's not personal or political. It's just bad writing. Sleepy is sending a signal about putting young people in charge. But this perfectly illustrates why that is a bad idea. It is great to have a black woman as the poet laureate. I just feel that it should go to someone much older who has earned it, and is surely a way way wayyyyy better poet than this young lady. Anyway that is all a matter of taste. And I want you to know that -- American to American -- I respect your right to regard this as good poetry, and I love you for expressing your disagreement with me in a balanced, reasonable way. You are adorable and completely disarming. I am sorry I said your point was dumb. That was not nice and not true. I apologize.
@Bethelhem Gebeyaw Sorry, but that is a dumb point. I am not claiming to be a poet. I have not been chosen to read at an inaugural address. Regardless, I could do way better than this amateur.

Something about her thats making her shine...the Glow represents the Glory of Godüî•well done sis Love from Zimbabwe
As a grown-ass man, I can proudly say this brought tears to my eyes
assassass
Same, man... same.
Lol nice virtue signal bro
Me too !
A grown ass man still rocking a patrick star profile picture is what brings tears to my eyes. Have a good life, brother.
It moves hearts because it speaks to the truth we all want but may not know how to find again as Americans. It‚Äôs never about a person but the people.
Sounds like something Patrick would say
Well , me too brother .... in tears and grown ass as can be
I love her way of being, her words and expression of them. Bravo, young lady!
Bravo
We are entering into a new era and legacy. Let's make this universe , with out loosing it's glory it has.
Beyond her amazing words, her delivery was ...well I am speechless.
She‚Äôs amazing!!!
Beautiful, the words and the young lady!
Even if you don't understand every word, you should be able to grasp the overarching message. Anyone who feels the need to bash, insult, denigrate or impugn this lovely young lady and her positive words spoken on an auspicious occasion is truly a monster. Not to mention uneducated, small, bullish, racist and soulless.
shes the best
Stupid , annoying girl FAKE!!!!!
No matter democrat or repuplican, I wish you all a good 4 years. God bless and amen...üôè
It was the last act and I almost missed it but I heard it and walked immediately to the TV. I love the Gettysburg Address and the story behind it and it reminds me of it. Sublime.
she's amazing
What a biased so called poem.
I am not American, I'm a Scot but this beautiful young lady's words were earth shattering. If these words do not galvanise America to unite I don't know what will.
Thank you. Best wishes to those on the other side of the pond!
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Imagine spending the time to watch this masterpiece and still hitting the dislike button
Who tf would spend the time to watch it
IMPEACH Joe Malarkey, His Fraudulency, the illegitimate, installed puppet Stooge.
All that I needed to hear. Simply beautiful. Thank you Amanda.
Great speaker!!!üëçüëçThe highlight of the ceremony
I remember hearing her recite poetry a couple years ago when she became the first youth poet laureate. Not surprised at all that she's blowing up right now. I am impressed with how well she overcame that speech impediment, though! Check out the interview from 2018 with TODAY with Jenna Bush Hager; she couldn't pronounce "R" at all.
The references to what Lin Manuel Miranda wrote , it makes me want to cry even if I am not American This girl is just perfect ‚ù§
@kitt oohhh ok thank you for giving me this information and yes it was ‚ù§
Actually she was quoting George Washington‚Äôs Mount Vernon speech, (which Lin Manuel was also quoting!) Still a gorgeous poem regardless üíï
That was incredible.
Why am I crying? I'm not even American...
She's already an American treasure....like Maya Angelou and Robert Frost.
I thought she was so classy. Beautiful girl.
thats a girls looks is as beautiful as her intelligence
I believe she just changed the world üåé 01/20/21.
so we have 4k Thumbs down on this beautiful speech , sad that you wouldn't like this speech unless you are a white supremacist
One word . Amazing..
Stunningly beautiful in every way. She and her mother must be so proud.
wow
Dr of Death!
My poetry needs much improvement. There is a beauty in effortlessness. A Willie Mays catch.
Mr illegitimate President
Beautiful. Someone should put it on music
She will go down in history! Just wait... we will see more of this young lady in the future!
How we missed this beautiful country! Welcome back (:
@Reaver Red Was this meant to be an intelligent reply? If yes, I didn't get it (;
@thugrug We and most of the world leaders ignored Trump for the last 4 yrs. :D You are not the first country who voted for the wrong person and you will be not the last one! Keep save!!!
Danke- We are glad to be back and glad you waited for us. It has been a rough four years!

4,000 dislikes from bitter trump paper boys
Follow the sheep
I loved Amanda's original poem. She's a very talented writer, but even if one dislikes her work, why can't people take joy in her unifying message and the fact that she's a young woman, filled with hope and aspirations for America's future.
It isn't unifying though, is it. Come on really.
we get to elect the sales reps. for the powers that really run the country. small hats still in control
And just like that, she enters the history books and people's hearts.
@gloriamariadc Yeah, by insanity.
@gloriamariadc smh... Y'all need to get a grip.
Yes!!! As a real star!! (not a 'pop star'!)
@TB Wms Yup.
@freeclimb- God will judge us all. When that day comes, we'll see who's lost and who's saved.
@TB Wms A lost soul.
@freeclimb- I believe you mean "You're" and not "Your". What am I lost about?
@freeclimb- I am a Christian, so I only have one Savior and it's not Biden. I believe Biden and Harris will work very hard to fix so much that is currently broken in this country. I certainly hope they succeed.
@TB Wms Is this how your savior biden is going to make things better. https://youtu.be/n1QiulgahxU
Learn what a footnote is, because she doesn't even rank that high.
@TB Wms Your lost.
Shut up
And now you jinxed it cuz the comment section is still gonna exist in the future with everyone replying to you saying you‚Äôre wrong. Congratulations, you ruined the one chance black people had
@freeclimb- I'm not going to get caught up in political talking points, which are certainly not all accurate. I know what represents a true Christian and what doesn't. If you think Trump does, may God have mercy on you. I would put up Biden's character against Trump's any day. One thing I do know, we all have to reap what we sow and give an account of what we've done. Be blessed.
He's devil üòà.... your days is over son
@TB Wms So you think a clearly rascist biden represents good fruit???? Common man.... He braged about the incarceration of Black men for non violent offenses. Mr. poor people are just as smart as white people???? Trump, facilitated FOUR Middle East peace deals which people said would be impossible. Trump helped facilitate historic low unemployment for Blacks and other minorities. Black home ownership was at record highs. So yeah, I judge him (Trump) by the fruit of his works. The media told viscous lies about Trump to hinder and destroy him. Repeatedly took his words and comments out of context and mislead gullable people like you. If you think God has ordained biden to be president in the worst deception of the American people in the history of this country quite frankly you have a lot of soul searching to do. Just because YOU say Trump left in disgrace doesn't mean he did. You all said he wouldn't leave peacefully and he did. You all lied about him inciting violence when he clearly said to protest peaceably... You all make me sick and now you have the nerve to deify biden as some sort of twisted savior. Please don't, he's not and I judge you by your words and actions as rotten fruit for supporting this insanity.
@freeclimb- If you believe in God, you would be able to discern why Trump's presidency ended the way it did. The bible tells us, you will know them by their fruit. As a Christian, I presume you understand this passage of scripture. Please honestly tell me the type of fruit Trump represents and is it the type that Jesus would want us to become.
thats easy - after the demofascists delete the history they dont like - there's plenty of room in the book to fill - liars cheaters and theves ..
Not mine. Just a bunch of words... under the circumstances... it's meaningless.
freeclimb what are you actually trying to get at?
freeclimb so does yoursüò≠
@r o a c h e s Your reply makes no sense?
Tata shhh
freeclimb aww you‚Äôre so pressedüò´
@Tata Don't pay attention to those people, they like to deify those that think like them. It's mental illness really, just like Trump Derangement Syndrome where nothing he did could be construed as good. Now they show depictions of biden coming down from the heavens like a God. I realize it is extremely disturbing to see but it is the mental illness that is socialism. You see, if you don't belive in God, you'll believe in anything. Even a rascist old man who is clearly suffering from dementia as savior of their world view.
i'm not from america so pls explain like everyone who happened to dospeech at inauguration goes straight to history books? but like why? strangeü§î
freeclimb what‚Äôs funny??
Blahahahahaha..... blahahahahaha... That's funny.
I am guessing that all the dislikes are from the other party. This is a beautiful poem regardless
@Reaver Red Thanks for thinking about my future! I have no interest in politics my friend. Just took a wild guess as I stated in my comment. And to clarify as I‚Äôm reading and looking at my comment it was meant to say regardless what side you are on. üá∫üá∏ have the best life
She has the youth of Maya Angelou's spirit .. ‚ú®üëè
I was very impressed by that beautiful young lady and her poem, beautiful. Best wishes from Ireland.
Her voice and conviction woke me up. Bravo Amanda! Incredible woman you are!
Am proud to b A black.
More inspirational in 5 minutes than Melania will ever be.
After living on memes, the power of the well crafted, spoken word is shattering!
The only good comment I've read here.
@abahgus ok boomer
That's you're own fault you let cultural engineers program you.
no...it's *uplifting, healing, empowering!* But I get what your saying... üé§üí™üëç
What a steaming pile of rhyming and almost-rhyming platitudes! She's up front about her political ambitions. Looks like she's got what it takes. ¬† Getting down to reality:¬† "we must first put our differences aside" By impeaching the outgoing president? "We lay down our arms" By flooding the capital with troops?

I keep watching and listening to her recite her poem over and over in awe. Such beautiful words, such a talented mind, such a powerful performance. To the HATERS who disliked this video - I am VERY sad for you that your mind is so diminished with hatred that you fail to see the beauty, power, grace and hope.
Those dislike are basket of deplorable.
Care to elaborate? I mean what exactly makes you dislike the poem?
I consider myself to be rational way above the standard of an average stupid citizen, yet I hated every second of this. Seriously, if I was there, i would just cover my ears with every piece of fabric on me.
That's the passion of what America is all about that sets us apart!
She took my breath away! What a bright, intellligent and wonderful young lady! It makes me proud to be an American. She has wisdom beyond her years.
Magnificient
Youth is the future. I am going to find more of Amanda's work. Great sentiments and artistry.

"Quiet isn't always peace"...in quiet there is something raging inside just like a deep water stream that is calm and quiet on the surface but has a strong current in its depth...
Now, now Daisy, don't you go down that road too of trying to explain away the violence and intimidation of last summer. As if the deep-water stream can't help it, it's 'raging' currents beneath are part of its make-up. Well, that might be true for a deep-water stream, but humans have agency and morals. It's funny how the tens of thousands of young people involved in the street disturbances last year also seek their absolution. The poet's words from the pulpit are set to soothe their conscience, and console their raging minds. As if grandma would now understand (grandma who grew up with very little). The poet's words you quote tie in directly with the "No justice, no peace" cry out on the streets. Her words from the pulpit in front of the Capitol to America and the world (as she would have it) are a lecture, and a rather stern one at that. Her words are more shame-on-you-America-so-far than an appeal to all that has been good about America and for consequently for the world.
@freeclimblol. Yeah, I see what you mean. I just wanted to quote a book in relation to the subject ‚ú®üóø‚ú®
@Fritz Wulfhard Considering all the psudo intellectualizing going on It had to be said.
@freeclimb Well duh. Of course it is.
@Fritz Wulfhard Sometimes silence (or quiet) is just that, silence or quiet.
Silence can create its own violence.
School Libraries...
It depends on one's heart
No, sometimes "silence is violence" 21 pilots.

Have tears in my eyes just listening /watching
She is awesome.
Thank You, sister
All men need WOMEn like her1sT
She should be a speech writer
It was obvious that she would rap her "poem" and some Anti-American tards actually like it.
She's so amazing
She is fire *10
Ms. Gorman was a gift of light after an interminable period of racism, hatred, and abject incompetence. Contrast Ms. Gorman to the stylings of McEnany to see clearly the difference between the progress presented by the Democratic Party and retrogression of the once GOP.

If you listen to her words you would know.
Wow
This is beautiful . I was born and raised in this country I sang the national anthem and said the pledge of allegiance for 26 years of my life To be disowned in the only land I ever know is sad I was never welcomed was treated differently all the time . I'm proud to be who I am today . As an american asian muslim I was always living in terror because of ignorant hate threats towards me. I feel so proud of putting on my veil . Thank you Biden and kamala harris. For accepting and always mentioning different cultures and races . Land of the free! This is to the American people !
3:22 "History has it's eyes on us" sorry all I can hear is HamiltonüòÇ But really this was amazing. What an incredible young woman
She said in an interview she recited a part from Hamilton!! It went well with what she was describing
She's incredible, gracefully charming

She make satanic ritual....nothing nice... satanic ritual for cabala who keep the Earth in wars.
My goodness , i need Just one word on you to create my Future üôè congratulation
Does anybody else get the impression that this girl is all about style? I'm not saying there is no substance but I'm saying the emphasis is definitely on style. I think at her age she should be a little more low-key less intense - she can save the intensity for when she gets older. It would be more effective at that point in time rather than trying to sound like a famous orator at her age.
I love her beautiful yellow coat - she was definitely the much needed ray of sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è  üåª flower of Hope for everyone!
I loved you
happy day
AMANDA GORMAN, poema dito na tomada de posse do presidente Joe Biden, tradu√ß√£o de CARLOS CAMPOS A MONTANHA QUE ESCALAMOS Quando chega o dia, perguntamo-nos, onde podemos encontrar luz nesta sombra sem fim? A perda que carregamos, a travessia de um mar t√£o longo assim... Enfrent√°mos a besta de frente Aprendemos que a paz n√£o √© silente E que as normas e conceitos do que √© justo Nem sempre s√£o justi√ßa E ainda assim o amanhecer √© nosso antes de o sabermos De algum modo n√≥s fazemos De algum modo, n√≥s resistimos e testemunhamos uma na√ß√£o que n√£o est√° quebrada mas apenas inacabada. Somos os sucessores de um pa√≠s e de um tempo em que uma menina negra magrinha descendente de escravos e criada por uma m√£e solteira pode sonhar tornar-se presidente apenas para se encontrar recitando para um. E sim, estamos longe de ser polidos longe da pureza mas isso n√£o significa que estejamos a esfor√ßar-nos para formar uma uni√£o perfeita Estamos a esfor√ßar-nos para formar uma uni√£o com um prop√≥sito Para compor um pa√≠s comprometido com todas as culturas, cores, personagens e condi√ß√µes do homem E ent√£o levantamos os nossos olhares n√£o para quem est√° entre n√≥s mas para quem est√° diante de n√≥s Acabamos com a divis√£o porque sabemos que, para colocar o nosso futuro em primeiro lugar, devemos primeiro por de lado as nossas diferen√ßas Depomos as nossas armas para que possamos estender os nossos bra√ßos uns para os outros A ningu√©m desejamos mal, a todos desejamos harmonia Que o mundo diga pelo menos estas verdades: Que mesmo quando sofremos, crescemos Que mesmo em sofrimento, tivemos esperan√ßa Que mesmo cansados, tent√°mos Que estaremos para sempre ligados, vitoriosos N√£o porque nunca mais conheceremos a derrota mas porque nunca mais semearemos a divis√£o As Escrituras dizem-nos para imaginar que todos devem sentar-se √† sombra da sua videira e figueira E ningu√©m lhes causar√° medo Se quisermos viver o nosso pr√≥prio tempo Ent√£o a vit√≥ria n√£o estar√° na l√¢mina que brandirmos Mas em todas as pontes que construirmos Essa √© a promessa de clareira A montanha que escalamos Se ousamos √â porque ser americano √© mais do que um orgulho que herdamos, √© o passado de que fazemos parte e o modo como o reparamos Vimos uma for√ßa que destruiria nossa na√ß√£o ao inv√©s de a partilhar Destruiria o nosso pa√≠s se significasse adiar a democracia E esse esfor√ßo quase teve sucesso Mas embora a democracia possa ser periodicamente adiada nunca pode ser permanentemente derrotada Nesta verdade nesta f√© n√≥s confiamos Porque enquanto tivermos os olhos no futuro a hist√≥ria olhar√° por n√≥s Esta √© a era da reden√ß√£o justa Tememos quando come√ßou N√£o nos sent√≠amos preparados para ser os herdeiros de uma hora t√£o terr√≠vel mas no √≠ntimo encontr√°mos a for√ßa para escrever um novo cap√≠tulo Para oferecer esperan√ßa e risos a n√≥s mesmos. Enquanto antes pergunt√°vamos, como poder√≠amos prevalecer sobre a cat√°strofe? Agora n√≥s afirmamos Como pode a cat√°strofe prevalecer sobre n√≥s? N√£o vamos marchar de volta para o passado mas para o que deve ser Um pa√≠s ferido, mas inteiro, benevolente, mas ousado, feroz e livre. N√£o seremos mandados para tr√°s ou barrados pela intimida√ß√£o porque sabemos que a nossa omiss√£o e in√©rcia ser√° a heran√ßa da pr√≥xima gera√ß√£o Os nossos erros ser√£o os seus fardos Mas uma coisa √© certa: Se fundirmos miseric√≥rdia com poder, e o poder com o Direito, ent√£o o amor ser√° o nosso legado e mudar√° o destino dos nossos filhos Deixemos para tr√°s um pa√≠s melhor do que aquele que nos deixaram Em cada respira√ß√£o do meu peito de bronze, Ergueremos este mundo ferido para um mundo maravilhoso Erguer-nos-emos das montanhas douradas do oeste, Erguerer-nos-emos do nordeste varrido pelo vento, onde nossos antepassados fizeram a revolu√ß√£o pela primeira vez Erguer-nos-emos das cidades junto aos lagos dos estados do centro-oeste, Erguer-nos-emos do sul queimado pelo sol Reconstruiremos, reconciliaremos, recuperaremos e em cada canto conhecido de nossa na√ß√£o e em cada esquina do nosso pa√≠s, o nosso povo diverso e belo surgir√°, batido e belo. Quando chega o dia, sa√≠mos da sombra, com vigor e sem medo O novo amanhecer floresce √† medida que o libertamos Pois h√° sempre luz, se tivermos a coragem para a ver se tivermos coragem para a ser. * THE MOUNTAIN WE CLIMB When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn't always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we'll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we're to live up to our own time Then victory won't lie in the blade But in all the bridges we've made That is the promise to glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it If only we're brave enough to be it Para ouvir este poema dito por AMANDA GORMAN https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNFAICB8vxwfeature=youtu.be * in https://www.facebook.com/quem.le.sophia.de.mello.breyner.andresen/photos/a.114014221967684/3642517059117365/

THAT WAS INSPIRING!! HELL, EVEN THE YELLOW WAS UPLIFTING, WASN'T IT!?! YEP! THANKS FOR IT.

Your words give hope to generations and your poem was the highlight of the whole event. If we merge the light, the might and the rights, we will all have a future. God bless you, Amanda!
This 22-year-old absolutely left my Ghasted-flabbered. Unfortunately however, l am Reminded of the difference between her and another 22-year-old - Mira Ponsetta, privileged, pampered, clueless who tackled a 14-year-old Black Child in a hotel lobby IN FRONT OF HIS FATHER, accusing his of stealing her phone, then went on national TV to describe herself as ‚Äúsuper-sweet‚Äù while refusing to acknowledge her crime. Amanda Gorman, I‚Äôm trying to catch my breath!! Phew!!
I've had tears in my eyes. So powerful. I'm satisfied.
Poetry matters.
Robert Frost is smiling as this 22 Year Old as a Graduate of Harvard University gave America Hope for the Future. Our future is very promising as people like Amanda Gorman see the "Truth about the American-experience" moving forward. "God Bless the World with Love and Reconciliation." The future is transparent with democracy  freedom. T J (Tom) Vanderloop, Author, Teacher  a Manufacturing Engineer/Consultant to Industry
I wouldn't compare this to Robert Frost or Maya Angelou.

These are the viral videos our planet needs. A moment when technology and internet platforms are useful and needed. No lies or hateful rhetoric. Just a realistic and optimistic view of our human condition. I didn't see anyone percolating into a violent frenzy. Instead, I saw many in the solace of deep reflection and humility. It was the time to ponder who we are and what we are doing. The insurrection was initiated by those who chose to follow and believe hateful OPINIONATED tweets or videos. This video allows you to discern and choose your own path. I'm choosing to change the channel. To those platforms which allow me to learn and absorb FACTS. Thereafter, promote me to independently seek additional facts through other outlets to make MY decisions in life. Nothing wrong with being a follower........if you follow the facts.
What a pleasure to see inclusion, decency and kindness. It was a delight to meet Amanda Gorman. who is stunningly brilliant in her words and delivery. I will be hoping to read any of her poems. If she continues to write, it will be a gift to all of us.
Am really happy and proud of you Amanda may God continue to protect you and bless you may you leave long to be honest Coming American president in Time to come much love stay safe
Beautiful
omg wow... how gracious and beautiful
"quiet isn't always peace"
When she said the phrase we shall rise I got Goosebumps all over
@leah fontaine if you did some research you would see that she was a speaker at Harvard University and many significant events she's a role model for the young people
stop the coke.
Absolutely superb
Read the constitution. The bill of rights is for all citizens.
Biden begins his questionable presidential term with more self-righteous harping on the slavery that ended in America 150 years ago. Slavery that ended because thousands of white Americans fought and died in agony on 19th century battlefields to end it. Meanwhile, Beijing Biden has lined his pockets for decades with the profits of actual modern slavery in China. The hypocrisy and disconnect is grotesque.
@Betty Boop Biden has no financial linking to China. This isn‚Äôt from a political source, this is just a fact. No evidence has ever accused him of that, no evidence has pointed at that, no investigation has ever occurred on those allegations. And that‚Äôs because it never happened. Don‚Äôt act as if a politically motivated accusation is true just because someone said it.
It is completely true do some research outside of CNN
That simply isn‚Äôt true
Actions speak louder than words.
@Skipper Russell True, however that is a matter of individual perspective.
@HŒûLIZ And those actions can be detrimental.
True, however words often inspire actions.
Fun fact: she graduated from Harvard
Wow, what an honor to see history being made. Congratulations Amanda!
You will see the truth soon.
The most memorable moment of that inauguration was her reciting this poem breathtaking
She was at BLM in Boston last summer.
Someone speaking with that much eloquence, beauty and soul almost offset the ugly, joyless stupidity that's dominated the last four years. But, we must never forget what happens when elect a clown off the TV.
An election that needs investigating. Has there been foul play in he vote counting? Democracy demands transparency.
@HŒûLIZ Where were they thrown out? Can you send me a link or summary? That would be helpful, thanks again
@OzricAurora Can you point me towards some of these? That would be very helpful, thanks.
@Nigel Anderson ‚Äúthe investigation‚Äù? They tried starting 60 of them but all were thrown out because they had neither a clear accusation or evidence. This is all public record.
@Nigel Anderson Maybe do the research yourself. There's loads of articles.
@OzricAurora Thanks for that, can you show me the full report on the investigation, or a link to the investigation?
It was investigated. Where have you been the last two and a half months?
I think President Biden should give her a position in his cabinet the spirit of Martin Luther King is inside her absolutely and epic poet and hopefully ready one day to take the oath of office
plot twist : its the democrats that keep racism thriving to control the minorities.
@blast you clearly aren‚Äôt black, the changes are evident.
@HŒûLIZ just look at the Biden and Harris careers. they were never qualified to take office. Urban blacks and poc have been voting democrat for 50 yrs and nothings changed, probably even worse. every four years they rile up the blm crowd to get the black vote for their candidates.
ü§® um... sure about that?
Bla bla bla bla
Very good young lady
Never sow division
It is all based off of emotionalism for them, but that which strikes your feelings shouldn't trump the common sense and business like mindset it takes to run this country.
I wonder if Amanda Gorman knows Racist Joe said he didn't want his kids growing up in a jungle? Referring to racially integrated schools. Of course not. Because the Democrat Party has brainwashed African Americans all for their vote.
TEACH!
No, times change, and people change with it. Biden has clearly shown to be a ally to minorities.
FRAUDULENT!-
Beautiful inspirational kissed by heavenly spirits üôèüèΩ thank you
Where are the First Peoples?
3 of my classes today needed me to watch this video today- ü•≤
goosebumps, is the word!
First stupid ass move from idiot Dementia Joe was to open up travel from hostile countries like Iran. Now they can send any terrorist here to take revenge. And why did he do it? Because its more important to Dementia Joe to be PC than to protect American lives. Now he put us all at risk and the blood will be on his hands not if, but when we are attacked again on US soil! Well done Liberals.
@fen fen And you realize it was Biden who voted for the Iraq war, and has been part of the military industrial complex in Washington for decades causing those wars abroad. I voted for Trump to keep us out of war, and he did. The four years of peace are over, the swamp is back. Get ready for more wars.
if this is what we are going to see over and over and over and over again? what ever company makes barf bags please crank up your manufacturing line, because we the people will be barfing up our collective guts. this phony crap being splattered all over the media, we are going to need a whole bunch of barf bags.
The sappy stuff is just on Inauguration Day. It‚Äôs meant to ease people around the country who are worried about the new President
Beautiful young lady.so inspiring and gives us ALL hope.
For one thing... ONE GOD.
That was excellent!
EARTH......were is corona.
Colorless.
Poet is a poet.
The words, the expression, the words. Listen everyone, every American. Put your foolishness aside. At the end of the day the divisiveness is not worth it. See how many are now placed on no-fly list, see how many may face long prison terms. It is not worth it. Let's move forward.
Not quite up there with John Betjeman, but it was OK.
English Teachers from now on and so on: "Class, kindly write a 5-page reaction paper about the speech of Amanda Gorman during the 2021 Inauguration" ü§£ü§£ü§£

I‚Äôm doing it right now! In a Mexican School here en Mexico City haha
My teacher already got me writing a essay on it right now.
Im here rushing to dis and its due at 8 am!!
Pro liberal reactions only
I am having a lesson rn about it :D
same kek
God damn it!! Ihave to do it right now
@kat same here
LOL HOW DID YOU KNOW
what do you mean 2022? we are doing this in AP Lit today
We are happy she is wearing the colours of my country üá©üá™ She does really introduce the new President Biden in a worthy way, preparing us to get ready for what's to come...
Yes, the colors of another country
The words of a young girl indoctrinated into hatred and victimhood mentality elevated to thought leader. How sad and racist. That was a speech, not a poem.
@Aaron Ede ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ okay you didn‚Äôt even listen to her poem, I completely understand what you‚Äôre talking about, and I hate when people do that, but there was no Victimhood or demonization.
@HŒûLIZ Your words, "don‚Äôt act like you can judge her brilliance in any way, shape or form." She's not brilliant at all. She's an ideologue. She's a a lazy thinker as is typical of all ideologues. She's carrying water for a rotten ideology whose central tenet is victimhood. Any ideology that preaches victimhood as virtue and demonizes people based on group identity is evil. Her ideology is the same model as that of every oppressor group that has ever existed. She and her ilk are well on their way to doing very evil things.
@Aaron Ede when did I ever say her ideas weren‚Äôt debatable? I said that her brilliance was undebatable. Explaining unity and it‚Äôs purpose, and ‚Äúthe hill we climb‚Äù to become a better people for future generations, isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbigoted and grotesque‚Äù nor is it ‚Äúgross‚Äù so it‚Äôs unclear why you would think that.
@HŒûLIZ She's 22. I can definitely judge her and challenge her ideas and words in many obvious ways. The idea that her ideas aren't debatable is fully authoritarian, illiberal, anti-intellectual and absurd. She's hustling hate and not much else. Her speech is peppered with bigoted and grotesque ideas. It was gross.
While a speech has a set purpose and a motivating factor, a poem is an art form which uses words to express a transcending idea. This young girl is a youth laureate, don‚Äôt act like you can judge her brilliance in any way, shape or form.
4 years of darkness, now the shadow of hope kindle in the horizon... Congratulation American People as a new chapter of your history begins....
The 3.7K who dislike this video thank you for listening. I know you heard.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop I am a doctor.
@Reaver Red Well said, Sir!
True
@Vania Elizabeth Espinoza False hope is NOT a good thing. In many cases it's just a denial of reality. And when you're in denial about reality, you can't think critically. America is in a state of emergency and the sheep would rather be recipients of some flowery words delivered by an adorable little girl who has not truly found her voice yet - the one that speaks truth to power. ONLY by speaking truth to power and inspiring people to actually take constructive action will there be change (for the better) in America. People are very carefully selected to give speeches/perform at the inaugurals and are told why they can and CANNOT say. They have to tread very lightly (edit themselves), be weak and/or deliver flowery word salads.
I certainly don‚Äôt like Trump or think he was a in any way acceptable as a President, but the fact is 75 million of your fellow citizens voted for him. To talk about ‚Äúbraving the belly of the beast‚Äù because you side didn‚Äôt win last time is insulting to your country and democracy.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop I do not like most of what she does. I did like this song though.
You absolutely heard, JLo and Gaga too...THIS LAND was made for you and ME!
What is wrong with all you people on this comment thread. Where is the hope that things are going to get better?

Amazing, beautiful.
Oooh so touching
This was a good performance of an inauguration.. you all will see soon.. this was a fictional performance
In one Word, MAGIC. This is AMERICA-Great- !!!!!!
I don't think I've heard anything more moving
Absolutely beautiful I felt like crying listening to her
Wow, bars after bars after bars in her poem. The next Maya Angelou, we've been waiting for you!
If only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it , if only brave enough to do it in Jesus name Amen
what is that fake jesus has to do with this?where is he? where is he at to save us all?
Oh wow. She‚Äôs openly talking about killing white people on inauguration day.
Well, Trump talked about killing black people and Mexicans when he was inaugurated, and openly admired Hitler, so this is just balancing.

I'm Indian, Kamlaa Harrison is half Indian.... I think she sold her soul to the devil..... I only believe in Christ Jesus

Ooh dare God bless Americans more and more and hlep my country Uganda
I don't see her wearing a mask, sorry not sorry if im not using the proper pronoun.
Trump supporters try to review-bomb this, but unfortunately for Trump he only has 3.6K supporters in total
Saw that too lol, always funny to see the review bombs like it matters at all to any sensible person with intelligence.
Kamala Harrison is not African American She is half Indian and half Jamaican
@Rasheda Hinkle BECAUSE SHE IS BIRACIAL NOT BLACK!!!!
and why was that important??
She still half black then if she's Jamaican
Amanda you remind me of Maya Angelou, one of my favourite poem writers. You have a wisdom which is incredible and the beauty of your words are touching. May all that you've said come true and may your birthrights never be forgotten!
I did not vote for Biden. I do respect him as our President because the office deserves respect. This young American is beautiful as are her words. Please Americans don't look back, look forward, heed the words of unity spoken at this inauguration. As an American who spent her childhood on military bases, my father gave 21 years of service, I know what a United America looks like. No matter where we came from, no matter our ethnicity, no matter our religion or politics, we all lived as one.
Incredible message delivered with poise, grace, and passion!
Dumb... all I heard was üò≠üò≠üò≠ I WANT FREE STUFF
You ain‚Äôt black
I'm proud of you Amanda
Thank you Amanda Gorman. Your words. Your voice. Your vision. I feel privileged to have listened to your recitation of thoughts and witnessed your wisdom.
Finally, once again, proud to be American. She was stunning and awesome!
@Encore Baby Being present and being engrained in culture is two different things. Out of all the European nations, France is likely the only one whose culture and identity revolves around the ideals of enlightnment which from top to bottom make up American identity.
@Encore Baby being American means: Pro Democracy Pro Dialogue  Debate Anti-Violence of any form Pro Science Pro Humanitarian Pro Liberty  Human Rights Freedom of Speech Freedom of Movement Freedom of Opinion Freedom of Press Freedom of Ownership Federal Policy The Many to the Few, and vice versa One world, one love Respect to every culture To Dream big and not get comfy to less Hi from Greece, the origin of the American Dream
@Encore Baby how about you just leave
Stunning and Brave!!
I STRAIGHT CRIED,I WAS DEPRESSED AND FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF,THANK YOU PRINCESS NO MORE PITY PARTIES FOR ME.
Please take care of yourself.
The whole thing was a pretty boring and pathetic........................
Just want to share: We purchased our Official Historic Presentations of the entire inaugural events and other items of President Biden and Vice President Harris from Biden Inaugural Store at @t Restoring peace and President Biden speak like an eloquent leader. We received our historic glassware and they are very nice.
Ya stuttering biden is eloquent
Wow what a breathtaking message
I love the hamilton references
Thanks dear
your past is war and money, no matter what you do, it will be your future too.
I don‚Äôt see any Asian American or Middle Eastern American. Why? Because they‚Äôre strong and comfortable in they‚Äôre own skin. The loudest one in the room, is always the weakest one!
Wonderful- heartfelt best wishes from the U.K. - So glad to see America back in the family where it belongs
I would vote for this young woman.
She spitting bars
Jill Biden was married to Joe Biden's best friend . Jill Biden cheated on her husband with Joe Biden . Only a low life would bang his best friends wife
You are aware of Trump's track record with women aren't you?!
and how many wives has the donald had? greg you're a fool
A force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it
Every nation want have future, should have like her. God bless her

Like a Brazilian I hope that we can kick Bolsonaro's and his diabolic crew in the butt like you did with Trump, and also that we can raise a good leader that can unite with love, and demolish the old paradigms, make a racial and social just true democracy. But I also hope that Biden change the way that US make politics in other Country's, no more tyranny, no more domination. The world urges for world cooperation. Let's change this rude and raw democracy.

This may be the new Maya Angelo.......
Just beautiful !
Maya Angelou reborn.
This was so incredible! What an amazing woman!
They get her to help fool us. She black but the ones who got her are NOT!! PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE DONT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE OR FALSE HOPE
How refreshing! Someone who THINKS/KNOWS. This is the INOCULATION poem - inoculation against (truly hearing) the truth. Truth is "spoken" without saying a word. The girl looked lovely in the color of optimism (yellow), quite neat and cute, but the poem was just a flowery word salad. Edible flowers of the false-hope kind. They're (those in power) saying, "Here, ADOS sheep (and other gullible Americans), chew on this."..."while we fool you AGAIN."
Alright, who's the comedian that put her up to this, and where is the beatnik in the turtleneck with the bongos? üòÇ

they can have their cake and eat it too! be careful what you wish for....
Yeah, also Joe Biden persecuted blacks for his entire career, but lets just skip that.
TELL it! And CONmala does not like ADOS Blacks, she only slept with one (Da Mayor) so she could get further in her career. Most Brahmin don't like Black people...no matter what their lineage.
Drakes ghost writer taking notes üìù
Her staccato, movement, imagery, turn of phrase, so beautifully orchestrated. Her mouth a symphony of the future American voice.
Quick one before watching this: did she twerk?
When is she running for president?
When she has enough POLITICAL experience?
Brava Amanda! Da Italia, Lago di Como.
Extremely charged and a poem that just increased division in this nation
This is propaganda for Blacks, saying basically everything is ok now that the Democrats have stolen the election and taken over so go back to your daily lives and don't notice the fact that we they are going to do absolutely nothing for you....But don't worry, in 3 1/2 years from now Police Brutality will be back on your T.V. screens and we will be promising you the world again if only we can have your vote....

Fantastic

I don‚Äôt now inglish but she say something good 100% I think
Nicely done, but I fail to understand what all the fuzz is about. ¬¥Obama's inauguration featured a great inspirational poem, as well.
Shall I despise the type of people who give this a thumb down, or feel sorry for them? Or simply ignore their existence...

Perfect! I could listen to her words all day. Amanda, you have renewed my faith in poetry and the uplifting power of language. Thank you for my favourite part of the Inauguration.
üò≠‚ù§phenomenally executed ‚ù§
Wow. Well done.
Wow ad coming good
Joe Biden is not a president of the United States of America. He was sworn in ten minutes early. That is, according to him. Twentieth Amendment "https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-20/" is not a president. The president-elect has to be on the dot on Jan. 20. at 12:00 noon. I suspect that the United States of America is under military control.
@steelboss, why do you still answer me? :D Great that you know. I make no secret of it.
@Siri B. you are completely boring. I am done.
@steelbossA-ha, you‚Äôre already thinking about the wedding. That's great that you said it.
@Siri B. you want me? U want to try? You want to see it?
@steelboss, Babe! Anyone who justifies himself will accuse himself. ;*
@Siri B. no I don‚Äôt like little pickles. You are a little pickle. Maybe your mommy likes little pickles. Why don‚Äôt u go watch cartoons?
@steelboss, nice, that you like little pickles. :*
@Siri B. yea, only a little pickle. No real meat. Sounds like a very small problem.
@steelboss, but maybe vegetables like pickle. ;*

Not great. Trying too hard to be the next Maya Angelou.
Grausiger Propaganda Dreck
Lets hope she is not the next "Greta Thunderberg"... just used to push forward an agenda. Usually every "look, here is a sensation, lets show her on all television channels" people turn out this way.
The "new dawn balloons?" That makes no sense, is a bad metaphor. She wasn't that good.
@XLT 20g571 your opinion, my bad..
@Rasheda Hinkle Why hater? I'm just pointing out if you are delivering poetry at an inauguration and are supposedly that good, you shouldn't be making mistakes like that. It should be perfect.
hater!!
Omg, in 5 seconds she showed more poise, elegance, intelligence, and leadership than the Fat Cheeto showed in his entire life!
Voice of reason and a breath of freshness........ She spoke every word of hope and pride to what #45 was trying to desecrate.
Note... this woman has worked hard (and still works on it to this day) to overcome a speech impediment AND she is a Harvard graduate!!
ü§Æü§¢ü§Æü§¢ü§Æ
My guess would be 90% of the people who didn‚Äôt like it probably didn‚Äôt understand it and the other 10% are just haters. It was an amazing use of alliteration and current events wrapped into one. EVERY word had meaning and it was POWERFUL and needed to be said. This was the highlight of the day and 50 years from now people will study this work for a greater understanding of this current time. Amazing and I hope you get more opportunities to speak because you are the hope and voice of the future.
This woman is AMAZING!!!!!!! I am so proud of her! #BlackGirlMagic ü§©
Can we talk about how good that yellow jacket looks?
That‚Äôs was the only Good thing that came out of this.

I did not vote for Biden, but I am happy to see this young lady speak so beautifully. This is an example to young people to move away from all the "likes" and "ums". An example of rhetoric and using a positive message to "rebuild and reconcile" as she so beautifully put.
Amazing !
A very Eloquent and words of hope delivery..
Bravo
Imagine a rap song like this- :o
!!!!! USA IS BACK TO THE WORLD. CONGRATs AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOUR COUNTRY IS FULL OF PRECIOUS GEMS !!!!!
Wow, imagine being her parents! So talented and beautiful! I was smiling the whole time she was reciting.
In her poem, she said "We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one" She is going to run for president in 2036. Her first opportunity when she will be 38 years old. Bravo to Ms. Gorman and her mother.
Flawless
"We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms." Is America and the world listening?
That's cheap talk after the last four years of liberal hysteria. Hard to take anything serious from this group after all the bs we have heard from them. The same people enabled mentally ill people to feel justified to physically assault an innocent stranger because they were wearing a Maga hat.
My just one of my favorite parts of the poem
Yes and i can tell you that usa bombarded yemen and libia . Thank you obama. Wonderful poet ok but when you slaughter 50 k civilians in north africa everything falls appart
If I had a voice like that I'd be so happy, if I had confidence like that.. wait I never will-

If that was my daughter i would be a proud dad. America congratulations
@Glenda Stevens With young women like that my faith in America is returning. PS all the best from the Netherlands.
Sadly, her father abandoned his family and her mom raised her alone in California. Her mom is an English teacher and worked hard to see her daughter graduate from Harvard and become a poet laureate. When Oprah contacted Amanda before the inauguration and told her that she wanted to send her the perfect coat and dress for the ceremony, Amanda said "Thanks Ms. Winfrey, but I already have my coat and dress picked out. LOL --She's a boss!
And tomorrow she will be forgotten ..
Actually, that's untrue. Her books (that haven't been released) were already "best sellers" in terms of pending sales and she was offered a tenured-track professorship position at a historically Black college (Morgan State University) yesterday. Keep in mind, she's only 22 and just graduated from Harvard. She has achieved more in 22 years than what most will achieve in a lifetime. My guess is Amanda will ride the wave and make a few million with several additional book deals...
Merci beaucoup, merci !
I'm not American - Swedish. But, Wow! I watch this young girl with tears in my eyes. There's still hope for America. I hope to live until she becomes POTUS.

Such eloquence and wisdom from one so young . She stole the show !
What A Beautiful Profound Narrative From A Beautiful 22yr Old Young Girl......
What an awesome poem from such a beautiful and articulate young lady. Our children are our hope for this country and for the world. I wish everyone peace , prosperity and love to everyone.
Beautiful and Powerful!!! An excellent recital. My congratulations to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on this auspicious day. I sincerely hope the United States of America will be able to heal itself and that Equality, and Justice prevail and overcome the selfishness and fear. I hope the United States of America will now see the recent past 4 years as a call for a better future. My Very Best Wishes to the United States of America.
THE BEST EVER...She easily outshone Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez, just marvelous!
That recital erased the surreal cruelty , cynicism, name calling  violence of the last 4 years . Almost !!
She is inspirational
This was a regime change not an inauguration. No wonder they had to ballot harvest. Good grief!
'Invictus' and 'I have a dream' beautiful merged by a new generation.

Wonderful and the right choice First Lady Biden......to select Amanada Gorman Youth Poet Laureate of 2017 to bring forth her powerful words that are just right for this time...and this young woman overcame a speech impediment....... rock on Amanda!
Her hands dance. Graceful. Like a ballet. I hung on her every word. Magical.
yes. Notice the best singers: their hands also dance in a similar way, framing the note runs and melody/harmonies. Amanda's hands *frame her ideals.* It's regal, eloquent, compelling!üé§üí™üëç
If she is our youth, our future is assured.
I had to really hold back the tears here... This girl is talented, and the fact that she is allowed to stand there, that she is _invited_ to stand there is something we should never take for granted, but cherish and make sure that someday that many more like her may stand in positions like this

Amanda Gorman, I shall remember your name because you NAILED IT!! In view of the past 5 years and an failed coop, you put into words how our democracy is fragile, but we stood up to the darkness and must learn from what happened and we must continue to grow as a people from it. And so much more must be done to make the United States Constitution more than eloquent words on paper, it must embody all its rainbow of citizens so they can reap the rewards of life, liberty and the persuit of happiness. Happy New Day fellow citizens. We deserve it.‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÑüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

0:52 America, you great unfinished symphony? I admit I find patriotism to be a nearly uniformally bad thing, but I guess in something like this (as in the show it reminded me of), it's par for the course.
This resonates because it has God‚Äôs Truth all over it! ‚ÄúBut everyone shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree, And no one shall make them afraid; For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.‚ÄùMicah‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠4:4‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨ The Hill we climb refers to: ‚ÄúWho may ascend the hill of the LORD?

@Sgt Koranflusher yea everybody who doesn't agree or do what trump says is a traitorFrom the courts to the supreme courts,how convineint
@David Owens No dummy. Marxism infiltrated democrats, media and education as a platform to launch an attack on America. A corrupt congress, with republican sellouts, the blackmailed and neocon traitors along with the Judicial branches has aided them in the theft and election fraud. The Establishment stole this election for Biden. Biden is their useful idiot of the day. It's the People's right and duty to do something because there is no alternative in the courts. The Founding Fathers expected this would happen and ensured that at least the People would have the 2nd Amendment to help them. Our forefathers would STILL be at the Capitol. YOU are a traitor.
@sonicnator The that last thing we need to do now that our republic has been stolen from Americans by these globalist marxist interlopers is appease them. They don't want to work with us, no matter what they may say, and it is to our detriment to try work them in any way. There will be war or there will "the Hunger Games" scenario in America coming. The way we react now, decides this.
@Sgt Koranflusher Crazy statement like that are what caused some unhinged people to try to overthrow the government.
@Sgt Koranflusher we have a destructive past indeed, and we should be learning from it every day. That being said, we also have a past that we can look at as a source of inspiration
@Sgt Koranflusher and believe or not, I share that same concern with you. I‚Äôm no Biden fan (quite conservative leaning actually) but I felt that much of what was said in this woman‚Äôs poem can and does ring true for Americans of all stripes and political orientations. We can learn a lot from this. I hope Biden does too.
@Tasneem Alizerig You should be ashamed of your name after all the atrocities Mohamed did to people in his day.... like murdering those poets who he didn't like. Or did you not know that Mohamed was a murderer of poets? It is written about quite extensively. In hadith and by Ibn Ishaq in his book written in about 750 ad. I'm sure the black poet we are all talking about here would love to know about Mohamed sending his men in to slaughter one poetess in her bed asleep with her children as they ran their swords through them. Those are FACTS folks...and you would all know it if you were taught your history correctly.
@Tasneem Alizerig The book of PEACE what a FREAKING JOKE
But Biden is just stepping all over the American past like the idiot marxist destroyer he is playing these days.
This impacted me so much. One of the most beautiful things I‚Äôve heard
It's not just her words, but how she's speaking them. Her hand gestures, eye contact, facial expressions. Already a master of public speaking.
@John o Shea Hello there, how are you doing today? Thanks for being a fan, I really enjoy your comments. Yes I would love to visit someday Mr James and Thanks for your love and support. God bless you!

YES INDEED
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Mopping the floors and mowing the lawn sounds good, seniors his age need to stay active and get plenty of sun. ; )
@Lucy Ren√©e I agree with much of your comment.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop LOL. Right?!
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Right?! It's so damned easy to hoodwink people. Especially when they are wading in the waters of denial. The talk was indeed nonsense. Another distraction for those weaklings who believe/pretend that ignorance is bliss.
@freeclimb WORD! Now, THAT is a mic drop, free climb(!), not the flowery words of that poem. The girl is quite cute and was dressed nicely. She looked absolutely adorable, but she doesn't hold a candle to the (young) Lauryn Hill or Tamika Mallory - back in the day or today. Those who would speak truth to power (like Lauryn and Tamika or the likes of the late Tupac) would never be allowed to grace the stage at an inaugural. Lauren Hill and Tamika Mallory were/are powerful (and gorgeous) ladies who didn't/don't need to move their hands like they're sign language interpreters or trying to cast a spell in order to get a point across via poetry or song. This girl's hand movements are far too excessive. But, I'm sure she thought if she packed the performance with lots of hand movement, it would help that very mediocre speech.¬† Again, she looked very cute, people. However, the poem was not appropriate for the times. We need to be REAL and inspire REAL change. As Anita Baker said/sang in of her great songs, "No fairy tales." This is not the time to soft shoe and tap dance.
@Emily Rockefeller Yeah, yeah, yeah, Em. üòé I'm so immature I actually dare to criticize a public performance. God knows that's almost never done. Lol. Why didn't you toss in racist while you were at it, you of small brain? You're a riot. You lob nonsensical attacks at me, all the while knowing nothing about me (and if you did know, you might be embarrassed, though as smug as you appear to be, I doubt it). Let's see. To the noted moralist, EMILY ROCKEFELLER, any criticism, however fair and credible it may be, is picking on someone, thus Em's attempt to bully said critic into silence. Won't happen, so save those little fingers. Btw, Amanda isn't even close to perfect.
@MC I was wondering when the race card would be played. LOL For your edification, I'd make the same observation if she were seventy and purple. A performance is a performance.
@Emily Rockefeller Really? That's your brilliant, erudite, comment? Well you will have the funniest comment of the day, that's a certainty. Maybe the week! With your bad punctuation, Em, I'll surely heed that asinine comment. I'd mention "colloquialism", but it might get your brain all.fried.
@freeclimb and the rest of the commenters throwing mud. Right wing and a undertone of racism as that is the only reason to attempt to attack a brilliant performance. You don‚Äôt like the color of her skin, diversity, unity, or equality. You cannot appreciate excellence in creativity in expression because you do not understand it and what‚Äôs worse you don‚Äôt care to. Your mind is controlled by the right wing conspiracy theorist of Fox News and Trump. Summary, your mind is gone. Your a foolish puppet and your don‚Äôt even know it. Simply put, your stupid enough to be manipulated by a con artist. A fools comments have no value or merit to me .
@Bitfire31337 There is still a constitution that says anyone has the right to express their OPIONION backed by science or not. If that's how you chose to express yours that's on you.
look whose accusiing someone of crying
If you want to see hand gestures and facial expressions with piercing eye contact, hell all you had to do is have a conversation with my Puerto Rican Grandmother. Now that is a woman that knows how to make her meaning clear.
@MC I think you just made me throw up in my mouth....
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Like I said, if you don't believe in God you'll believe in anything.
Well coached I'd say, a blooming Marxist.
@Angel52 ROFL. Yeah, Angel, I can hardly function because Amanda graduated from Harvard. Just like I go on a daily admiration rant for what BC produced in AOC. Thanks for the biggest laugh of the day and that's saying something!
@RMPsumma You forgot to add that she's also a HARVARD GRADUATE!! Sorry if it breaks your heart!
@Rulya M√≥rrigan Ard Mhacha Let's try and replace opinions by actual science. Have a look at the following meta-analysis to the "Effect of Immigration on Employment". It states that "The ‚Äòconsensus estimate‚Äô of the decline in native-born employment following a 1 percent increase in the number of immigrants is a mere 0.024 percent." and "The negative employment effect is also greater in Europe than in the United States." https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4789253_The_Fallacy_of_Job_Robbing_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Estimates_of_the_Effect_of_Immigration_on_Employment
@Bitfire31337 That's actually not true. INS limits immigration to what our country can handle  accommodate. Ppl coming in illegally,  even worse Biden giving all 11 million plus more Green Cards, unbalances our economy  absolutely does take jobs from the unemployed Americans who need jobs. The US doesn't have an unlimited supply of jobs. As it is, bc of the Rona, there are even less jobs than there were a yr ago. Not only aren't there enough jobs right now for Americans already here, we certainly don't have enough for 11 million more ppl, plus more caravans Biden has invited into the US. The jobs that those over 11 million ppl qualify for are low skilled jobs which means far more competition in the job market for the poorest of our country. It's the poor who will get the most screwed over, then the middle class bc that's who's going to be paying more taxes to support all of these unemployed ppl. It's simple 3rd grade math  basic economics.
@freeclimb Thank you, exactly. These Dem politicians  leaders only use groups of ppl for votes  to divide  conquer. I come from 2 "marginalized" groups that Dems like to use for their narrative but I don't fall for it, like the gullible, easily manipulated ppl in this thread. Also, look at what most of the ppl in this thread are saying abt Amanda Gorman. They're pandering  appeasing like she just cured cancer. These ppl think virtue signaling on social media is more important than ppl's actual lives. They don't care what Fweedom Headboard Harris did to thousands of black men in California or that Joe Sniffy Biden really is obviously  blatantly racist. Virtue signaling feeds their ego  that's all that matters to them. They only think, believe, say  do what their Dem muppet masters tell them. They have no critical thinking skills or independent thought. They only know how to parrot. That must be why Denise can only repeat the same thing over  over, just like a parrot. Talk abt low IQ. I'd think she'd be embarrassed repeatedly the same lame crap 15 times but she's not. You just can't make this crap up. These Lefties are sad asf.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Well first of that's not even true. But one thing we know the religion of man (i.e. socialism/communism) certainly has. Between Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Po Pot, Castro, and others have surpassed the death toll of all previous wars combined. When you don't believe in God you'll believe in anything...
@MC Do you actually listen to yourself... It's embarrassing.
@MC moronic comment.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop No worries my friend üëçüèº
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Whatever.ü§£üòéü§£üòéü§£üòé Btw, I wouldn't think you were cute if I were paid six figures to think so.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Blah, blag, blah. üíã
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Really? From what I've read of your comments, you're not Aristotle, dyslexia or not.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop You make a derisive (I understood enough to get that much) remark to me, but I'm supposed to excuse it because you're dyslexic? Okay. That makes sense.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Lol my beef isn‚Äôt with you.
@RMPsumma Im sure someone who spends their time writing out long drawn out paragraphs on YouTube about how great they are is to be taken at their word. This young lady reached more people with this one piece than you ever will in the entirety of your life and that kills you inside. You have zero credentials. All you have to offer are your ‚Äúbelieve me‚Äù worthless assertions. You‚Äôre pathetic, plain and simple.
@Warrior Tactical extended loop Unintelligible, but I really couldn't expect more from you, now could I? You're funny, though. Thanks for that.
@freeclimb I really don‚Äôt care. Thanks for the prayers though. üòäüíñ
@Denise My perfered pronouns are he/him. But you got it.
@Juan Garcia First of all, are you actually saying addressing notables (hell, little Greta the Smug did that, even yelling to effect more worship), poise, and presence are the only requisites which make one an above average public speaker? That's asinine. Let's use someone I'm sure you hate as an example, Donald Trump. He spoke to notables, millions, in person and on TV. He was poised and had presence, but he's not even a GOOD public speaker. Believe me, I know more about public speaking than you could ever dream of knowing. Today, too many people are impressed by very little; I am not one of them. Her so called poetry aside, you won't believe this, but I could make her a MUCH better public speaker. Not that she'd allow it. She thinks she's perfect because thousands like you tell her she is. She's private school and Harvard educated. I'd think poise and presence would be reasonable expectations. Public speaking is an art, pretty much a lost art.
@freeclimb ohhh thanks girl! I love prayer! üíñüòä
@Denise Well guess it's not your fault then. I'll pray for you anyway.
Dude same. I just bought a used car from this guy, man was he good. The eye contact, hand gestures, everything. Thing broke down and caught fire already but man could he sell, I'm so glad to have met him.
@freeclimb I was born without one. üòÇ Now, go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòäüíñ
this calls "acting" just good acting.
@LH SD I gotta note, politely, that there's an inherent flaw in your way of thinking about jobs and immigration. People that come into the country do not only take someone's job away. They also live, consume, eat, drink and some even found businesses. With all that they also generate jobs. High unemployment rates are not the result of immigration, but of an overall "improvable" economy.
She make satanic ritual.
@Denise Seems your already crying. Just wondering, when did you lose your soul? Or, were you born without one?
Whatever dude. She's just a young woman reciting a poem. She has no greater insight to the inner truths of life than anyone else. The fact she is willing to be used by a rascist pig that incarcerated 100s of thousands non-violent Black men tells me she has even less insight flowery words or not.
@MC That's why I love the Biden family, they are remarkable people. God bless this beautiful young lady with a healthy life and wisdom so we can continue enjoying her messageü•∞
Would Trump or his people have had the intuition, insight, or wisdom to place such a creative talent like Amanda on the World Stage? She is a representation of President Biden‚Äôs message of unity but also capability, creativity, and truth. Our new First Lady, Dr. Biden, apparently found her and placed on the World Stage. She shined and we all shined with her. Brilliant, courageous, and powerful!
@RMPsumma ok snowflake
@RMPsumma She addressed an audience of millions who watched this televised. An audience of presidents and political leaders who were present. She did so with poise and presence. If this isn‚Äôt a showcase of her capacity as a public speaker, what is?
ü§Æ
Agreed, that was a stunning and almost perfect display of poetry. There where 2 or 3 very minor imperfections (minor misspeaks and small breaks in rhythm when swallowing), but that doesn't make it less great at all, especially considering her age and the situation. I probably wouldn't have brought even a single word over my lips.
I agree..She should make a living making speeches instead of making a living trying to run people's lives
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL!!‚ù§
She brought me into the moment. Absolutely awestruck, yes, every single thing about her is mesmerizing. She is obviously a very special human being. She is incredibly precious and I don‚Äôt even know who she is but I know what she has. A gift!
@Denise So am I, Denny baby, so am I. ü§£üòéü§£üòéü§£üòé
Shes a trained seal.
@RMPsumma Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíïüíï
@Denise Maybe you can read at an inaugural. I know then I'd be moved to tears.
So impressed by this girl. She is a gift from god
@RMPsumma Go cry somewhere else. üíñ
@Denise Original, aren't you? LOL
@RMPsumma Go cry somewhere else. üíñ
I wish the camera had pulled back and stayed only on her. I would have like to have seen all of it.
@Denise Who's crying? Just the opposite.
@RMPsumma Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíñ
"Master (Whoops! poor word choice for the "woke" crowd -- be careful üòÅ) of public speaking?" Uh, no to that.
Her words are beautiful and powerful.. however naive. This is a utopian, imaginary democracy she's speaking of. It's not real. I wish it were.
Woooow! She makes me proud to be part of black culture and hope for better world. üëç
Beautifully put!
When Americans talk about "our best" this is what will flash for me: new dawn of yellow, woven braids, bronze skin, the bright eyes of youth and poetry as a song of hope
@Encore Baby You have literally no idea of importance of literature at all. We would all be living a very crude, inhuman , materialistic life without art. There is no such thing as "human" without art. There would be no revolution without it. Have you not read one book in your life that made you think? I guess you are just jealous .
@Encore Baby let her be! Poetry is way more important then what you think for some people.
Reminds me of the speaker in the Hungergames
it was good. the hand movements distracted me. and the giant mics hid her face. she should have also had a colorful scarf.
and maybe a chained, tiger crouched at her side
Simply amazing, beautifully recited, so deep and profound! She's so gifted its mindblowing. Wow wow!!üëèüëèüëè
yes.
What an amazing young woman to deliver such a message!!!
I unfortunately missed this during the actual inauguration, but my mom was so blown away by her that I had to come look for the video. An incredible poem delivered by an incredible young woman ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Cardi B and Woah Vicki has competition! This girl is a good rapper!
absolutely great.
Thank you universe for this wonderful creation out of your finest stardust.
absolutely beautiful and inspirational
*And that's why she should be doing the next Elder Scrolls intro.*
America... America never changes.
Amazing.
Black Greatness üñ§
Absolutely stunning!!
Beautifully done
If the artist cannot find the way, the way can not be found.
She was simply awesome üëå and amazing
Amazing she is.
The last few lines are breathtaking
Brilliant!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I believe in America again
dancing lines
Huh?? That made no sense
It sounded like she started "rapping" half way through. :( .
And? It was a fantastic speech
It sounded like she started "rapping" half way through. :( .
@Kaila Hodge-McNutt Go play with your lego toys and leave the serious thinking to us adults.
So?
American resilience!
Don‚Äôt know which is more stunning, her mastery of the English language or her beauty!!
Amazing!
beautiful, there are no words. what a beautiful indigo child
That much wisdom in a 22 year old! Lord !
CRINGE
She's to young and privileged to feel REAL LIFE,the Greata Thunberg syndrome,mind you she is intelligent.
There is alway one in the crowd
Bore off
She's very calculated, from her words to her attire, she cannot be lost in that somber sea.
Her tone too. So powerful
She's amazing, although this isn't poetry (I mean anything can be poetry, but this piece feels a lot like a speech in rhymes (and rhyme doesn't neccessary mean poetry) with cliches and is very straight-forward and its function is promoting the new president and uplifting people) and I can't not to feel weird about so much uncritical joy about politics and about any kind of party/organisation in charge with gazillion of funds and power (it's somehow scary to me that these words here are supposed to represent it ... also you can't really "hate" on these words because it's common sense that democracy is good and so on)....it is a special event, but still no art for me here (I guess my expecations were wrong because everywhere it said it was poetry and I prefer different poetry).
Those who dislikes this are in denial of themselves and humanity.
That was absolutely beautiful and something for us as a nation to aspire to
This is beautiful, what an eloquent, intelligent young lady.
Perfection.
Don't lie to yourself, your country is definitely broken and it is going to take a long time to repair it. It is not only broken at the level of politics, which completely polarized your country but also in terms of the economy where instead of raising the taxes for everyone you just print more money and put yourself in a larger and larger debt. Another fact is that your politicians are extremely corrupt and you all believe that they are so good and that they care about you, no they don't, they only want to be reelected and get even more money from the huge corporations such as Facebook and Twitter and all the huge banks that hate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they loose money on it since the monetary flow is not going through their accounts.
WellDone....amen. 2021üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèI understood it tho.üôÑ
Sounds like a rap song she couldn't sell. This was also used at her high school commencement event. Can't we ever get a white guy to give these types of poems? Well this really said nothing.
ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT. SHOULDN'T BE RECOGNIZED BY ANYONE. PAY TAXES ACCORDINGLY.
Thumb-down haters why can‚Äôt you just appreciate what is great
Pretty words do not guarantee a roof over your head, money in your pocket  food in your stomach. It doesn't reduce the cost of healthcare, it can't bring back businesses lost during the pandemic, it can't even guarantee that you'll find employment within a week. Pragmatism is at an all time high because ceremonial nonsense cannot repair the growing political division  economic despair that has afflicted this nation for quite a while. Having not given a thumbs down myself, I thought I'd present that as a hypothetical argument. Take it or leave it.
So articulate and elegant. Not a single error on her speech. So special. I also love how she‚Äôs on bright yellow surrounded by dark colours, as if she‚Äôs the light on the horizon.
America's Vaclav Havel?
Amazing
This gives me major Hamilton vibes! Best part of the inauguration. History has its eyes on her ‚ù§
So corny
Word salad. Full of hateful jabs and every woke cliche imaginable. She is sewing division for future gains. Her hands make me dizzy.
WOW!!! I‚Äôm speechless!
What an amazing, talented and gracious young lady, surely the best of what America represents and can be. What an absolute privilege to hear her. üá∫üá∏
What's so very sad is given enough time, Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, right-wing media, and congressional republicans would have half the country hating this young lady if she had been elected president or vice president.
If you don't tear up when she says "Madam Vice President" you probably need to go get yourself a soul.
Absolutely incredible. She is the future‚ù§
THANK YOU AMERICANS THANK YOU AMERICA ‚ù§Ô∏è I can finally breathe again. Slept this morning until 11.30!..... So relieved! You‚Äôve had billions of us worried and under strain for four years. Your role on the world stage has always been a defender of democracy and high moral standards and that‚Äôs how we like it! WELCOME BACK ‚ù§Ô∏è K rgds A/Sweden
this self indulging spoken word BS is such a overdrawn caracter trope for so called "young black leaders" , its just here to check a box so leftist politics can check just another box (the young black sjw uneducated voters) dont believe the hype, i was unimpressed by this so called "inspiring speech"
What a beautiful eloquent young woman.How i wish i had her gift with word,s.The world is your oyster,skinny black girl.x
She's incredible. The world needs more youngsters with her wit and wisdom!!
Her hands are amazing
She went to Harvard. Free college for all
Believe it or not, the world already has a lot of incredible youngsters like her. Like Amanda, they just need a platform.
David ignore all these crackheads' replies I agree with you she was awesome
@Maeu Daou So what asian poets should i be looking for to find a similar speech at a presidents inauguration or at least something as important as this?
Soros grow in all the world satanic magicians.
tears of joy... such grace and brightness
Very beautiful
She could have written the lyrics for Tupac
Finally! A day filled with words of hope, unity and LOVE instead of violence, division and HATRED. God Bless America!
Native Americans crying in tears
This most joyous edit: and tragic moment in time encapsulated by a remarkably lucent, wise, and elucidating young woman. That was awesome
Comment section becomes transcription section
Cringe! Poetry died for a reason.
What's with the Dr. Biden nonsense?
She is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
I didn't feel anything and I'm not being rude. I'm serious, I really didn't feel anything after all that. I did not feel any kind emotion, all I heard were words.

Full transcript of Amanda Gorman's Inauguration Poem, ‚ÄòThe Hill We Climb‚Äô Mr. President, Dr. Biden, Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, Americans and the world, when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry asea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast. We‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace. In the norms and notions of what just is isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried that will forever be tied together victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to her own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare. It‚Äôs because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. This effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be a country that is bruised, but whole, benevolent, but bold, fierce, and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain, if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with. Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the West. We will rise from the wind-swept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the Lake Rim cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
Beautiful words recited beautifully!
I thought she's a rapper?

She is fabulous and a fantastic orator, but I am not sure this poem will be healing any partisan rifts.
And I'm standing here like 'she's so beautiful' *.*

I dont want to, its awful
@James Peter What did I say that was racist? The race card is so convenient when you want to avoid intelligent discussion
@Mario Gil equity is not the same as equal rights, you have no idea what you are talking about
@Beatriz i can't, but you have to try read more. Will help you
@santos portugal you can't do better than her so stfu. She was great.
@Edita ≈†evƒç√≠kov√° why? Explain your point
@James Patterson No
@De'veon Young Come at me with an argument,. I'll dumb it down for you even more than you already are.
@De'veon Young You type like an unintelligible.
@Finn Warner this is not acceptable level of poetry for an Inauguration..Poetry requires experiences and depth and insight....We had Robert Frost; we had MAYA ANGELOU(I saw that one)....Now a fresh college student reading what amounts to be slam poetry
@jeff yeah idk
@Finn Warner this is a dumb person's concept of what a smart person sounds like
@GISELLE LOPEZ GONZALEZ haha..this reflects the low level of American education.Sorry-but this meatless drivel
already doing so
@estephany campos you are better off deconstructing Brittney spears's "oops..I did it again." More meat on those 'poetry' bones
already am. üò≠
@l mbg If the true poets from last century could hear this " poem" they'd¬†turn in their graves.
@Nick Price no, because you're clearly one of those teachers that tries to shove their ideology down students' throats. A lot of people like like you even punish students who disagree with you with a lower grade.
@Nick Price so we should defer to your expertise...
@Hazel Motes and there's nothing wrong with Brittney spears she's not Mozart...Same with Gorman...poetry that low iq ppl enjoy
@Daphne van Abswoude you should replace ancient latin and greek teacher to Slam poet 59th street and broadway teacher...this has zero connection to excellence
@orionh3000 Why...what?
@jeff yeah I literally do this for a living lol.
@Mike Huntiches lol. Because I called Biden a moderate that makes me partisan AND self-righteous? Come onnn, man. You don't know me.
@Nick Price the world needs more partisan, self-righteous teachers like you
Do follow me for some poetry :)! @agratagupta
LOOOOOOOOOOL
100%
I already have üòâüíô
@Hazel Motes It sounds like you haven't talked to someone in their 20's in about 50 years. There's a huge emotional difference between about 20 (when Gorman started writing her poem) and 24, and Dylan Thomas's father was an English teacher, so he grew up surrounded by literature and poetry. If I'm honest, I prefer Gorman's poem over the Dylan Thomas example you just listed. In my limited class time, in most cases, I'd prefer to pick a poem that is intended to uplift. Furthermore, while I am aware that many poets have tenuous personal lives, unless the focus of the class was British poetry or similar, if someone said, "Hmm, would you prefer to talk about an up-and-coming feminist BIPOC poet who got into poetry to help with an auditory processing disability and whose work was given a place of prominence at a presidential inaguration or would you like to talk about the early work of a White Welsh alcoholic famous for his infidelity, who essentially left his family penniless due to his alcoholism?" it's clear whose work I'd prefer to showcase.
@Edita ≈†evƒç√≠kov√° unfortunately you are accurate in your assessment-..the 1962 inauguration poet, Robert Frost vs. 2021 inaug. poet: vacuous high school slam poet.
@yomintyfresh I don't know about that. Here's Dylan Thomas: Twenty-four years remind the tears of my eyes. (Bury the dead for fear that they walk to the grave in labour.) In the groin of the natural doorway I crouched like a tailor Sewing a shroud for a journey By the light of the meat-eating sun. Dressed to die, the sensual strut begun, With my red veins full of money, In the final direction of the elementary town I advance as long as forever is.
This is not what english majors should study. It saddens me that people are less and less receptive to the standards of literary expression. In literary studies, those standards are supposed to supersede any social discourse carried by a text, which is why to this day we still study Ezra Pound. To any english major this is mediocre slam at best, a bit of _√† la mode_ poetry with no historical significance whatsoever (I'm talking from a strictly literary point of view, not a political one).
Not jus English Lit students. A whole generation of student will study and absorb her message. That's what really count.
@oh no renlen and this is a good indicator of the inevitable decline of america...it has begun: a vacuous, marketing fluff poem that is required assignment in school....
@Hazel Motes Yes, you are missing the fact that young people often enjoy work produced by other young people and that Gorman is clearly a shooting star. (It would have been nice if Harjo had been included in the inauguration, too, though.) It's also unfair to compare the work of women who (have) had almost 70 years to perfect their craft with the work of a 21-year-old.
Read some ancient Socrates, this chick trash.
@yomintyfresh I honestly do not get how this compares to Wanda Coleman or Joy Harjo. I guess I‚Äôm missing something.
@Douglas Adams Perhaps the definition has changed. When I studied English literature in high school, it was literature ‚Äúborn‚Äù in the British isles.
we have been since it came out 2 days ago-
‚Äã@Hazel Motes You doubt that anyone will be studying this a year from now? I'm planning to include it in a class I'm teaching next year. Since you seen to be a Flannery O'Connor fan, don't forget that the "truth does not change according to [y]our ability to stomach it."
@Marko Polo it‚Äôs not a bad poem because she‚Äôs black, Adolf. But at least it‚Äôs an improvement over Traitor Tot forcing us to read from Mein Kampf.
I feel bad for them. they are gonna be stressing out over an assignment with this poem. lol
Legit, our teacher gave us an assingment due today on this
I'm literally doing an assignment on this right now-9th grade english
@Paris 54 well now, who is Shakespeare compared to the one above üòÇ
@Hazel Motes oh yes, president Kamilatoe Harris and he comrades will make it compulsory.
we‚Äôre literally gonna work on an assignment ab this today KSKQHSHQJSH
@Purplestar123 Yeah let's all be trashy racists and spit on America.
@Nick Price A puppet for oligarchs..Read classics to understand
@Hazel Motes Indeed, it‚Äôs not Maya Angelou or Robert Frost, but it was pretty nice
please, we already are
hi watching this for honors english rn
We already did bruh
@Paris 54 Just one example. Poets who read at past inaugurations included Maya Angelou and Robert Frost. Ms. Gorman isn‚Äôt at their level, either. I majored in English literature so I‚Äôm not ignorant. This is not good poetry although there‚Äôs nothing wrong if people enjoy it.
@Hazel Motes If Shakespeare was the only writer you studied in school, you had a pretty terrible education.
@Paris 54 This isn‚Äôt Shakespeare.
We did it already in üá≥üá¥
@- same
@Hazel Motes Who knows?
@Wew Lad Woops, it seems like millions of English teachers are suddenly working at Starbucks because apparently their degree qualifies them for this suddenly...
@Lindsay Huff It‚Äôs not a poem just because a few words rhyme. Poetry only differs from prose in its use of heightened language. That‚Äôs not happening here.
@Paris 54 I doubt if anyone will be studying this a year from now.
Future English Literature students get ready to make coffee for a living unless you are connected or not white.
@Hazel Motes ummmmm..... you are joking, right? it‚Äôs a poem!
My brother literally studied this yesterday.
Nah, students have been brainwashed enough. Hey Teacher Live Those Kids Alone!!!!
It's not a poem. It's an essay.
calm down, you keyboard warriors!
Im doing it rn
what??
we are already on it hahaah
@Mary Anna Jackson The study of English literature focuses mainly on analysis, debate and critical theorising about a large number of published works, be they novels, poems, plays or other literary works that are written in the English language. It isn't some celebration of Britain but of the English language, which is global.
we are discussing it right know
For all its grammatical errors and nonsensical phrases.....also, would be studied in poetry class!!!!
i hate this lady not becausew of her speech or ideals but the wave of assignments that is already headed my way because of her
@Nick Price cringe
Kind of cliche though
@Purplestar123 u were literally rascist saying social equity and equal rights which is a basic principal and calling it outrageous.
My gorge rises
Ikr i already am
@I'D JUST LIKE TO INTERJECT FOR A MOMENT Definitely, everything should be based on competence
You mean propaganda?
@Purplestar123 I'm Black and you are 100% correct. Racial equity hands people what they did not earn. That is not how to achieve racial equality, it will only perpetuate the cycle of victimhood.
Amanda is the daughter of my 6 grade english teacher lol
@Brandyn Beverly Do you want to critique what I said? Or are you just here to insult
So very true.
Nah. Study Chaucer and Shakespeare. B intelligent, not Stalinist brainwashed.
We studied it today! It is a work of art.
I am an ancient Latin and Greek teacher and I'm already planning lessons around this.
@Purplestar123 I just love when "intelligent" people think they actually are
@Truth Seeker The problem with equity is it's forcing equality of outcome, rather than fostering equality of opportunity. For one it does no good for the productivity of the economy, and it also means that access to organizations, businesses, universities etc will no longer be based purely on merit, but on the need to fill some quota based on gender, sexual orirntation, race, or whatever group is disproportionately represented compared to the country population. It is the assumption that unless every organization or position in the corporate hierarchy has a population which represents each identity group (in this case race) as directly proportionate to that of the general population, it must be racist and discriminatory, and affirmative action measures must be put in place
@Purplestar123 Okay, then what is wrong with racial equity? Surely everyone benefits from a more just, equitable situation?
@Truth Seeker I didn't say racial equality, I said racial equity. The two are completely different things
@Purplestar123 How is racial equality (I assume you meant that and not "racial equity") "the most flawed and ludicrous concept there is"? Are you suggesting there shouldn't be equality in treatment of different races? If so, you pointing out nothing you said was racist is flagrantly untrue.
Why would one study this recitation in an English literature class? English literature is the study of...literature of the British Isles, not those who speak English.
bruh my class is already doing it
@Purplestar123 Go cry somewhere else. üíñ
@Water Dubz 1) Don't pull the race card, it's overused and tiresome, there is legitimately 0 racism here. Where was I racist? 2)He really didn't "get me there" 3)You're an idiot
@Comrad Wombat You didn't say "pull yourself by the bootstraps", you said "strap your boots"
@Purplestar123 he got you there üòÖüòÇ
@Purplestar123 yeah, let‚Äôs just be racist because of pre-conceived notions. It‚Äôll Only come back to bite you in the butt ;)
@Purplestar123 so "pull yourself by the bootstraps" doesn't really make any sense does it? ‚ÄúPull yourself up by your bootstraps.‚Äù It‚Äôs a common phrase in American political discourse, particularly present in conservative rhetoric about self-reliance. The concept is simple: To pull yourself up by your bootstraps means to succeed or elevate yourself without any outside help. But when you examine this expression and its current meaning, it doesn‚Äôt seem to make much sense. To pull yourself up by your bootstraps is actually physically impossible. In fact, the original meaning of the phrase was more along the lines of ‚Äúto try to do something completely absurd.‚Äù thus this expression would make more sense if you strap (tighten your bootstraps) your boots and work hard if you want to accomplish success. Though from your comment somehow working as a barista isnt "pull yourself by the bootstraps" worthy.
@Comrad WombatWhat is "strap your boots doesn't work for a job as a barista" supposed to mean
@Purplestar123 well you can try to correct me in order to make my comment great again!
@Comrad Wombat I can tell you definitely don't study English by that incoherent sentence
@Purplestar123 strap your boots doesn't work for a job as a barista?
Not from the states but if this poem its not taught starting at least in high school would be a terrible loss. It gave me hope that things can and could be better all around. It gives hope!
@Nick Price a moderate democrat who just signed a bill for racial equity. The most flawed and ludicrous concept there is
@Purplestar123 a moderate democrat was elected! the sky is falling!
also get ready for adopting neomarxist pc agenda and working as a barista
Literally sharing it with my students now lol
my teacher is giving m extra work because the way she presented the poem reminded him of how I did mine for school....
agreed.
Webster Dictionary doesn't have a definition to define your BRILLIANCE. I can't find the words.... I'll just say THAT WAS AWESOME!
Wow, there are 20 activist or bots bickering through all this comment section to set a certain narrative. How hilarious!
I‚Äôm a 65 year young white man. I have traveled the world. This young lady is so on point and our nation needed to hear this. True inspiration will go down in history she has made her mark. I wish to thank her. üá∫üá∏üåà‚ú®üíñüí´üóΩ‚öñÔ∏è
Wow
It is people like this that make America great. Truly inspirational.
Let us Prepare because school's gonaa make us a reflection paper about this piece üñêÔ∏è
The Demon-rats CHEATED and we ALL know it.
Absolute trash. Garbage.
@John Karpierz There is a wise saying... "You can give a person knowledge, but you can't make them think. Some people want to remain ignorant, only because the truth requires change." Good luck.
@John Karpierz "Hunka crap" "Hanka virus" "snowflake" what, else?
@Hanks Yeah, well your side is full of bullies pal. So stuff it, Hanka virus. You guys deserve to be pushed around. That's all you to do to us. Not such a good feeling, is it, snowflake?
@John Karpierz The difference between me and you is that we have different views but at least I'm not a bully on the internet.
@John Karpierz People like you are the reason there's division in the US. Rather being open minded you come here to criticize. Have you ever heard of phrase? If you have nothing nice to say, don't say it.
@Anomar Namloh By the way, these minorities elected a guy that was friends with a Klansman and some segregationists. He thinks Blacks are dumb. Great job. You had one vote, and you all elected a Dixiecrat.
@Anomar Namloh You as well. You seem to be full of false narratives.
@Hanks I did do my research. The courts chose not to hear them. Hunka Crap.
@John Karpierz And guess what? All of these claims went to court and were rejected. Do your research dude. So go on... keep on believing why you believe.
@John Karpierz I I know a few people of color voted for Trump, my son and DIL did. Keep repeating false narratives.. it doesn't make it true or truthful.
@Anomar Namloh By using dominion machines, using dead people's names to vote, and having non state residents vote. There is a video of ballot stuffing. "Letting people of color vote"? Seriously, are you that stupid? Don't you think non whites voted for Trump?
How did they cheat? By allowing black, brown and Native Americans to vote? Bless you with all the blessings you surly deserve.
We just witnessed GREATNESS!üôèüëëüåÖüëã
I m not American but this made me cry
...Most of this poem was complete nonsense lmfao. So racist too. She clearly only views herself as descendant of slaves. Does she realize that just about every race has been enslaved?? Her ancestors were the main reason "THEY" were enslaved in particular, because her great great great great grandma sold her kid to slaves because she was too broke. Stop saying we need to step into the past. We need to step into the future and stop making this about identity politics, especially when Joe Biden is the most racist president in modern day history.
Beautiful. But Americans need to stop the ‚ÄòShining City on a Hill‚Äô nonsense. Democrat or Republican president - their policies towards poorer nations and those who have resources that America wants does not change! A typical super-power, not a unique one
Amazing
The Schmoyoho remix of this is going to be tight. As an occasional writer of and fan of poetry... This is awesome. Worthy of academic study. Seriously amazing structurally and emotionally. I'm very impressed.
....she makes suprematists appear neanderthals....
Absolutely breathtaking. Everything about her and her poetry. Wow. ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠üá∫üá∏‚úåüèº
Wow................
I‚Äôm Australian and I‚Äôve watched this 3 times. So beautiful.
Eloquence step aside here's Amanda Gorman
Bravo.
Both sides are as corrupt and evil as each other. The Democrats believe they are the divine light coming to cleanse and heal the US. The US, a country rotten to its core. Generations of patriotic brainwashing and 24/7 polarising biased media has created a country of gullible, narcissistic citizens. I am absolutely baffled that Democrats believe anything is going to change and that the country will miracleously mend itself, these people are figure heads. Smoke and mirrors prevails again.
Great and loaded message. Loved, Love it.
Profound.
I'm not even american and I nearly cried from how beautiful this is

Amanda Gorman‚Äôs inaugural poem ‚ÄúThe Hill We Climb‚Äù When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn‚Äôt always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time Then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade But in all the bridges we‚Äôve made That is the promise to glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it
Thank you !!!
Omg thank you for typing this, now I can take my time to memorize this beautiful amazing poem from a inspiring amazing young black beautiful and proud young woman üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ

Omg. It blow my mind.

Most beautiful moment in the ceremony. She is a great soul -- a true artist -- and a natural leader! I hope I live long enough to vote for her for president!
This is hope personified. Thank you.
I really enjoy the poem and the girl's presentationa nd lookce however, the hand gesturing seemed a bit much....too theatrical that should have remained toned down considering the event. Less is more.
i'm not an american but hell...she did made me cry a bit. That was beautiful. Funny what words can do. Trump had the "best word" according to him self but she? She was so above Trump and one of the best speaches we've heard in the last 4 years
yey....so back to more neoliberalism..... and still the USA is nowhere near being a democracy.... You see - all the oligarchy needs to get the people back in line is some total moron wannabe dictator for 4 years, and then the people forget that they actually wanted a democracy and a govt that worked for them and represented them, and is completely satisfied with more oligarchy capitalism..... USA is still the pitiful: least civilized, least developed, least educated, most unhealthy, most exploited - country in the developed world - and doesnt look like its going to gain any rankings anytime soon on those lists....oh well, at least we dont have trump, right???
What an elegant mastery of words, mesmerizing it in its tone, captivating in its fluency, breathtaking in its depth but everlasting in its influence. Words that depict the current situation and envisions a beautifully untold future. Amazing

"history has its eyes on us" the scripture quote. I smell hamilton inspiration
@Fitrikhalifa02 A founding father. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote a VERY AMAZING musical based on his life, and there are what seem to be references to the play in her poem ^^
@Fitrikhalifa02 here is the Hamilton Musical soundtrack, which has everything you need to know: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3e0JLen9XhaNicHQRYvSGNwehFRllN8T **DISCLAIMER though: it is an adaptation of history into a musical, so NOT EVVVEERRYTHING is historically accurate but it is a fun and good intro to Alexander HamiltonüòÜ It is from this musical in which the inspiration came from for some of the quotes Gorman used.
I mean who is hamilton?
@Rebecca Rahi Yes, she told Manuel and cited him on twitter.
YES I was looking for this comment. V strong Hamilton influences üòç
THANK YOU
yesss, and the fig tree part I was like hold on this is Hamilton speaking!üíñüëèüëè
It was
Far from polished far from pristine But yet able to produce gems as this there IS hope for America
Too bad corporations are psychopaths who own the government. Too bad the people, the humans cannot be inspired by her words. Too bad big business will shut down humanity, brotherhood, and kindness, in favor of profits, hate, and war.
AMEN THANK YOU JESUS FOR THIS HISTORIC TIME
People. Get off of her appearance. Listen to the message.
Beautiful poem. Well said. Amen
Magnificent

It was pretty whack tbh
She's talking about her single mother like it's somebody else's fault. And of course she had to mention slavery. Again she see herself as a Black American not as an American . What kind of unity do you expect??
Corny as heck and nothing profound about this at all lmao

"And the norms and notions of what just is Isn‚Äôt always just-ice" Genius wording this is so beautiful. Gave me goosebumps all over
@Snore Lax that‚Äôs what she said
Its just so deep! I couldn't believe it!
Am I the only one thinking of the Newsreader from the Rome TV show the way she sometimes moves her arms and delivers some sentences?
What a beautiful young woman, her poetry was honest, truthful, and deserving.
That's very powerful wisdom. Absolutely amazing lady!.üíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüë∏üíØüèÜ

More than the beautiful words of this beautiful young lady, I am impressed by the amount of ignorant facist bigots in the web still supporting the most corrupted, immoral and ignorant liar that has ever been sworn into office in the United States. Amazing. the US need healing, and needs it fast. What a great job destroying America, Mr Trump! Now your buddy Putin must be so proud! ps: I know I'm not American, and I don't even live there, but US and its people has all my sympathy and solidarity.
Never have i rolled my eyes so much
The highlight for me. Truly amazing. With the name Gorman she has got to have Irish ancestry. So along with President Biden we are claiming her as one of ours. üáÆüá™ üíö üá∫üá∏
@FlŒ±re facts are facts. üòâ
Yeahhhh we don't want her lol, stop making every american seem Irish üíö
Yeah umm no
haha wot blarney! üôÑüòâ Wakanda forever! üôÖ
If trump is watching this now,he must be very angry to see this woman reciting a poem,he was a president without wisdom,he acted on power of position not common sense that is not common
Congratulations Biden , but honestly I rather deal with the devil I know than an angel I don‚Äôt know his agenda for the United States. Well It‚Äôs a new year with bright and beautiful ideals , hope you‚Äôll got a huge list for this 2021 . Coz last year was messed up due to many weren‚Äôt wise enough to consider investment . But the question, what will you achieve this year?
@Marshal James Thanks . So much appreciated!

@Invest with' Queenie‚Ä¢ You can connect to her on what@pp
Great insight. You‚Äôre right. This is really helpful. Her success story is everywhere.
I checked on google now. She‚Äôs a registered broker / trader in United States. I need this. How can I connect with her . I hope she‚Äôll get me back
My first bitcoin investment of Dr Lydia Virginia woodruff gave me profit over 10,000 usd and ever since then she has never failed to deliver and I can even say she‚Äôs the most sincere person I have known.
@Mitchell James There are unprofessionals out there, but you can‚Äôt deny the fact there are still professionals out there for investors
@Marshal James So true. I‚Äôm retired and just started three weeks ago. I have earned $24,000 with just $9,000
People are scared of investing because of high rate of unprofessionals in the business.
She trades cryptocurrency more especially bitcoin for her clients. Making them profits and having commission for that.
Please tell me more about this , I really have to plan for myself this new year
Dr Lydia Virginia Woodruff is holding a very high prestige and reputation in personal financial management. I‚Äôm happy you mentioned her. My wife recommended her to me after investing 3 grand and she really helped us in times of this bad pandemic crisis. I‚Äôm close to my retirement and this has been and well remain a good survival for me
I almost slept at the streets last year when my rent was due üò≠ but thanks to a friend who introduced me to Dr Lydia Virginia Woodruff ,a financial adviser.
Nothing other than the gift of life. And I have consider venturing into something lucrative and profitable , last year was a lesson to everyone especially me . Well seeing 2021 is enough reason to sit down and think about your financial life .

Beautiful words. Bravo
Everyone is obsessed with the slavery that ended in the US 150 years ago, which ended because thousands of white American men fought and gave their lives to end it. They hashtag it, tweet it, share it, post it, all on the smartphones that are made by literal modern day slaves. The irony and the idiocy. Forget about fighting a bloody war to end slavery, these hypocritical virtue-signaling hive- mind degenerates won't even give up their iPhones. You people make me sick with contempt.
@WerdS I'm a woman bro
bro we are talking about the concept of "white supremacy" not white people
Did Biden run over and sniff her hair?
Africa heard you too
Very strange . Shes black sobshe suppose to love Trump . Trump gave jobs for lots of blacks .
Don't get me wrong. I'm very happy Trump has gone. But this pretentious, 'Oprah Show', saccharine, painfully worthy, sixth-former rambling is just embarrassing. If this is the keynote for the Biden presidency, then America's not out of the woods yet.
@coco d Well let's see how long it takes Biden to become as hated as Trump.
@Derek Spitz the best recommendation would be to move because what you seek will never become fruition in your lifetime or mines...or you can choose to run for a political position. Make a change yourself
@coco d "... if everyone had your stance on life, everything would be stagnant."? And what exactly is my "stance on life"? I hate Trump. I worry for America, because of destructive polarisation and a seeming inability of people to think critically and for themselves. My opinion is that a massive swing to the left now would be damaging, when what the US needs is certainty and stability, while ensuring fairness and equality of opportunity for everyone. Not this melodrama and hyperbole and inauthentic backdated blood-letting that is, in its way, as bad as Trumpism. Let me put it in terms that you might understand: Trump = bad. Woke dogma = bad. Neo-Marxism = bad. Proud boys = bad. Antifa = bad. US foreign policy =bad. Misogyny and misandry = bad. CRT = bad. US health system = bad. Us gun laws = bad. Do you see?
Everyone knows America is not out of the woods. Thanks to Trumps administration..a real setback has been implemented..but if everyone had your stance on life, everything would be stagnant. Everyone should throw their hands in the air and say forget about a brighter future because not one generation has learned from the previous before? This is life you have to live it. If you want to wallow in your dispirited disposition that is on you..I choose to forge ahead..and join the "Oprah Show" yet not being n√§ive but apprised of what is and in control of what I allow to influence me..have a good day
@Derek Spitz your original comment is perfect
@coco d Can you not read? I'm no fan of Trump. But neither am I an idiot who believes in a politically binary world, where you are either 'with us or against us'. Listen, life is much more nuanced than that and you'd do well to get your head around that. I am NOT your enemy. SMH
Now now Trump go to bed...Don't make YouTube find out you're on here...go on.. Git!!!
Amazing
Power filled words of the love of the holy, Holy Spirit delivered by a young woman who clearly see's...
Who are the miserable 3.2K who disliked this powerful, brilliantly brought message of hope, forgiveness and unity?
She‚Äôs precious and endearing, a beautiful writer AND speaker. She is lovely. Great job young lady!
to bad she said it was a domacracie instead of a republic
"But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated." Simple and yet so powerful.
@Encore Baby Example please?
So there is still hope for the Russian, Turkish, Saudi, Chinese etc people
@Snore Lax you were always the crappiest Pok√©mon anyway.
@Snore Lax projecting again? Should we talk about voter suppression at all, hmmm?
Tell that to the chinese.
In next 10 years, nothing will change for blacks in USA, remember that
Finally some truth in the comments section. They voted for this. Screw em.
Great wisdom and understanding!. She's awesome always!.üíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíéüíØüë∏

Glorified rapper
You can't find light when GODs missing. The nation is destroyed because of election fraud and turning to Communism. Wheres the constitution that these devils make an oath to protect? These swine will destroy anything decent. America is not a democracy fools. It is and always has been a constitutional republic.
3,200 down votes from despicable trumpers who "don't get it"... so sad
Gave me goosebumps. Americans and the world, when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry asea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast. We‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace. In the norms and notions of what just is isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried that will forever be tied together victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to her own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare. It‚Äôs because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. This effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be a country that is bruised, but whole, benevolent, but bold, fierce, and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain, if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with. Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the West. We will rise from the wind-swept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the Lake Rim cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
So beautiful said for all people in moving forward ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Her creativity and powerful, meaningful words are unbelievable.
"we lift our gazes to not what stands between us, but what stands before us" (Gorman). Wow powerful and truthful statement. What an inspirational writer. üíú
She was perfect at spewing mainstream media propaganda. Exactly why these corrupt establishment politicians picked her.
Wow
Simply amazing.

Simply beautiful. A message of hope and how a nation should be.
The 3.3 k ppl who disliked this need Psychiatric evaluation.
no everyone who cryed for this does
This young woman is incredible! We as a country needed to hear this at this particular time in history!!! Awesome!!!!!
‚Äã@bplincoln1982 Why? You know nothing about my classes or my learners. Seriously, I'd like to know what has triggered a feeling of pity in you. Please share with the group.
@Derek Spitz I pity your students
@Derek Spitz I totally agree with you! Just giving the young lady her props! And hoping her poem would inspire love and peace in America. God bless you!
?
@Encore Baby You are correct! I just was giving the young lady her props! Nothing will help this country but the love of Jesus Christ in people‚Äôs hearts. Until then, God bless you!
@Cheryl Williams Amanda wrote and read out a fair poem. As a college English and creative writing lecturer I see teenagers do this all time, sometime to this standard, sometimes better (often not). Some people are gushing about Amanda today for political reasons, not because of her poem. And The Bidens attitude towards here is patronising‚Äîpatting the politically expedient little black woman on the head for her performance that will hopefully ingratiate the uber-white president and his arrogant wife with black voters. Seems to be working.
She was the true star today.
Beautiful America , just beautiful !
Meh
@British Royal School he already did
Can you do it better?
Im a retired Marine and I have listened to this about 20 times now. This is what this country needs and her words is exactly how i feel and think this country should be. When you actually served and love this country it makes you feel a certain way because you know that this country can be better for all if we all step up and stop trying to devide and help build bridges üåâ
I'm a British veteran and I've watched it over 10 times. This lady has shown the world that the USA is still an example and leader to the world.
I once believed like you did. But sadly, this country will continue to care for the rich and powerful first and foremost.
Trump 2024
Thank you for your service üôèüèªüá∫üá∏!!
Why she dressed in communist China colors? Yellow ain't on our flag? Ruined a good poet
Can someone send me the lyrics???
Get this girl in front of a crowd!
She is awe inspiring!!!!!! How could 3k people give her a downvote!
Social media said this was the best thing of today, it's below average b trying to manage, never again present, always searching.
Your poetry is bad and you should feel bad
To me, this was the highlight of the inauguration. I wish I would be alive to see her one day become the POTUS in 2036. You go girl üí™üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

Amanda for next president!
WOW!!!
Look at our Daughter America, she is wondrous, courageous, and brilliant. She is the exemplar of what‚Äôs to come. God bless her and everything she represents.
To All of You Who decided to add Hate Speech on this thread or as a comment to this speech You ARE The Hill We Climb.
@Kevin Maguire I remember a time when the right accused the left to using racism like a weapon. I see that you've made peace with that. Oh, or are you accepting racism only when it's again whites (i'm not saying that Amanda was racist, I just making the assoption that's what you're sayin').
@Orionide this is why we often speak about systemic racism, but i'm sure that you are aware of this. I'm puzzled, who do you stand for ? The only politician that can fit your description is Sanders. But since he's supporting BLM and civic rights since... well, always, that can't be him. Are you talking about Trump ? If so, wow. You're so off.
More racial divide while the rich have gotten extremely rich and now work hand in hand with the government but yet they put the blame on the populace. Division benefits those big players because it removes the attention off of them. Good job idiots. Racism is only a problem when its state sponsored because a racist farmer has 0 effect over your life.
Courageous? How so? Because I've seen true courageousness.
Just another waste of life.
She should have spoke more about white Privilege and BLM
@Wnrc Ltv I guess there is not hope for everyone...
This comment made me cry. Just beautiful.
She's very good at spewing mainstream media propaganda.. I'll give her that. Great speaker.
@Still Cheeky see people like you bring negativity into our everyday lives.... How about you leave with your negativity :)
If the Democrats had her way she wouldn't be here she would have been an abortion.
Yaaaaas!!!!
Oh Yes. She gives me hope.
And that ladies and gentlemen is BLACK GIRL MAGIC!!
There were many amazing moments today, but Amanda Gorman's poem was the highlight for me! Every word, every stanza, every intonation, every rhythm, and every meaning was flawless. Absolute brilliance that made me cry tears of hope and joy!
So admit America isn't racist....she is speaking and she is black...AMERICA ISN'T RACIST.....just stop with the race baiting, you are the one destroying our country with this speech. Sorry but it's this ideology that's hurting America.
bro im not even american, but look how far america had gone, from seperating black and white, to a black girl delivering a poem in front of america and it's president. AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEE
Wait she's my age. Time to have an existential crisis I guess
Age has nothing to do with talent. You could peak at 13, you could peak at 63, you could peak at 33 or 53. Definitely only a number that ends in 3, though. : P
I would trade 1 million Trumps for just one of her. She‚Äôs the better in all of us.
@Jasper Siebelink stfu
@Fabian Ortega 12 your comment proves her words are just an eloquent version of the same orange man bad propaganda we've had to listen to the last four years.
Well obviously 1 million trumps would be a disaster
Better at what? Reading a poem?
Yeaaahhh
Democrats are evil people that let idiots who ruin our country into the U.S.
You guys are taking a poet way too seriously
@Jasper Siebelink They're not worth much.
Throw in all Republican politicians and most Democratic ones as well.
All the trumps in the mult verse
I'd trade the other 170 million Trump supporters too
Those who disliked this were watching the video while their phones were upside down.
America is a messed up country. American still celebrating their country as if the last 4 years did not happen. The last 4 years have showen what the real America is.
Nice poem given political context. But did I hear a reference to her aspiration to be president? Don't see her as a poet. The great poets or philosphers no interest in such a job and power. They focus on much bigger picture...beyond democrat and republican. They think earth and the universe and a purpose for humankind. She should consider politics as her future. And now she has fame. Lol. No artist, philospher, poet ever achieved much unless they were alone, unknown, and in pain:) Would have preferred to have seen a bright young woman or man..or old...or in between.(don't care if black, white, asian etc.)in rags come to podium and speak about the big picture issues the human race faces that supercedes all the symptoms we see playing out. But as we all know, that would never happen. We don't talk about the mega issues and focus on the symptoms, which end up dividing us.
I'm not crying damn it! That was BEAUTIFUL!!! So happy there are human beings in the White House again! üåäüåäüåä‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚úåüèºüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüåäüåäüåä

Trump has his supporters, the rest of us have Amanda Gorman.
This is the importance of education. This young Queen was discovered by Dr. Jill Biden. Im impressed by her first decision üëè üëå. Pure magic!!!
@Lunch it's called the bigotry of low expectations. It's a liberal mindset.
You're right. She was perfect pick by Jill. She spewed all the mainstream media propaganda very poetically.
Dumb hater
@Julie Kouirat Dont worry, some people just don't have the ability to see the importance and significance of certain events, such as this particular performance.
@Lunch you utter clown!! She wrote it!
dood. she just read a poem. it doesn't mean anything. even rappers write poems.
Just listening to her, you get chills, and are showered with confidence
"THIS IS THE ERA OF JUST REDEMPTION..." God please, let it be so!
@Sgt Koranflusher Uh-huh. Fraud that was so obvious that Trump couldn't manage to prove it in even one of more than 60 court cases, heard by over 90 judges, many of whom were Conservative Republicans appointed by Trump himself. The only one who tried to steal this election was Trump. Fortunately, Democracy prevailed. Sorry that you believe so many falsehoods. Must feel pretty bad.
You just had you election stolen through obvious fraud and have been told that you will be under martial law with endless lockdowns, mask mandates and forced medical procedures with untested poisons, by Biden. Your doom is coming and you will see more endless wars including wars inside the USA.
This is what a true leader looks like. Someone with passion and love for her people. Her words inspired a nation.
BARS someone edit this and put a beat to it...
This girl is going places
Graceful!
@AmandaGorman! We appreciate you! We CAN close the divide. My hope too is that love becomes our legacy. Thank you! üôèüèΩ
Go to hell if you could of heard her poem and disliked it. This is so moving.
She's a communists. And they're not about democracy or peace.
I awoke this morning feeling hopeless even though it was the Inauguration of a new administration, I was broken. With prompting of a friend to watch the inauguration and there she was with her collection of words giving the hope necessary to overcome my darkness. Her words are what our nation needed to encourage us to find solutions. I feel better.
üéäüéâüéäüéâüéäüéâüéäüéâüéäüéâüéäüéâ I couldn't help but tear up! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
Those 3k people who disliked why didn't the virus get to you first?
bc we didnt wear a mask duh
they probably just dont like biden, and it was his inauguration... regardless, the poem was beautiful.
New Age
I'm trying to find a line to quote from this to end an essay but literally, every line is quotable.
@Encore Baby in the context I think she means the monster of totalitarialism chaos violence and war that threatened to gobble up the country on 1/6 but that's just my interpretation she could just mean a very hungry caterpillar üòâ
@Encore Baby are you asking or trolling?
We braved the belly of the beast
I‚Äôll be honest I wasn‚Äôt really that impressed.:.the poem sounded like the dribbles of what she is a young 22 year old...a few lines showed brilliance, which speaks to her potential, but overall, to me at least feel short of the mark.
try your best to find a poem that is better about our country.
Lovely reading!
God knows everything.
There was more eloquence in that 5 minutes or so than every speech given the last four years by the previous administration. Technically she isn't a part of the new one but you know what I mean.
Easy as there hadn‚Äòt been any grain of eloquence in the insignificant grunt of the entire previous administration.
I predict she is about to be catapulted into a brilliant, streaking career arc over us all...and she will help turn the darkness into light... üëºüé§üí™üëç
I enjoyed and listening to her poetry. She has such resonate in her speaking voice.
Disgusting, Fraudulent Inaugeration
which one? trumps or bidens
Amazing, absolutely amazing! Her way of using the spoken word is as a balm for the soul and the message too! 3
FUTURE POTUS!
This poem is a splitting image of perfection!
Now that's the proper way to use ones hands when addressing an audience!!
She‚Äôs amazing. It would be great if a group of famous singers including Lady Gaga be able to produce a song from this poem
You have words of a Free Democrat Visionary, just as we New Democrats and Liberals in Canada would mostly sympathize to! We hope that all the wrong done, will be reversed, and Mr. Trump seeks help, becomes a changed man, does business with integrity, and respects others who are wiser than himself to much more significant levels!
Outstanding, Grace and Inspiration now mean something totally different, It means Amanda Gorman...
Are the hand gestures necessary in reciting poetry?
yes
Yes. It's the classic rhetoric style
She‚Äôs a inspiration! üò≠üôåüèª

Lowest unemployment rate, highest economic growth at least 30% compared to Obama  10%, highest stock market growth and lowest poverty rate in 2019. And everything hits rock bottom due to Kung Flu, mainstream media, BLM, Antifa and liberals. When it comes to warfare and diplomacy, USA withdrew troops from Middle East, left Iran deal and bombed that Iranian general without any collateral damage and Iran didn't do shit because they're scared of Trump and he met that fatso dictator of North Korea. It's hard to admit it but Trump might be the best president USA ever had. Good luck with your new president, I heard he's planning to legalize 11 million illegal immigrants and imagine how many real American citizens will lose the opportunities to find a job. Just hoping Biden won't die during his term, USA can't have a communist Indian woman leading a great country and plans to defund the police. üòÇ
@Ping Ng Capiz hmmm your confusing me... you said blm caused riots, but they were just mad. black people were mad because the police were killing them just because of their skin color. the white people rioted the capitol too. and im almost positive the united states isnt broken, but it is incomplete.
@oofologyy BS poetry, United Stated ain't broken? Really? Look what BLM and Antifa did to your country. Riot, lootings, etc. Only fools wil believe in BLM movement, it's a scam run by liberals and democrats.
trump tried to pardon himself, he wanted to build a wall between a country we were allies with, and so much more. i wouldn't say he is a horrifying president, but he is definitely not the greatest. nothing hit rock bottom these 4 years, but things could have been handled so much better. we lost almost 600k people due to a virus that could have been handled in 4 months, instead it has now been a year. blm is an amazing thing that did not cause anything to hit rock bottom. african american people should have rights, and i disagree with most of this comment.
this is a poetry video about our country... this is not saying trump is horrible, it is just beautiful.
Quiet isn‚Äôt always peace..
Is she signing?
Holy moley! Incredible
A poor, oppressed little girl saying a poem at the highest reception in the world. Biden leached forward at the end. I wonder did he want to go sniff her. Seriously.
?
Dr Biden hahahaha
@kozodoev ya right.... my money is on a GED for you
@kozodoev i am not as impressed with her ridiculous degree as you are. It is not that hard to get a ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù degree when your husband ‚Äúpays to play‚Äù but you continue your love fest... pretty sure you are a high school grad... right?
@oofologyy not really
@Dena Kane a professor, that is a hard job to get.
@kozodoev but yes I do have a BA
@oofologyy hahaha she is a teacher with an over rated/ useless degree.
dr biden is his wife
Amanda I don't have any another word to to tell you you are the best 22 years old I wish you the best forever God bless you my sister
Doctor biden??? Gimme a break
@chalupa lmao you stupid... you don't have to be a doctor to have the dr title...
@oofologyy correct, not a real doctor.
@chalupa a professor
@oofologyy yeah, not a doctor. Look it up.
thats his wife
Absolutely brilliant
We need a lot of women intelligent like you you are so sweetheart I wish you the best luck you should be in the Senate one day you should be a president you are so intelligent you are so brave my sister I wish we had more people like you to come through what you done today for our president and for our vice president that was awesome I loved it America changed today I'm so happy like I born again today this is how much I'm happy today refreshing New Life for me for all American God bless you my sister congratulations
Sick bars
Amazing. Got the chills listening to this
Am not American but am black... Listen BlackChild you did very well... BlackChild its possible, power to BlackChild
Loved it! Great poem, great delivery.
After that a bunch of people want to be poets.
If I was told to write a poem for trump's last day at the office. I'm rich, I'm smart. I won the election by the votes of the uneducated. I can't write, but I can tweet anytime and all the time. I will build a wall, that someone will pay for it. I love golfing and I can play it. I'm hot, I'm cold, climate change hmm can't find a rhyme word for it. my last days in office will be a disaster. If they don't reelect me , you'll see an insurrection. I'll keep quite and deny being part of it. But I will later call for the mob to be arrested. Impeached , Impeached again. I'll pardon so many. Rudy better bring the money. I left the WH humiliated. To my surprise I was deserted. I'll be back in some form. Begging for pardon from the 46th president Joe Biden.
LMAO i love this
Maya Angelou is rolling on her grave right and smiling. You were awesome

Maya Angelou would Be so Proud of this young and coming Live to You Poet! Be prepared for Amazement!! "A Nation that isn't broken, but Simply Unfinished"! Caramba!!!
The Republican party will be dead party by 2064. America is a melting pot of races, cultures and religions
Soooo you're saying that you hate white ppl and you're celebrating their demise. Got it.
Wow beautiful words in hopes of a beautiful world üíò
Dear Mr. Trump, THIS is what it looks like to know words and have the best words.
Democrats has the culture of the changing America. The Republicans hate us for that. Republicans are jealous for that. The Republican party is a dying party by 2064. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Wow!! This brought tears to my eyes. Beautiful
I'm a fifty nine year old man and this young Lady made me cry it got to me in my heart she has a new fan.Thank You So Much Amanda You Are Loved.

I'm a 55-year-old man who has cried all three times I've watched her stunning America back to consciousness.
@Alex Winterborn this the true American way. Hi from Greece
Isn't she a beautiful young lady. I love her voice and her gorgeous face
Wonderful poem! Thank you so very much Amanda!

This was so bad, it put me off watching any more of the inauguration. Seriously, was that a real poem? I‚Äôm only asking because it was bad. Like cheese bad. Horrible.
@Hikma Warrior You should have at least listened to all of Biden‚Äôs speech but to each their own.
Future President ... a poet

Like! Like! Like!
I'm sorry but what kind of pathetic losers would give this a thumbs down and why?
I‚Äôm I the only one who voted for Trump, but didn‚Äôt really care that he lost üòÇ? I‚Äôm interested to see how a Democrat White House operates.
Interesting. I think maybe you are?
Don't you love Millenials ?
If people only knew that this adminustration lives on division
Projecting again. To the privileged, equality feels like injustice.
If only you could write
That is how we begin to heal.

Out of the mouths of babes, wisdom flows...
Amazing, she gives me chills
Flawless!
As a poet from Africa Kenya this is an inspiration to many of us that yes we can and our time is at hand go!go!go! Amanda
What the hell is there to dislike about this video? Some of y‚Äôall are just randomly disagreeable for the sake of BEING disagreeable! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The dislikes are haters and can't comprehend truth. This is what happens when the uneducated don't know the words are speaking about people and America.

Yes we need to be it. Forget the dirty politicians. What is important is what is going on in my house. In my house I welcome all God fearing people. That will treat other as you wants to be treated. God bless our country.
She has a mastery of the sound of words that makes them bounce off each other like slam dancers.
It sounds exactly what I hear from the mainstream media.. I can see why the political establishment used her.
I see a lot of narcissism
@josh kirkwood Great :)üëç Thanks for clearing that up.
@TeslaStellar oh . Yes. I was being facetious. Thank you kindly for reminding me. I can never find my original comment
@josh kirkwood you said "rather suspicious wouldn't you say".
@TeslaStellar hm? What suspicious part? That was beautiful beyond words. What more needs said?
@josh kirkwood hope the suspicious part was you joking.
@TeslaStellar yes. Difficult indeed. She spoke well, for someone who supposedly had a speech impediment. Hm. Rather suspicious, wouldn't you say? Stupid fux
She spoke well. Something we have been deprived of for four years.
@TeslaStellar I had the same speech impediment until a couple months ago. Very happy for her; overcoming it in adulthood feels like such a massive weight lifted off your shoulders
Hard to believe that she had a speech impediment for many years.
This women loves Hamilton.
imagine reading this poem in 9th grade english class in 2089
A beautiful and talented girl... blinded... She will have a lot of disillusionment in her life. I pity her with all my heart. She sounds sincere. Poor little fool.
The people who disliked can't even articulate why they dislike it.
Racist
God bless her!‚ù§Ô∏è Just think, if every child going through public education was afforded equal opportunities  resources, what amazing gifts would be uncovered. Young people made whole, with sights of helping to change our world, for the betterment of all generations.

This portrait of America will never surrender to be white washed !
Very touching and burn the spirit to strive and stand up and work in unity. Beautiful poem that is full of inspiration.
"quiet isn't always peace".. Wow how true was that? All the bigots and the narcissist came out the woodwork last 4 years! They were just hiding, sitting idle when times were quieter before the man-child took over.
The gleaming input jekely divide because phone suggestively stay at a voiceless footnote. vagabond, keen slipper

just wow ‚ÄúMr. President, Dr. Biden, Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, Americans, and the world: When day comes we ask ourselves, 'Where can we find light in this never-ending shade, The loss we carry, a sea we must wade?' We've braved the belly of the beast, We've learned that quiet isn't always peace. And the norms and notions of what just is isn't always just-ice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, Somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother, can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew; that even as we hurt, we hoped; that even as we tired, we tried; that we'll forever be tied together victorious, not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that 'everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid.' If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we've made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it, because being American is more than a pride we inherit ‚Äì it's the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust for, while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked 'how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?', now we assert: 'how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?' We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our enaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy in change, our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, We will rise from the winds swept north, east where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rinsed cities of the midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it." (*just slight editing from a previous kind poster that originally transcribed this)
This may sound crazy, but after seeing how STUNNED even famous men were, for the first time, I saw how profound the link is between words and leadership.
Without a doubt, this profound link between word and leadership should be etched on every would be leaders mind
bro what üíÄ
We seek harm to none and harmony for all... mmm
She must get awesome grades in English ü§£
Man she was spittin. God bless her, and the United Shaytes. Who remember when Trump said Shaytes instead of StatesüòÜ

Incredible. This will go down in history as one the most captivating speeches. I'm not American but this even gave me such hope and drive to do good for ourselves and the generations to come.

Amazingly beautiful and soooooo inspiring!! WOW
She did amazing I was just captivated üíì
Her highlighter is so sparkly, her hair is laid.
@Christina Vaccaro...Most cattle herders aren't educated. It's no wonder you can't process her eloquent words! Signed: Indigenous......
@Creole Belle ugh.
Yeah her hair‚Äôs dope
@Christina Vaccaro So bitter, so ugly. All the black women there stunned and you can stew in the anger for rest of your numbered days.
I loveeee that added red band. Its so good.
@Honest Radical she's BORING ! SLAVERY AND HER SINGLE MOM...OH BOO HOO
@Honest Radical she's not amazing.
@Germangirl don't vote YUP !
@Honest Radical Omg. You're as ridiculous as this " poet". Here today , gone tomorrow.....slavery  a single mom. Whoop whoop. Who cares ?
@Germangirl don't vote yea and oh how impressive is her jewelry from OPRAH?? OMG OMG OMG !!!!!!üëéüí©
Amanda Gorman is a racist !
Joe Biden is making it worse the US is divided
@R≈åNIN a pineapple with a red frisbee in her head ; with the same old lament.....slavery ....single parent....join the club. Nothing to get excited about here. Same old same old....phony ass clowns... In clown colours too !
looks like a pineapple
@Germangirl don't vote that's amazing. NOT. Boring and not readily understandable.
@Germangirl don't vote she is less than amazing. I'm so not impressed . Some black girl gimme a speech that doesn't include slavery....maybe I'll be impressed then. 0.00
@Luna Stark frisbee head
Laid with a red frisbee in it. How festive
@Luna Stark It's really childish you came under my comment. If you don't have something nice to say you don't have to say it all. You're truly being a hater right now; a person who feels the need to be negative for no reason. It was an unnecessary comment. Just stop hating please.

@K MT¬† .I can say what I want as long as I'm not insulting anybody if you don't like it you can go somewhere else . Have you ever heard of something called freedom of speech? looks like you are one of those corrupt governor's children or payed handyman wanting to keep your wealth that's what it sounds like to me. Such a statement can only come from a person whose mind is filled with greed and carelessness. I'm glad everybody can read what you wrote this is what we have living in this country America read carefully what this man wrote! This is what a traitor looks like
@Honest Radical I agree many people have become so shallow and empty and cruel...and they say whatever horrible thing they want...but offer no concrete alternatives or solutions...just more hate that they spew .
@Denise she /he writes the same comment everywhere I don't even think it's a see it's just a profile picture so probably paid not sure.
@Denise obviously you are not enjoying yourself if you been writing the same comment in so many other comments section to everyone else .if you want to enjoy yourself then why don't you surround yourself with people that agree with you.üòè
@K MT .I can say what I want as long as I'm not insulting anybody if you don't like it you can go somewhere else .

@Germangirl don't vote Wrong platform. We don't care about your rant and your conspiracies.
@Luna Stark What you really mean is that she was and is so stellar that there was nothing you could pick on. However, you decided to go for her hair even thought there is nothing wrong with it but in your head it is a way to put her down. Why? Let me guess... that's not your hair type. In conclusion, this young lady is above and beyond anything you could possibly imagine being. She conquered a speech impediment recently, has 3 books coming out, just wrote and recited this amazing poem at the presidential inauguration, the entire planet woke up praising her and is going to run for president when she is old enough to qualify. What have you done lately?
@Luna Stark just trivial appearances. Pay attention to the words and meaning of a wonderful poem.
@Germangirl don't vote Why don't you try to do something positive. Can you do any better? (Donald Trump lied about everything). If you want to be mad, be mad at him....smh
@Luna Stark *you‚Äôre. Now go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòâüíñ

@Luna Stark Go cry somewhere else, Luna. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üíñ
@Luna Stark jealous
@Germangirl don't vote Again, you are stuck in the superficial nonsense of the culture that is detrimental to any group of people. Many of the most accomplished people went to the same school as everyone else. Who cares about who picked her clothes or did her make up. Who cares!!! Why is such a shallow way of looking at life matters to you. I guarantee if you practice for 10 years, you will not be able to compose such profound message of love and unity, yet not deviated from realities, and full of pragmatic guidance to achieve excellence and healing. THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FOCUS. Get off watching Springer show and get some education. That's for your own good.
@Germangirl don't vote Sorry if my comment insulted you. We could all use a little help, I'm getting mine. I just hope you get yours. I know the pandemics real because I know people who got the disease and died. I had it myself. If you don't believe well-documented evidence from medical professionals and scientific journals, go to your local hospital and get the stats from them.
@Luna Stark she does she keeps saying she's enjoying herself so how she surround yourself with people that go against her if she constantly have to tell everybody that she would enjoy herself
@bookoobeans well that's strange my best friend is a social worker and she agrees with me 100% . So maybe you need to go to seek help for yourself .üòè. Obviously you need it because all you gave was insults and you didn't put a single fact on the table. Don't you think of this as a very controlling( out of fear and paranoia) Behavior(or trying to be? ü§£). So please next time you respond put facts on the table especially when it comes to my claim that we are not in a pandemic.I hope I am talking to an adult.
@Honest Radical how is she amazing when she went to school like everybody else. practicing for a speech for months and somebody picking out her clothing and do her hair?ü§£üòÇ. You're right that's amazing
@Germangirl don't vote Suggest you contact a social worker and get some mental health counseling, engage with the world again, even though it isn't perfect.
@Denise you spam this on every comment, you'r cringe ..... get a life
@Denise ü§≠ü§£U not enjoying yourself if you have a hundred people in other comment sections that going against you give it to you you put on quite a bit of effort though. ü§£
@Luna Stark Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòäüíï
@Germangirl don't vote go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòäüíï
It sickens me that this amazing lady is giving us the most powerful message during the most vulnerable times and you superficial morons are talking about her appearance!!?? Just STFU and listen to the message, you may leave the streets culture and become a contributing member of the society.
@Luna Stark she wears her hair 100 different ways. Maybe you can call her for something that is more your fancy. Jesus christ it's so hard for some people to just give a little encouragement.
her hair looks crappy tho ....
Disgusting display of a parade.Instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the American people making everything seem glamorous while this Rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you . The Covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream. Enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red Hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way .ENJOY YOUR GLAMOROUS SHOW AMERICA
@MDA M. you got pretty and petite in the 60süòÄ
@jelly bob she's so pretty and petite.
The poem was mesmerising but damn I like her hair Smh
Great to see young artists get a platform.
It's great, but unfortunately her beautiful poem is forgetting that nothing will change until we admit we always have a SIN and MORALITY problem in this world....not until we admit without Jesus, nothing changes.
Beautiful. I can‚Äôt help but think her hands must have been freezing!
Breathing Taking ‚ù§Ô∏è
She will be president in the next 20 to 25 years from now, such a beautiful mind and soul
We can only be light in Christ - I hoped to have heard that only...
@Suzette van der Merwe I get that. But most people don't understand that. One day, perhaps a special soul will be bold enough to SPECIFICALLY lift up Christ.
Beautiful and magical
Because it's your time powerful and peaceful with purpose .You knocked it out of orbit.Thank you..
This young lady deserves respect. She's very well spoken. It almost felt like I was listening to Maya Angelou. She has a bright future. We are all one race. God made us in his likeness. We are all his children. Thank you Ms Gorman!

She's such a doll. Lovely young lady for damn sure.

A Hymn To Hypocrisy
"To envision that everyone should sit under their vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid" wow! well said.
Can you please explain the meaning of that line. Looks like from Bible to me. Thanks.
@Ihuoma Joshua That's from Micah 4:4.
Ritual poem for the evil ones.
Um what?
People like her deserve to be in power, not some privileged person who bought and paid his /her University degree and shoved down our throats into the political scene a Congress number or a senator or a judge that rule the country generation after generation it's time for the real thinker to be the decision-maker not the children of the elite few.
Wow, Amazing Amanda!! Powerful poem!!!
Wow this lady is amazing!
This is such a joke.
Poem, not joke. Similar to your eyes maybe, but indeed two different things.
I'm not American but I wouldn't have missed this for anything. What a queen!! üëè
@Uniquely Tia Lmao. We just talked about her in class then did a graphic organizer about what was the purpose and subject of the poem and stuff like that if they gave me a speech to do I wouldn‚Äôt do it lmao üò≠üò≠
@Dylan we had to write a whole speech-
@Uniquely Tia Never mind we just watched it Friday at school and we have to do a graphic organizer on her poem
@Dylan oop- Well, I go to school in the U.S. but I‚Äôm Indian. Maybe it depends on the grade-? Or the teacher? My teacher is pretty strict lol.
@Uniquely Tia I‚Äôm American and we didn‚Äôt even have to watch this for school
@Uniquely Tia By far the best part! Her words restored my hope.
Im American and im glad other parts of the world are able to see this gold. Although running away isn't best answer, I've contemplated moving to a different country. It's the bright, Inspiring, and intelligent people like this that give me hope and continue to fight for equality and what is right.
I'm filipino and this was touching
@Uniquely Tia She was amazing to watch
I'm Indian. I had to watch this for school, and this was the best part of the inauguration.
Likewise I'm Irish and I was very happy to witness greatness
Beautiful
They pulled every propaganda scheme available almost made it look like an app to school special
PRESERVE OUR HERITAGE!!
Congratulations üëè
Astounding.

Shes literally shining in that sun.
@Louise E So you're saying I'm jealous that Amanda is pretty, smart and (moderately) successful as a poet? Firstly, I'm not a woman, so why would I be jealous of her looks (if anything I find her quite attractive). Secondly, I like smart people (which I doubt you are). Thirdly, I'm successful in my field (I have absolutely no desire to be a poet). If my disagreeing with you has triggered you, my apologies. But do you really expect everyone to agree with you all the time? Yes, you probably do. SMH That's one of the tenets of woke puritanism.
@Derek Spitz Because she's beautiful, intelligent and successful. If you weren't you wouldn't have gone out of your way to argue with people who are complimenting her.
@Louise E Of what exactly?
@Derek Spitz You're jealous. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@Daniel Curry You do know the BLM is a front for neo-Marxists who in reality don't give a hoot about 'black lives'? What I suggest you do for a happier and more productive life is to stop seeing the world through the prism of 'race' and stop pinning your personal identity on the colour of your skin. Guess what? Life's a bit*ch for most people, regardless of the colour of their skin.

It's called Melanin Activation. The Sunüåû is her best friend
Yes. Sweaty.
Who TF disliked this?? ü§Ø
May God continue to bless you with flowing words of love, truth and strengthüôè
Today is a Great day for the World and America. We often forget one of the greatest human experiments that America conducted has change the World we are in now. It was America who led the World into the Modern multi-racial multi-cultural World Order. In fact where we live at the present is the New World Order. To be able to worship,love,express,freely no matter what race or gender you are. This has not been so for the past thousands of years we often seem to forget that. A great time to be alive indeed! God Bless America!
Why so many dislikes. For what reason?
Platitudes. Democrats use race to divide and distract while they do horrific things with our money and our constitutional rights. The race thing is tired. Civil War ended 150 years ago. Nobody is holding anybody back, quite the opposite actually, see affirmative action. This is just saccharine propoganda.
Blatant, unapologetic racism. There's no other reason or excuse for it at this point. This girl gave them nothing to use as an excuse. The problem is, I think most of them don't care if they're outed as racists at this point.
Now imagine that this was recited in front of million of audience at the National Mall.
Instead she recited it in front of practically nobody because half the country are prepping for civil war.
This young lady brought me to tears. Will watch again and again.
I am going to go out on a limb here to say that the 2.9k, so far, that disliked this are either racists, or butthurt Trump supporters, or just very uneducated Americans that could not keep up with this young lady's incredible intelligence, her articulate use of words, and the cadence in which she presented her poem. She, by far, stole the show and will forever be remembered in this moment and I wish her much more great success in her life. (edit: now up to 6.5k.. wow I am so ashamed how petty my fellow Americans can be.)

I don't know about you, but for me she is the highlight of the whole event.
@ploppolp you misunderstood my answer or I did not say it right. It was all about her composition and words. But I did think she was an exceptionally brave young lady also. Sorry plopplop. üëç‚úå
@Tina King so nothing to do with the words in her composition... interesting
@ploppolp she was speaking to the most powerful men and women in the US.
@ploppolp her voice and the way she spoke. Can you imagine how intimidating that would have been for such a young 22 year old. young woman
@John o Shea she seemed to be eaten up with jealousy. The same type that stormed the Capitol and killed people, only because their leader told them a bunch of lies and they swallowed the kool-aide. Embarrassing. The saddest thing about it is, Trump wouldn‚Äôt give two cents for them. You just can‚Äôt talk to irrational people.
@Mario you are the most negative person in all of these comments. I just don't think that somebody tripping and almost falling is funny . But, yes in fact I do have a boring life. Does that make you feel better
@Mario I absolutely do. I did not mean to give you a thumbs down. I was trying to comment and I hit that. Sorry. But I am 65 and my life is boring. Does that make you feel better
@Christina Vaccaro Your believe is different to me. So look with the greatest respect I wish you all best in your life and I'll respect your beliefs
@Mr. Meerkat - Biden's speech was Biden BS - there's nothing to it but pandering and he has zero sincerity.
@Christina Vaccaro - Yeah, Pelosi can't talk without her hands flailing. It's symptomatic of liberals.
üëáüëâüëàüëê‚úãborn to hand jive baby !üéµüé∂üéµüéºüéµüé∂
@John o Shea talent ? Ok.
@John o Shea - As a Biden supporter - you're the one that's bought into the endless stream of left wing lies that Biden and Harris and all the globalist libturds have been spewing for decades
100%
@Christina Vaccaro Ok you believe lies over truth
@John o Shea Trump was the real deal....biden/harris are senile ass clowns that can't string 2 sentences together ! WAKE UP AMERICA !!!
@Christina Vaccaro Why are you jealous of a talented woman
@John o Shea I'll never vote again. 74 million people voted for Trump....INVESTIGATE! Biden/ Harris = ass clowns
@S955US84 AGREED !!!
@S955US84 she's a joke...but let's all stand for the girl spouting about slavery with Oprah's jewels on her ! Yay Amanda Gorman.....our hero?
@Mr. Meerkat all a bunch of phoney Ass Clowns ! Good luck America ! This guy won't make it the next 4 year's....can u say senility ?
@John o Shea how could u understand a word with all her ‚úãüëêüëáüëâüëáüëÜ‚úä
@Mr. Meerkat yawn
@George Washingpun her poem made no sense üëÜ‚úãüëê‚úã‚úä but she was born to hand jive baby!
Nope
@Georgia Madison - So if a young asian male had written and read the same poem, it would not have meant as much to you. Nothing racist about that. Not much.
@Tina King me too! such wisdom! Sage! What‚Äôs your biggest takeaway?
Very much so, it was pleasant to see strong independent women of color give a moving speech to the whole nation. I'm very proud, I hope to see this a lot more.
Ema Nava - the poet is the highlight of the inauguration for you? Now that's just really sad
yes 100% yes üëèüëè
@Mr. Meerkat Cheers bro. I know I'm only looking from a far. But iv friends in Chicago saying there struggling to find work so I understand you mate
@John o Shea If only that were true, here in the states its hard not to be a cynic. I respect what you're saying brother. Slainte
@Mr. Meerkat I'm from Ireland I'm just hoping United states can rest and not turn to violence your vote is a weapon and vote for change
@John o Shea Hmmm, to me it seemed to be pandering to a certain group of people which is in no way inclusive. I thought Biden's speech about unity was the takeaway here. But you do you big guy.
I'm from Ireland and I was blown away. Biden was great with his speech. But her words were the ones people should listen to if they want to have a future without hate
What a boring life you must have.
@Mario Glory Why is that funny?!!!
About the only thing good.
I agree!
She was! And I was so captivated by her wisdom.
@Sandrina Totally!
i agree
Fantastic. A testament to what private school and Harvard can blossom, and a reminder that everyone should have quality education, not just those who can afford it.
La SUPER amo!!!!!
she is our new syrup girl .. :)
Sounds good. Too bad it's so naive and backwards.
Wow! What a beautiful young woman with such a deep, wise soul and mind to say such power truths in such a loving and wise way. Thank you for this poem. I wish you the greatest success with these words that you have spoken, and for our country.
I cry watching this.
BEAUTIFUL complexion, well poised, and lovely poem. üòä
Wisdom in words because we allowed our ears to listen, a lost art in almost everyone because we're too busy with things that really aren't productive, this beautiful young woman touched my soul.
So beautiful from a well spoken young lady! Whoever disliked this, you're a racist for not respecting Black positive talent.
Headboard Harris
genius. artistry personified

Wow, the poem and the delivery are both stunning! Thank you for this beautiful poem!
we will never again sow division...thank you
"And change our children's birthright." That's a world I would like to live in.
@Christina Vaccaro She will never . You Can Tell She's from a wealthy background I don't care what lies they tell you. A blind man can see through that
Ok ! African Queen ! for 1 day
One thing is certain....Oprahs jewels u can hock and make some loot $$$$!!
We were victorious ....with President Trump ! He loved u too little black girl. Sorry u were so closed minded that u couldn't see. Good luck with The Ass Clown Administration. Now ? Be terrified Honey. Now you'll see ? CATASTROPHE!!!!

Loved the " air quotes ".
@Wayne Daugh point taken. I actually said to someone I'm not a big lockdown believer. But when they started talking about covid wasn't real i just quit responding. If everyone listened to science instead of trump we may have nipped this in the bud. Did Biden do everything right 40 years ago, hell no. Long story short trump has become way to unhinged by the end.he had to go. The insanity of the election nonsense was disgusting. Your points are well taken tho. I'm personally glad he's gone. The video was intended to be about the poet anyway. Not really sure how it got so off track.
@Germangirl don't vote yea. Does this chick fight for t.p.???
Love the ketchup / mustard look and oooo ! The jewels from OPRAH !!!!!
@Mark Haunert Lmfao. Trump closed us off to China right away. And guess what they called Trump? Xenophobic and racist for doing it. The guy literally could not win... He's damned if he does, and damned if he didn't. Oh, Trump didnt act soon enough. Oh Trumps xenophobic and racist for closing us off to China when supposed Covid19 hit the world. Which one is it? Did Trump not act soon enough? Or was Trump xenophobic and racist for closing us off to China. Hypocrites
@Mark Haunert Well, let's think about it.... The government and health officials only solution is wash your hands, wear a masks, and stay 6ft away from others. Meanwhile small business owners forced to shutt down, close there buisness and big corporations remained open. Wtf does that tell you... I know people that lost there entire buisness do to unnecessary forced lockdowns. Yet big corporations remained open? Wtf? Yeah, we are mad as hell. And any true American should be. Wake up. And you're beloved Biden. Let's refresh your memory on what he stands for... Maybe, you are too young to remember but I remember it all too well.... People have forgotten that Biden was for school segregation back in the 1970's. Wealthy rich white Male didn't want his kids going to school with black kids. Biden also passed the 1990' crime bill that resulted in mass incarceration of petty crimes that destroyed the black communities. The same guy that called well known KKK clan members friends.... How quickly America has forgotten. But hey you ain't Black unless you voted for Biden. What a hypocrite....
@Mark Haunert from Demokkkrats.
@shkspr 78 from her poetry????
Your child‚Äôs birthright has changed and not for the better.
@Mark Haunert Try again
@Mark Haunert and just to wrap it up.Tge lawsuit is in against WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Something they would not tell your mainstream media I sent the link earlier. No pandemic.
@Germangirl don't vote " rub brain cells together " .I'm done be safe‚úå
@Mark Haunert this is the outcome of your behavior this is the people that you supporting for virus so deadly that you have to test for it to know that you have it. Do you even know what you doing do you even know who you are supporting with your statements . So are you telling me you agreeing with women and children being beat down? https://youtu.be/yKA1x4j5IkQ
@Mark Haunert first of all the long-term effects on people constantly wearing masks remain to be seen. Second of all since there is no deadly virus there is no reason to wear a mask in the first place again you won't look at my information if you can rub to Brain cells together then that's not my problem go where your mask and make sure you get your vaccine.Im not. Curious what makes you think that we are independent where do you get your information from. Amuse me
@Germangirl don't vote also i never said I was a big shutdown fan but people should act like an adult a just wear the mask instead of crying like a child
@Germangirl don't vote yeah well not voting make room for a bad situation. I'm not usually political but this creep had to go. Like I said we're not going to change each other's minds so what's the point. I don't listen to just 1 or 2 information sites either. I do think it's ironic that I'm the fool for listening to legitimate doctors. Trump himself got caught in a tape saying how bad it could be , then came out and tried to blow it off all out of selfishness.
this videos of each combined approximately 3 minutes long but I guess your country is not worth it.So sad Disgusting
@Mark Haunert this is what a traitor Americans. It looks like everybody can see what you doing here you are not willing to listen to what somebody else has to say but continuously make comments and want everybody to listen to you I'm telling you this virus has scientifically been proven not to exist your behavior is absolutely cowardly trying to run your mouth but don't want to hear nothing from anybody else at all cost. Because of people like you using mainstream media as a source of information believing that we are independent we are in this mess and no I do not vote not even for Trump all of corrupt. Wow shame on you
@Germangirl don't vote I'm not reading all this just so you can tell me there's no covid sweeping the globe. Yeah it's a world wide scam. You won't change my mind and i won't change yours. I don't need to prove anything but the burden of proof is on you to prove it's a sham. If trump would have shut his mouth in the beginning maybe it would have been contained enough so there wouldn't be a need for shutdowns. The blood is on trump
@Mark Haunert proove me wrong I don't get my information from mainstream media I do my research prove me wrong.2)it's a shame how many people like you blindly trusting virologist microbiologist epidemiologist funded by Elite parties such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation so sad what has America come to. Because of people like you following orders without questioning true¬† science small business owners lost their businesses(while Walmart remains open üôÑ ü§£).And¬† People lost their lives being afraid to go to the hospital. Men sitting¬† at home depressed not knowing how to feed their¬† family at the same time alcohol was made in essential item for them then in their drunken mind to¬†beat their woman and¬† pedophile their children .¬†YES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PEDOPHILIA INCREASED DRASTICALLY DURING SHUT DOWN !Not knowing what those men were doing later ¬†commit suicide. So sad whether you know it or not you got a lot of blood on your hands out of ignorance
@Germangirl don't vote covid lie??? Really.
I'm sorry but these people are sick I agree with you.
@Mark Haunert Instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the American people making everything seem glamorous while this Rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you . The Covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream. Enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red Hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way .ENJOY YOUR GLAMOROUS SHOW AMERICAü§£
You're the one with the irrelevant comment. I'm all over the place complimenting the young lady. Take you nonsense somewhere else.
Keep sharing the truth do not let anybody discourage you we are in a battle. People will always curse you out that's okay do not let them stop you. I think your comment make more sense in here than anybody else's. These politicians trying to make look everything So Glamorous while the rich get richer(such as Bill Gates ) and we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper
@Mark Haunert you bot go away I enjoyed her, more than everybody else's
@Valentino Luketic ok bot. Go away and let people have a good day. üòÄ

Incredible
Such insight and wisdom at 22! Incredible. Don't understand how a single person can dislike this, let alone 2.7K. People who are disliking it, try to get an education and some humanity while you are at it.
@Sgt Koranflusher For a brief moment there I was interested in what you had to say, until you became disrespectful to the Vice President of these United States. I‚Äôm out.
@DaOakMan Having 'served' unfortunately does not enlighten one to what is going on in the world. The fact that you bring up 'conservative' tells me that you still live in the box. I only lean conservative because "liberal" left me and went insane and marxist, which is 'internationalist'. True liberalism was embodied by Jefferson, who espoused that we all remain armed civilians. while this is something Biden/Kameltoe are already trying to undermine. Importantly, BOTH conservatives and liberals today are neither what they claim to be. You speak of the income tax code. But ignore that fact that income tax itself is anathema to a true constitutional conservative. While on the other hand it was Karl Marx who espoused that income tax should be imposed upon the masses and further that it should be gradient and biased toward the rich. ..in order to control the masses. Income tax was forced upon all Americans by the true masters of this world, bloodlines who today control and possess trillions of dollars not just billions. Who control all world finances not just American, who own ALL major media outlets and virtually write foreign policy and some domestic. Who elect presidents and who have killed presidents. They are our real enemy, not each other ... and certainly not Putin, Assad or Iran.
@j p Thank you for providing further proof of my point.
@Sgt Koranflusher so, sarge, don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre still on active duty, I‚Äôm a proud US Navy veteran. Looking forward is not bad for the country, neither is looking outward. Yes, I know some of you would like to return to day‚Äôs yore, but we‚Äôre not going backwards. So either you come along for the ride or feel free to hop off anytime. Don‚Äôt start with the farce of ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù you cats support a common thief. Who wrote a tax code that benefits the wealthy and penalized the working class. If you‚Äôre not a billionaire, you support for the worst president ever is against your best interest.
@DaOakMan Those are the "ones" you and she, are supporting and speaking for.
I'm disappointed with these comments that call people who didn't care for this poem fools, illiterate or that they must be from red states. I didn't care for the poem. I supported Biden/Harris though I would have preferred Harris as our president instead of Biden. I'm not illiterate. I'm well educated. I own more than one book of poetry. I just didn't care for this poem. One of the biggest problems we have in this country is that people automatically think they can villify anyone who disagrees with them, even when it's as simple as someone's preferences on poetry.
Probably the ones who are guilty of wanting to "Destroy The Country, Rather Than Share It".
All the dislikes are from red states like Kentucky and it‚Äôs because they are illiterate and can‚Äôt comprehend what was said.
@Denise So am I, Miss Bimbo!
@Sgt Koranflusher go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
Have pity on the fools
It‚Äôs cause they‚Äôre too illiterate to understand it
Oh thanks for reminding me....I haven't clicked on "dislike" yet.
Well delivered. Amazing girl, she is one of the true American.
This is the America I want to be in..
@Brittany Johnson you'll be jobless and homeless soon then give me your speech about green new deal
@Brittany Johnson antifa blm led the people into the capital lol.
@Brittany Johnson u obviously have zero clue what the green new deal is. You drank the cool aid.
@goggle boy no the green new deal will not collapse the economy actually it will address climate change in this country that we desperately need to deal with. It will put us on a path of more good paying jobs. It‚Äôs crazy saying this Antifa bs the people storming the Capital with pipe bombs is crazy the group of extremist who tried to kidnap a governor is insane and if you think Portland is more insane than trying to kidnap a governor and threatened to hang the VP cuz of an election u must haven‚Äôt been paying any attention for the past few weeks and idk what to tell u
@Brittany Johnson insane is the green new deal. Going collapse the entire economy. That's insane. Insane is antifa organized by dems just burnt down dnc in Portland lol now that's insane
@goggle boy I‚Äî ur comment is insane go get help plz
‚Äã@goggle boy Scared sad little impotent boy. Go home and let the grown-ups speak.
@goggle boy üòë stfu
Amen this country needs to heal from what's been happening for the past few years and heal foreign relationships
You want this country to heal then people better quit race baiting and dividing. Civil War ended 150 years ago. The only slaves are the ones who made your smartphone that you use to complain about slavery.
When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn't always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge¬†a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we'll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we're to live up to our own time Then victory won't lie in the blade But in all the bridges we've made That is the promise to glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it If only we're brave enough to be it

@Steve Sand ü§£ ü§£ he has changed? 40 yrs in politics and has done nothing but he's changed now. ü§£ ü§£ goodbye
@Steve Sand ok then let White people be proud of being White!
@Big E because people change and he has spend the last decade working with and helping African Americans.... I agree the crime Bill hurt minorities and he was against bussing in the 70s..... difference is he changed and supports policies that benefit minorities now, and Trump Doesn‚Äôt. he wants t lo raise minimum wage , trump doesn‚Äôt. He has hired tons of minorities it huge positions, trump didn‚Äôt. He ended the Muslim ban, he ended construction on the wall, he helped write the violence Against women act, he ended the ban on trans people in the military, he is trying to secure a road to amnesty for immigrants , he is trying to pass an economic stimulus for the pandemic which is hurting minorities the most. He did a moratorium on evictions which‚Äôs helps many minorities.... I‚Äôm Not saying he is perfect, certainly the policies that he currently is in favor of are pro-minority. He trying to end the Trump tax cuts that only helped super rich white bollionaires
@Big E üòÇüòÇüòÇThat was rich
@Elysee Blackstone of course you don't, the irony is people of color voting for a man who despises them.
@Big E Yet you voted for Chump. I dont have time to tell you the most ridiculous irony of your thought process.
@dsd Dala this is true!
. Sorry I forgot you black people can talk about the Latinos and the white and the Chinese but we can't say nothing about you African-American because y'all think you are. the only ones that have suffered sorry! realization of unity for. Unity realization
@Steve Sand senator Byrd was his mentor and head of kkk chapter, biden and Hillary did his eulogy. Not to mention kamala called him out on his racism during primary, he also said he didn't want to " junglelize his kids with blacks in school, you can't own a 7/11 unless you're indian. You can Google this its not hidden information. I'm Hispanic and would not support him that's why I wonder why other minorities would. He also was the sponsor for the 90s crime bill we all know how that turned out.
@Big E please link your source showing Biden being a KKK supporter....because it is not ‚Äúwell known‚Äù because he has elevated mostly women of color to positions in his cabinet including his VP...... also even if he was racist, America has proven that they will elect a VERY well known racist to the White House, trump. You know how you can tell who is more racist? The fact that old white men voted for Trump the most and people of color voted for Biden the most. That makes Him bad at being a racist if he can‚Äôt get the racist people to vote for him
I don't understand how this young lady is speaking for Biden ,who is a well known racist and supporter of kkk members. Can someone explain to me why his bigotry is accepted?
@GetIt GoingOn Elon Musk didn‚Äôt have to fight a 2 front war of not being considered a person because of his skin color AND his gender..... people can be proud of what their ancestors achieved in order to gain equality, but being proud that your ancestors were the oppressors and other people had to catch up to you is stupid....
@Steve Sand you are too
Me too! And I‚Äôm a White guy
@Facts Over Feelings Here's a fact for you: The Constitution was written for Rich White men. When they said "we," they sure as F*** did not mean, Black people, Native American people, women of any race including White, poorly educated White men, nor any others....nope. But you have gotten a pass over the years, because every damn thing in media, public policy and social rewards saw anyone who was a White male as deserving, to the detriment of all others. No one wants you to be unproud to be American, but today, as in every single inauguration, there has been a White man or a 1/2 White man at the center of that ceremony and we know, it's just yet another day, as in all the other previous days, for White men everywhere to reaffirm they have more privilege. You did not need to say it allowed. We know, we know. Facts are a great thing, right...not your feelings about privilege.
Period black woman to me it‚Äôs the strongest and powerful woman in the world
@GetIt GoingOn people would not have to make statements like Mrs. KeeShia2you's, if they had been respected and given equal opportunities since the founding of this country. It's fairly obvious you are not actually a "World Traveler" and I speculate you haven't been far from home ever. Because people who do actually travel far and wide, understand that not everyone has the same opportunities and privileges they have been given.
I'm sooo happy to hear this!!üôèüò≠
The white privilege has no idea. They are always the first to start complaining about what we say. I felt the same way. Amanda made us (Black America) Proud.
@Mekeala Watkins Thank you, Queen
Tow
I'm not
@GetIt GoingOn I care if I‚Äôm black, I care if she‚Äôs black. I‚Äôm black before American, at least that‚Äôs what has been forced on us for centuries....so hush, and let her have pride.
@Facts Over Feelings ok do you have nothing better to do than troll people on the internet? üòÇ please touch some grass, make some friends... do something productive lmao
She was wonderful, and I don‚Äôt blame you. I‚Äôm a foreigner, I watched from thousands of miles away and I was proud to be a woman today. God bless x
Me also... Feeling proud to be an American. Never realized how much I loved my Country until 1/6/21 we almost lost it.
@GetIt GoingOn You SHOULDNT feel less than out of fear of how someone else might view your confidence, you should say it loud IM BLACK AND IM PROUD!............Well at least I do anyway
@GetIt GoingOn You should be proud of the person you are and if you‚Äôre white be proud of that! It SHOULDN‚ÄôT be inequality unless you say it with Ill-intent, but nothing wrong with freedom of speech and showing how proud you are to be you! If you aren‚Äôt proud of who you are than inequality isn‚Äôt your issue my good sir
@Mrs KeeShia2you if I go around talking about how proud I am to be white some folks are going to say it's racism. See the inequality??
@A.C Reginald, I hope you find peace Have a glorious Thursday!
@GetIt GoingOn I‚Äôm just a black woman proud to be in the skin I‚Äôm in! It shouldn‚Äôt create division. I‚Äôm sorry my confidence makes you feel less than or uncomfortable
@fisher king that‚Äôs the beauty of what this young lady did when she spoke this poem, she gave us all something we can cherish and take differently then others, but come out with the same hopefulness!
@Mrs KeeShia2you but Trump is better than Biden. And you‚Äôre not being oppressed either way
@Mrs KeeShia2you ok ok
@Mrs KeeShia2you Elon Musk doesn't go around saying he's a White American. That creates devision not unity
@A.C yes that is what I said sir!
@A.C No just confident!
KeeShia I'm not black not a woman and not American and still I'm proud that humanity can produce such wonderful gems as Amanda it shows that there IS hope for America after the past four years
@Mrs KeeShia2you oppressors ?
@Mrs KeeShia2you that sounds conceited just saying
@Facts Over Feelings Good for you!
@A.C I‚Äôm obsessed with my cocoa brown skin and my intellectual mind and my resilience to my oppressors, my wittiness to see ignorance and not react negatively, but to respectfully disagree and let positivity prevail...
@GetIt GoingOn I am a strong black woman first! And I am very proud to be an American! I don‚Äôt understand what any other race has to do with a statement about me, but thank you for your unsolicited opinion anyway
@Sgt Koranflusher When you go low, we go high! Have a lovely day
@GetIt GoingOn for real. Some people are super obsessed with racism and the color of people‚Äôs skin they can‚Äôt let it go.
You're an American first of all. Who cares that you're black. White and Asians don't have to throw this in every sentence
I know what you mean. I wake up every day, proud to be a white man in America.
She restores my faith in humanity.
Amen
Yes Bro
·Éí·Éò·Éü·Éò
@Son Dang oh don‚Äôt get it twisted sweetheart, I‚Äôm proud to be black every single day of my life JUST this day was extra special!
Should be proud everyday.
AMAZING!
Boooooo
Absolutely Beautiful!!
Class act. Best part of the inauguration for me. üôèüèª
Very powerful. What an amazing young lady. God bless America.
I don't understand why I almost cried watching this.
I've seen it twice now and got a tear in my eye each time
@Betty Boop Give me examples of 'common sense from DT, pray tell.
@rattlesnake81 I would rather hear common sense and plain speaking than the "eloquence" you get from your 40 year career politicians as they lie to the cameras and line their pockets.
Tears of relief.
Almost! Bawling üò≠ each time I watch it!!! Touches my soul!‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüî•üôåüèæ

Almost? I went through a box of tissue
@Betty Boop you're just orange from envy. He was never so eloquent and well-spoken which I'd probably where your jealousy comes from.
@Betty Boop yeah you jealous
@Betty Boop yeah like the full of hatred capitol stormers' orange ape fans. I choose this
Because they are using tired emotional tropes to influence your feeling and thinking. Just like you see them do with advertising. It's all propoganda.

Me too and I'm not even American üò≠
Tremendous talent wasted on political pandering, manufactured fear, hate of our founding, and erasing our history. Democrats have perverted the cause of the greatest civil rights leader ever born, MLK Jr. She was absolutely brilliant ‚Äû...where a skinny black girl, descended from slaves, raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president," but then she sucked up to the government elitists. Great speech, I would only ask that she think for herself. Give us what is truly in your heart and you will turn heads.
I mean first, you gotta earn respect from the elitists in order to get your platform. And then you can go rogue and say what you want. If this girl went rogue here, she'd have been shut down, but now she has their respect.
That's not poetry. :(
Not you saying that...
Amazing poetry..amazing. congratulations
POWERFUL!
Amazing!
What a beautiful poem and recitation. Don't get the dislikes -- too many words for the twitter addicts?
Magnificent.
The emotions and power of that poem was felt all the way here in Canada. I have listen to this poem several times now and I still get chills.
Very powerful and a poem for the ages. Wisdom of someone much older-or tempered by experiences in her background. The only operative wording I question is "scripture tells us"- and the gender specific term "man"
You are amazing..America is in love with you.
This young lady is a star shining bright.

Amazing speech...from an Amazing young lady!!! Awesome!
democrats' are parasites
My goodness I never heard of this young lady until today and only heard bits and pieces of her poem, but after seeing this young lady on CNN tonight all I can say is wow! This young lady is awesome. Her mannerisms, humbleness and intellect is out of this world! This young lady is cut from a different cloth! You don't see young people or old that embodies the characteristics that this young lady has. And oh her teeth are perfect..lol

JUst seen on TV that this Young Lady overcame a Speech Impediment just a few years ago ......Amazing Young Girl .
She is.
She was far better than the president speech! Bravo !
I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot of her in the new future. Very smart, articulate, and charismatic.
Such poise and presence!
Number 1 !!!!! I love her! Smart and lovely!!!
Beautiful poetry!!!

I have watched this Powerful Piece of Poetry twice now. Once live and again just now. Both times I have gotten full body Chills. This Young Strong Black Woman is someone to watch. She Is the Next Maya Angelou. I see her becoming President later in her life!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
All the quotes I could get from this
"What just is, isn't always justice"
Powerful
1 Word.. ?
Absolutely beautiful. This is the finest hour among the finest day. Among the finest individuals: givers, empathy and love and respect
You're easily impressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ratEMJ7zU
Wow!! As someone not American, living in another country, a spectator to the last 5 divisive, chaotic years, Amanda's beautiful and brilliant words even gives me hope for America.
Her vocabulary was a bit much for my tiny brain.
Amanda Gorman beautiful poetry well spoken
Joe Biden you're a joke. You fooled people into thinking they are woke.
My god! An accurate poem!
Lady of the match! ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèΩü§ó
Why does it always have to be a Black person reciting a poem that's really not a poem but a personally political sermon during the inauguration? Blacks are NOT the only race that suffered.... Look, i know eggs and rotten tomatoes will be a-flyin' my way, but I must voice my true feeling about this poem- recitation thing... I worked for Black churches for many years and yes, a lot of Black folks are gifted speakers naturally...any average guy/ lady sitting in the pew can give a rousing sermon any time....but that doesn't mean much when it comes to getting things done or solving problems. I found it annoying that they always make it a "Black" thing to represent people's suffering and struggles when in fact, Blacks in this country have a lot of help and support and they get entitlements that people of different skin colors don't get.
üëè
Wow! Ms. Gorman beautifully captured the struggle of American culture.
She was AMAZING!!!‚ù§üòçü§©‚ù§
For those who have and ear to hear, the kingdom of the most high is here you can also hear it in her speech for those who know him and the scrip, he is in the earth,a kingdom divided against itself would not stand mark 3-13 in the end we all will have to come together and that purpose is his love and his love is how much we can sacrifice ourselves to help each other arise even over personal terrible circumstances today she express the perfect example of us even what the nex Generation will have to survive and that love is precious and not weak ,this is what the children of Israel where to achieve in the wilderness the land flowing with milk and honey Jerusalem is spiritual place my friends not the place that can see a city that defends each other from evil forces that separates us ,, the kingdom of heaven is within you and among you luke 17-21
This entire farce was so cringe worthy.... ‚ÄãIts clear as day no one voted for Biden.
Speechless
Just Love üíï
THANK YOU FATHER! THANK U FOR LOVING US SO MUCH THROUGH MS. AMANDA GORMAN. BLESS U FOR YOUR OBEDIENCE.!
Amen
She gave words to the pleadings of our hearts. This young woman is a true poet/prophet/truth sayer.
How elegant and eloquent a contrast to the hubris from which we have escaped.
Hearing and seeing this young lady make wish I am American,
Wow! Such Beauty! Great job Young Lady!
üêê
Oogaa boogaa
She is so inspirational. She made everyone look rIdIcUloUS
So, the comment I posted was meant to be a joke. I was being sarcastic. Of course Biden and lady Gaga were amazing. I didn‚Äôt mean to offend anyone and if I did, I‚Äôm sorry.
@Jeffrey Hinkel While I agree it was a political assertion, I still think it was a well written speech with a positive message. What is really divisive is how nowadays, for one thing to be deemed as "good" something else has to be put down, like the OP demonstrated. That mentality is what makes social media so toxic.
Why does her speech have to take away from something else in order to be good?
I know her words just hit really hard and it made me feel so much better about this country seeing it from this woman‚Äôs perspective
Biden and Lady Gaga were also inspirational.
BEAUTIFUL!
that was a beautiful poem!
I believe people are starting...just starting to learn why racism is wrong. It causes damage so great that it takes centuries to repair.
Hon the war against slavery in America ended 150 years ago. That battle has been fought and won. If you care so much about slavery then why don't you focus your attention on modern- day slavery like the children who made your iPhone...
SHE SERVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my God, this girl was everything!! Yes Yes Yes!!! Her words are the new constitution to have present in our hearts in this present time of 2020 Covid (entering 2021).
Style: 100; Substance: 0
It‚Äôs 2021 not 2020
We'll need a new constitution, the old one clearly doesn't apply anymore. Democrats have just urinated all over it.
Obama and Kamala will put Ol' Droolin', Groopin' Joe back in the basement within 2 months. Kamala then takes over and Obama pulls the strings. I don't think the USA has much of a chance...Green-Socialist Indoctrination in the schools has twisted the minds of young people for the last 30 years...Time to "Reap the Whirlwind".
Such beautiful words, such beautiful American soul.
Today will be a great day for our great president Donald J Trump. He got us here with a clear understanding of where we need be and go from here. Truth justice and the American way is coming back for all Americans equally and with careful vigilance, we will keep up the good fight to make sure that freedom continues for all Americans‚ò∫Ô∏èüá∫üá∏ü§ó And on a Safety Note Peaceful transfer of power, promises made promises kept by President Donald J Trump!!! Thank you for your service sir, we will not forget you!!!@@

Tears that's what I felt. I am so proud even more to be who I am. Well done. I received the great message
So American. Brave enough to form a union with purpose...harmony for all. Lincoln and Dr King watching over Ms Amanda Gorman and smiling.
Thanks to all the black children 12 and younger who voted in this election otherwise we would have been stuck with someone who doesn't want another crime bill to lock up super predators.
Why is CNBC ruining this video with that sign right across the screen?? We get, we know who you are. Give this young lady the recognition she deserves without distraction.
If perhaps she (Amanda Gorman) is looking for Job, just come here in Africa I will employ you. I am looking for a talented mind
üòÅüòå
@orange moon glows I know,but i am just saying if perhaps she is looking for work,may be to be an orator
@gilmar morais what kind of work? i doubt she needs your work with her book deals, etc. she's makin money herself.
@orange moon glows to work
to do what?
Biden/Harris are traitors
as a black man this was so cringey to watch. she swore she did sum LMAOO
As Marcus Garvey says intelligence rules the world and ignorance carries a burden, it is sad to say you are one of those black men with such burden, I do not think you are a black man for a moment.
F them alll there Satan Worshipers
üòàüòàüòàüòàüòàüòà
She should be hired as one of Biden's speech writers. SHE DID A GREAT JOB!!! She will be on every talk show tomorrow and sign her poetry book deal the day after tomorrow!! Such a lovely young lady!!
"For there is always light, if only we are brave enough to see it, if only we are brave enough to be it."
Just WOW!!!
democratic party is a communist party in USA. joe biden is a communist. He will destroy USA. Keep waiting for how he ruins America! joe is in same side with CCP. CCP gradually infiltrates USA and make Red Scare come truth. Keep waiting!
OMG !! GOD bless you I am a 59 year old white man and you are the most inspiring thing that I have ever seen . Unbelievable you brought tears to my eyes of joy and hope
Amanda gorman please come here in Philippines

I have respectfully translated this beautiful Master Piece to Spanish. This is History, and must be made available. (Disclaimer: I do NOT claim, declare, profess to be a master-translator, simply saw an opportunity to share something of high value. If you have suggestions on changes to the translation, you may leave your comment here.) --- Until someone else is willing to translate it officially, here it is: La Colina que Subimos Cuando llega el d√≠a nos preguntamos d√≥nde podemos encontrar luz en esta sombra sin fin. La p√©rdida que llevamos en el mar debemos vadearla. Hemos desafiado el vientre de la bestia. Hemos aprendido que la tranquilidad no es siempre la paz. En las normas y nociones de lo que es justo no siempre es la justicia. Y a√∫n as√≠, el amanecer es nuestro antes de que nos demos cuenta. De alguna manera hemos resistido. De alguna manera hemos sido testigos de una naci√≥n que no est√° rota, sino simplemente inacabada. Nosotros, los sucesores de un pa√≠s y una √©poca en la que una delgada chica negra descendiente de esclavos y criada por una madre soltera puede so√±ar con volverse presidente, s√≥lo para encontrarse recitando ante uno. Y s√≠, estamos lejos de ser pulidos, lejos de ser pr√≠stinos, pero eso no significa que nos esforcemos por formar una uni√≥n perfecta. Nos esforzamos por forjar nuestra uni√≥n con un prop√≥sito. Componer un pa√≠s comprometido con todas las culturas, colores, caracteres y condiciones del hombre. As√≠ que no miramos lo que se interpone entre nosotros, sino lo que est√° delante de nosotros. Cerramos la brecha porque sabemos que para poner nuestro futuro en primer lugar, primero debemos poner nuestras diferencias a un lado. Bajamos nuestros brazos para poder extenderlos hacia el otro. No buscamos el da√±o a nadie y la armon√≠a para todos. Dejemos que el mundo, aunque sea, diga que esto es verdad. Que incluso en nuestra pena, crecimos. Que incluso cuando nos dol√≠a, no perd√≠amos la fe. Que Incluso cuando nos cans√°bamos, intent√°bamos, que siempre estaremos atados en la victoria. No porque nunca m√°s conozcamos la derrota, sino porque nunca m√°s sembraremos la divisi√≥n. La Escritura nos dice que imaginemos que cada uno se sentar√° bajo su propia vi√±a e higuera y nadie le har√° temer. Si queremos estar a la altura de su tiempo, la victoria no estar√° en el filo, sino en todos los puentes que hemos construido. √âsa es la promesa de brillar, la colina que subiremos si nos atrevemos. Es porque ser Norte Americano es m√°s que un orgullo que heredamos. Es el pasado en el que hemos entrado y c√≥mo lo repararemos. Hemos visto un bosque que destrozar√≠a nuestra naci√≥n en lugar de compartirlo. Destruir√≠a nuestro pa√≠s si eso significara retrasar la democracia, y este esfuerzo estuvo a punto de tener √©xito. La democracia puede retrasarse peri√≥dicamente, pero nunca ser√° derrotada permanentemente. En esta verdad, en esta fe en la que confiamos tenemos los ojos puestos en el futuro. La historia tiene los ojos puestos en nosotros. Esta es la era de la justa redenci√≥n La temimos en sus inicios. No nos sent√≠amos preparados para ser los herederos de una hora tan aterradora, pero dentro de ella, nos empoderamos a escribir un nuevo cap√≠tulo, de ofrecernos esperanza y risas a nosotros mismos, as√≠ que una vez nos preguntamos, ¬øc√≥mo podr√≠amos prevalecer sobre la cat√°strofe? Ahora afirmamos, ¬øc√≥mo podr√≠a la cat√°strofe prevalecer sobre nosotros? No regresaremos a lo que fue, sino que nos trasladaremos a lo que ser√° un pa√≠s magullado, √≠ntegro, benevolente pero audaz, feroz y libre. No nos daremos la vuelta ni seremos interrumpidos por la intimidaci√≥n porque sabemos que nuestra inacci√≥n e inercia ser√° la herencia de la pr√≥xima generaci√≥n. Nuestros errores se convierten en sus cargas. Pero una cosa es segura, si unimos la misericordia con la fuerza y la fuerza con el derecho, entonces el amor se convierte en nuestro legado y cambia el patrimonio de nuestros hijos. As√≠ que dejemos un pa√≠s mejor que el que nos dejaron. Cada aliento de mi pecho bronceado elevar√° este mundo herido a uno maravilloso. Nos levantaremos de las colinas doradas del oeste. Nos levantaremos del noreste donde nuestros antepasados hicieron la revoluci√≥n. Nos levantaremos de las ciudades del borde del lago de los estados del Medio Oeste. Nos levantaremos desde el soleado Sur. Reconstruiremos, conciliaremos y nos recuperaremos en cada rinc√≥n conocido de nuestra naci√≥n, en cada rinc√≥n llamado nuestro pa√≠s, nuestro pueblo diverso y hermoso emerger√° maltrecho y hermoso. Cuando llegue el d√≠a, saldremos de la sombra en llamas y sin miedo. El nuevo amanecer florece mientras lo liberamos. Porque siempre hay luz. Si tan s√≥lo fu√©ramos lo suficientemente valientes para verla. Si tan s√≥lo fu√©ramos lo suficientemente valientes para serlo. - Amanda Gorman
Of course, a Cult follower won't get this - it's above their pay grade. LOVED IT AND SO MEMORABLE.
@Joy L Why do women always take the ball and go home (metaphorically) when they're losing an argument. Lol. I hope you take what I said and learn from it. Don't be the thing you hate and don't be hypocritical. üéµThe Endüéµ
@Mr. Meerkat Maybe you haven't read the negative comments on here that Exactly do that. Rather than respond to each one individually, I posted this AFTER my 'compliment only' post. President Biden also said we should be able to disagree with each other but still move on, find a middle ground. If you're not a Cult follower, my comment shouldn't offend/bother you. THE END.
@Joy L Your main focus/ intention here was to hurl insults/offend those who's political ideology opposes yours. The compliment you payed the young lady was an after thought. Remember what Biden said about unity?
@Joy L I meant you lol
@Mr. Meerkat Exactly
Why can't people compliment someone without insulting someone?
Magnificent.
Exactly what we needed. Thank You!

@PocketAces23 imagine assuming someone's political affiliation from the safe space of your grandmother's basement, while having no job, no home, no friends and no hope.
@PocketAces23 man stfu before I take all your money üí∞ you bluff like Biden bones
I agree. I can‚Äôt stop thinking how profound this was. How she said all the things I‚Äôve been thinking about for the past four years. So eloquent and sophisticated for a twenty two year old. For any age. Her words understood and visions practiced could move mountains, make the world a better place for those who would listen. Humanity humbled. I am sorry for those who don‚Äôt see the wisdom in her words, truly, because this is how America will heal. If you are not on board then leave or shut up. We voted you out, get over it. We will do this without you.
@PocketAces23 Got real quiet all of a sudden. Lol. Keep playing that online poker nerd. Trolling doesn't suit you.
@PocketAces23 nice attempt at gaslighting, actually it was pathetic. You don't know the first thing about what I look like or how much money I make. And if you wanna try me in person we can arrange.
@PocketAces23 You just made me laugh out loud. üòÇüòÇ

@Denise Do you ever say anything else? You literally paste the same thing on every comment you disagree with. How lazy.
You must have a very, very short memory. As short as Biden's memory, or worse.
@Jeffrey Hinkel are you sad that orange man lost? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Yes indeed ‚ô•Ô∏è
@Jeffrey Hinkel go cry somewhere. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
Great poet and message that MEANS A LOT - just awesome !!!
Lame slam poetry that doesn't mean anything.
This was beautiful
Amanda Gorman I am so proud. You made my heart calm. Thank you for sharing your gift of words distinctly, clearly and precise. God Bless you
Just stunning.
Wow..wow..wow am not American but folks I watched it like 100 times. This will go down in history as one of the most memorable moments in presidential inaugurations. So powerful
It‚Äôs already has!!!
@Apollo The Moon Man I know your one of those trolls trying to get people to be angry at your comments to get a reaction so like be salty somewhere else will you.....
@Apollo The Moon Man go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
@Apollo The Moon Man Yes.
No
Yas! Beauty!
Token black girl to convince the masses that Bidens previous racist comments didn't mean that he is racist.
I'm tired of the blatant disrespect towards young black women. She's not a "token black girl." She's a Harvard graduate and a poet laureate. What have you achieved during your lifetime... let me guess --nothing!
She overcame her speech impediment!!! Just 2 years ago she struggled to say her R's, and now she is just mesmerizing. So great!
Don't look at just the performance listen to the content too just wow
If you watch her interviews from a couple years ago you can hear her speech is different. She's worked so hard to overcome it. Such a talent!!
Very interesting as President Biden also stuttered.
I couldn't tell.
The true brilliance of this poem can only be unlocked after twice viewing. Amazing.
Amazing!
She is the light and the youth and the awesomeness of America. She is what makes the nervous ones nervous. She is the future. üí•
This was so inspiring. Who are the stone-hearted people who thumbs-downed this?
Sad trolls mate
Irish history goes back 700 years. Downtrodden by Britain. Manufacturer's of neighbour against neighbour. Man against man. Brother against brother. They still prevail. Can't own up. Can't be peace
This brilliant human!!!!!
She‚Äôs a beautiful young woman. Very articulate.
Don't spoil your talent supporting the wrong people
Genius
2.3K DISLIKES, IT'S HASN'T EVEN BEEN A DAY!! THEY NEED TO WATCH THIS AGAIN!!
My goodness...she stole d show.. Such brilliance.. America happy you; breathe out and breathe in..
Wow üò≥what she said! Beautiful
Henceforth a new genre on TikTok ...
3:09: ‚ÄúBut, while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.‚Äù Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia: Yup!
2.4K dislike sounds like 2.4K of trumps alts or alt bot by trump
Simply remarkable. Trying to praise I find my words inadequate in the light of hers.

Watched and heard you from Northern Ireland. Know about division. Bigots/racists spew lies to create a fear. Leads to neighbour against neighbour. Distrust, hatred. We were woken up in 1968. Took another 30 years to get us some semblance of equality. Your struggle is 400 years and going still. Fear of dealing with inequality is the problem. Too many with baggage in their past to own up too. Fear that they if they came clean would be treated as they treated others. Afraid of themselves
There isn't an issue with equality. That battle has been fought and won for generations. There is an issue with race- baiting Democrat politicians, they've found a gimmick that gets them votes and they will beat that dead horse until it's putrid.
So well written and delivered, I know that no matter how many times I listen to it I'll always find a new nugget of beautifully crafted wisdom.
Black poet....how appropriate .....have to keep the racial crap going The world is watching and laughing.......another communist country is born
@Madison It has everything to do with race and you know it. That's their gimmick, that's their shtick, gotta keep up the race- baiting thing over a war that was won 150 years ago.
She‚Äôs literally a poet laureate from Harvard... it has nothing to do with race. Why do people like you always focus on race? You just find new ways to make yourself mad. Sucks to be you I guess
If only some of those many angry and hate filled people would listen to this and just open their hearts to kindness and decency !

Deceive the masses with a judadite poem smh so sad
the sadness lies within you . Hope you can find the time to listen to this young adults poem(speech) again with an open mind while thinking about someone dear to you and for whom you have loftier expectations and hope. For without hope..there is only despair. Best Wishes and written without malice
If you look up "charisma" in the dictionary, guess whose name you'll see. I thought everyone was doing great today, then Amanda came on, then I remembered what great was. She's one in a million.
This is a generational speech, a speech which will transcend the political divide. It is a speech which recognises that the healing process must commence now, that all have a part to play in the future of the United States. Amanda's delivery was exceptional, her words inspirational and the timing of such a message, in a word perfect. Let both the red and blue stripes combine to bring prosperity, hope and health back to a country who has been beaten and bruised for the past 4 years.
Deam...deam girl ... I digyou...i feel you
I would love to have her as president. Also the younger the president the more they will care about our future.
Stunning
If Antifa/BLM connects with White House, Biden will be impeached or fired.
What are you on about? This thread is about Amanda Gorman.
That was stunning. This gives me hope :)

I had shivers hearing this.
Amanda, you have an incredible gift as a poet but above that you have a heart and soul that allows others to question
The Hill We Climb‚Äù Amanda Gorman When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast, we‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is, isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it, somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect, we are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew, even as we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired, we tried, that we‚Äôll forever be tied together victorious, not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in in all of the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. That would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy, and this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can periodically be delayed, but it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us, this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves, so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us. We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be, a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free, we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, our blunders become their burden. But one thing is certain: if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left, with every breath from my bronze, pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one, we will rise from the golden hills of the West, we will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution, we will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked South, we will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful, when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid, the new dawn blooms as we free it, for there is always light if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
@Mari Fisk Rise Up!!
Thank you Also, is anyone hearing Hamilton references in the poem besides me?
Lol.....and...nobody in South Africa would believe this dribble....
Thank you for the lyrics
This young lady...so good...so powerful...so moving! Thank you
Enegildo Pe√±a. Esplendor de la noche, dedicado a Amanda Gorman. Es el color del esplendor de la noche,/ tejida en la luz de las estrellas/ y las palabras./ En sus ojos se vuelve/ al pasado y el presente. Terrible agon√≠a que nos precede,/ en sus caderas de tedio y miedo,/ pero su coraz√≥n de signos y de m√∫sicas,/ nos asombra y nos ilumina./ Estoy aqu√≠, en un pa√≠s,/ donde solo los poetas nos alimentan./ Tendido aqu√≠,/ en una realidad nueva y virtualizada./ Escucho sus versos en una lengua que no es la m√≠a,/ sin embargo, la entiendo en el coraz√≥n que solo siento./ Trasciendo el alma las cosas y poema que lees,/ mientras el instinto solo me qu√≠a./ (Nota: en proceso de escritura, hecho ahora mismo viendo Miercoletras).
‚ÄúGee squidward maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said.‚Äù
That's what I call pure poetry. Applies to any nation in this troubled, angry world where lies become truth. The truth will always out. Unfortunately too late for many
Regardless of your political views, this poem just sucks. She is completely talentless, this is just some rubbish. She is only there because she is a young black woman.
@G k but obviously she was trying hard to impress someone lol. This poem is about fake experience and selfhood made out of political nuggets. No one really relates to this stuff.
Poetry can be whatever the writer wants it to be. And she's surely not trying to impress you üôÉ
This is our Future and she is Heartening
Beautiful!
Beautiful
Powerful
She is a remarkable writer. So impressed!üôèüèºüôåüèº
SOOO CORNY!!! JUST READ THE BIBLE!!! EVERYTHING IS THERE!!! you bet!!!
Thank you Amanda. Cometh the hour, cometh the woman x
"While democracy can be periodically delayed, it can not be permanently defeated" Thank God and Amen.
@Water Dubz They are diametrically opposed to each other in principle. Our REPUBLIC is based on an already agreed to set of laws which no amount of 'democracy' can change by a vote. Yet this is something democrat fake liberals today constantly try to chip at and often with the help of Republican fake conservatives. Biden and Harris are already doing it! If you don't understand the difference you should not be allowed to vote.
@Sgt Koranflusher yep. All true. Just wish the other half of America would wake the hell up and see that too.
@George Washingpun They don't have to abolish the electoral college now that they have established that Americans will sit by and let them commit vast election fraud. ALL the vote counting is done by Democrats and Democrat run/owned voting machines and their is no plans to change any of that. There will and can never be a true election in the USA again without civil war. And all this is covered up by a complicit media system owned by 5 corporations in agreement with each other.
In other words, it's only "democracy" if the outcome fits her agenda. Disgusting message. Bad poem.
@Sgt Koranflusher nobody knows that. They want to abolish the electoral college and make it a 50/50 vote. And that is when the US will officially descend into anarchy.
@Sgt Koranflusher they share very similar ideologies don‚Äôt know how that holds any relevance though.
@Snore Lax humanity**
YES! one of my favorite part... but I love it all
Did you know that America is a Constitutional Republic...? ...Not a democracy. Do you know the difference? I doubt it!
Lets hope so. Democracy is pure evil.

üôèüèø
Incredible!
The crazy thing is that she must've written this in two weeks.
@J M Trump supporter? No, he‚Äôs a clown. Why do you automatically assume that anyone who disagrees with you is a Trump supporter? I didn‚Äôt find her poem to be that good, and I‚Äôm simply pointing out that she‚Äôs only getting praised because of her race and political affiliation.
@Lupe Guadaloupe Not really. I'm white, so you will understand just how 'privileged' I am. I just don't do make believe. Ever. It's not cynicism. Or pessimism. It's realism and pragmatism. You should try it.
If she did what a brain she has. People here in comments that are jealous of her. They can't see good In people's words. It don't surprise me. But i thought there might be some people say look its time for peace. Clearly people don't want people because of the misinformation Trump has fed people
@Derek Spitz is cynicism your default attitude? What a hard life that must be.
‚Äã@J M It's really not that good. And two weeks to compose isn't especially impressive either. Don't get me wrong. It's not a terrible effort. Just not worth the hysterical and hyperbolic reactions that it seems to be getting from some people. If the poem was written by a young white woman you can be very sure it would not be getting the same response. Which can only lead one to conclude that those who are gushing about it are doing so for political reasons.
@Facts Over Feelings if you're a Trump supporter calling us brainwashed that is the most hypocritical thing I have ever heard.
@Derek Spitz because writing a poem that good in 2 weeks is very inspiring and surprising
@Facts Over Feelings In years to come your words will be forgotten while her words will live on for generations.In years to come yours and mine children's,children's children will learn those words in school and know her name.
@Water Dubz What did I say that was demeaning towards her? Nothing at all.
@Facts Over Feelings please tell, I‚Äôm curious. What makes you think that demeaning a young woman over her poem because of a difference in opinion is right? What ever happen to constructive criticism? But please, ‚Äúgo against he flow‚Äù and say this isn‚Äôt worthy of praise because she didn‚Äôt write something as worthy from Aristotle. Doubt you could‚Äôve made anything better.
@Facts Over Feelings Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
@fisher king You‚Äôre brainwashed.
@DiMonte Baker Or maybe you just want to feel good about yourself by going along with what everyone tells you you should think. It was an ok poem, but certainly not worthy of the praise that‚Äôs being spewed out.
@Facts Over Feelings you don't recognise greatness right in front of you
It really doesn‚Äôt take much to impress you people, does it?
In competitions usually we are just given a subject and maybe an hr or hours to write. So 2wks are still fine she might've revised it a couple of times.. she did great
·Éó·Éï·Éò·Éó
Why is that 'crazy'?
She did...she said on a PBS interview that she started the poem early Jan before the insurrection occurred...that this was the direction she felt led to go then 6 Jan occurred and confirmed her poems natural trajectory. She inspires and is wise beyond her 22 years. Should God bless me to see 2036, she has my vote!
So powerful, beautiful and inspirational. I love this, and the confidence and erudite eloquence in which she presented it. From Canada... wishing Biden and his administration well in undoing and healing the damage done the last 4 years. Congrats, and cheers!!
BRAVO!!
I hope I'll be forgiven for saying her hairdo is awesome.

Those Hamilton References just made a perfect poem 10x better
WHAT A FRAUD, SAD DAY FOR AMERICA
Wow, wow, wow.
Not since "Ask NOT what your country can do for you. Ask what YOU can do for your country" has there been more eloquent words spoken on a US Inauguration. This lady has a bright future! Well done, indeed.
‚ÄúForge a union with purpose‚Äù UNITYüíú
We just witnessed the biggest crime of our life time. Satan party/ Pedo party. Where's Tom Hanks?

Trump left a word to Biden "Joe, you know I won" It's true! Shame on you Biden
Words do not fail her, but they fail me in trying to express how incredible this young lady is.
@Catiniya Her message is a lie in response to lies.
@Jace Bb My job is to bash the clown heads back down into their holes.
@Sgt Koranflusher if your so renowned stop responding to literally every comment lmfao. Not only does no one care but ur wasting your time:/
@Sgt Koranflusher Whoever you are, you're 100% correct.
@Sgt Koranflusher idc if its good or bad. her messages were still outstanding and important.
@Sgt Koranflusher shush troll.
@Richard Lipov I am actually, "published" you dum-dum. ..and I live with a published poet. And also well travelled and well read on History.... hence my handle.
@Sgt Koranflusher I look forward to more bad poetry from her. The messages she was making were melodic, and inspirational as well as her in person recitation. Your handle as Koranflusher identifies you as an angry person. I doubt you have credentials as a literary critic.
You know little about poetry. She is actually pretty bad at it!

10% dislikes! who the F are these people? Did they just click on this link for the sole purpose to dislike? Are there CNBC viewers who just don't like Black women? Or are there just so many jealous poets out there, hating?
I'm not even American and I teared up at this. How on earth does this Masterpiece have over 2k dislikes??????
@Josephine Bournes not all trump supporters are salty. Don‚Äôt assume.
@beautifulchaos13 hello again Russia
Women‚Äôz Beauty Channel the fake new media  biden pelosi harris all dems unfortunately have divide the country w their false narratives  inciting violence all summer blm etc
Because its racist woke claptrap. Rubbish.
To the haters of all Trump supporters. I didn't vote Biden. I do think this young American shines like a star and is a bright example of a true American. She is talented, articulate, poised, and beautiful. I don't think she would want us spewing hate in defense of her beautiful heart. Love what she has to say on a beautiful inauguration day. Ghandi said, "Be the change you want to see." ‚ù§
Jealousy- that‚Äôs all
Those are just trolls. They've gone to almost all Inauguration footage to dislike the content. That's okay. Love, decency, democracy, good---we won.
2k people trying to stand up for their overlord and savior trump
@Joel Lambert Not unable, but unwilling..
Don't look at the dislikes look how many people liked and watched itüòå All those likes are people whom were amazed and inspired by her speech. Truely wonderfullüòç
As she said, The norms of "just is" is not justice!" Let that sink in. Now to, "be brave enough to be the light!"
Dislikes dont matter honey.....think of 20k goosebumps
It was cringe
@Kilal Googlestaffers... Sold
You really don't know how this speech can have now 3.3k dislikes? She's an intelligent, conscientious, Black female reciting a socially relevant poem at the inauguration of a democratic president.
Same
If we've learned anything; disagreement is constant and OK. How we treat each other everyday matters. We still have to solve problems together. Instead of finger-pointing at others; push your voice in your local communities (where change really happens).
BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED THEY DONT SEE HER AS AN AMERICAN THEY SEE HER AS BIDEN SUPPORT OR DEMOCRAT WE NEED TO STOP THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS (over 72 millions) OR BIDEN SUPPORTERS NARRATIVE YOURE ALL AMERICANS REGARDLESS YOUR DIFFERENCES
@Josephine Bournes Those are the white supremacists.
You are Human . That matters :)
Trump supporters. Their poet would be a proud boy or Rudy.
You can tell they are Trump supporters. The enemy of progress.
Don‚Äôt worry, those are the trump‚Äôs mob. They are losers
all Republicans?
They're evil, mean and nasty people just like their dear departed leader.
All Trump supporters across the globe including nigeria Christians
From the American racist!!
@Josephine Bournes and bots which are rampant on youtube
They are called proud Boys aka KKK
Cowards unable to think outside the box they live in.
@DrRestezi True, I wouldn't doubt a good portion of those dislikes were race-related. Absolutely disgraceful
@Michelle Baldwin Facts, even one dislike on this vid is an injustice
Yeah, that's the most plausible theory. Trump supporters just can't take the L gracefully. Sad
Sadly there will alway be haters. They are miserable people who will never be happy no matter what.
2700 racists can't appreciate poetry and wisdom from a young woman of colour.
or any
Those 2K dislikes represent salty trump supporters ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Her words made history today Awesome Job
What an amazing voice! Youngest Poet Laureate delivered some very important lines.
This young lady in unbelievably amazing: her words stirred my soul.
Martin Luther King, Jr. had a Dream! It lives !!!!! as a poem delivered at the right time in history by a young lady, full of strength and precision with the radiance of a beautiful light. Love and hope is always there when you/ WE need it. God bless ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you üôè

Thank you for taking the time to print this out!
Amazing...
What was done to us in 2020 is long gone by Trump and this virus she'll never reupear the Lord shall see the way for us now even though we have a new president don t he s going to improve for this nation is our God and only
I don't like Biden, but I like her!!!
Yes, but note that Biden's wife invited her to the inauguration. To me that shows the Bidens' appreciation of great talent and openness to youth. No more spite or envy in the White House.
The way she uses her hands to accent her words. Just amazing.
Beautiful. Best part of the whole show.
It wasn't really poetic but okay
A poem to a white nationalist and racist "I don't want my children to be raised in racial jungle"
Beautifully delivered. This is your future, treasure.
I have no doubt that this poem will be taught in our classrooms to future generations of Americans.
So perfect for this time in our country. The Arts are a way to heal, communicate, know each other. Art is not a thing , it is a way.
You want to heal by banging on and on about slavery that ended 150 years ago. While ignoring actual slavery today. Beijing Biden has lined his pockets off the profits of slave labor in China. But nobody talks about that
HOW COULD ANYONE DOWNVOTE THIS?!?
What powerful words! Amanda you're truly an inspiration and America is *So Proud* of you!
At 22, she has superseded many adults. Very talented and filled with self-esteemed. Hope young adults saw her speech.
Wow. Such a beautiful poem. I am at a loss of words..
I had chills the whole time.
Why Trump you did this to our lost world but now we are comeing back we are not going back wards now we must go forward that's what's up now ha ha
Roses are red , violets are blue, now the swamp is back in power, to give power to the few. We are told Trump was a liar but Bidens words are true. There will be no more investigations or accusations, and the globalist will tell the US what to do.
MASTERFUL
What great insight manifested in a profound poem. Well done!
Beautiful, well written, and well said.
She was at her best today!

She was AMAZING!! Half Eminem and Half Dr Seuss..
lmaoo
Makes my heart soar 3
If she ran for president in the future I would totally vote for her ....but ...im Canadian lol
That‚Äôs a lot of words. Hope something comes from them.
You are a strong, talented and courageous young woman. God bless you and God bless America!
Yeah, but can you pass a Calculus exam?
üëèüëèBeautiful!
This poem is the beginning of telling the truth in this country.
@Encore Baby People who believe in conspiracy theories don't ever remember facts. You know exactly what I mean. I don't think your brain is completely gone... I hope not.
@Encore Baby the earth is round and water is H2O. There is a truth my friend
Yes! Truths like Biden and Harris put more blacks in jail than anybody.
Pretentious, smug, bullsh*t. 100% cringe.
OMG that was beautiful!!
what does this even mean??? I just want a functioning public system
It means huckster race baiting and sappy platitudes to keep the SJWs and Lifetime movie crowd distracted while they rob us
Hamilton quotes , love love love
Amazing! So Young! So inspiring!
Beautiful
Eloquently and powerfully said.She reminds me of the young Lauryn Hill
I‚Äôm not sure what I am anymore but definitely don‚Äôt identify as an American üá∫üá∏. F this country.
I just want to hug her and say ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù. My god that was amazing.
She did an amazing job!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Talk about poetry in motion. She was mesmerizing. Simply brilliant!
That was simply beautiful
She was so good! All her lines had a meaning. "where can we find light in this never ending shade?"What a way to start! Loved it!
aesop rock has more meaningful bars
If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it!!!!!!!!
Gold rings. Old gold, new Gold: Be happy. Perfectly inline with Moses and his golden calf, pulverised. The naphtha sniffing Elias blown to the sky in a hellfire. Gold! Double burps from black holes. Lady Gaga! A black hole singing.
Phenomenal!!
Why does she have to mention that she's a descendant of a slave?
I'm white and my DNA test just told me that I've got ancestry from west Africa. So I'm the descendant of a slave too. BFD it ended 150 years ago let's talk about things that actually matter like why is the government destroying the economy and people's constitutional rights over a cold
She was incredible!!!Best poem I have ever heard.Great job Mom!!You must be so proud.Loved her little gestures...wow!She blew me away.Well done.‚ù§üá®üá¶
Wow. Amazing.
This young lady said everything that this nation should feel and not look back at what was but look to where we are going and look to what our nation can be.
Young butterfly ü¶ã way past her caterpillar stage...
Such a powerful, momentous voice ringing in light and strength. Honored and in awe to share in it.
Amazing. This is the America I know and love.
Lol this is really bad
You are a genius, young woman. I would say a young Maya Angelou!!! You‚Äôre using your brain and beauty for the good of the country. You told the TRUTH. I loved it. We all did. I watched it on tv live and then again, and again. Thank you for this historic moment... a young black woman saluting the first black WOMAN VP!!!!
Magnificent and profoundly touching.
WOW!
Very nice!! Just beutiful poet.üç∑üíû
Wow
Somewhere, there are hordes of Republicans wondering why most of this poem didn't rhyme.
And a few democrats realizing it's merely political prose ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Amazing speech üëèüôå
Amanda, bless you!! Please give Dylan a ring and collaborate, two class artists of different generations would be interesting!!
this is the best thing that has come out of the USA in a long time. this one will be for the history books
Biden looking like he tryna eat that girl
Strikingly beautiful prose. I was awestruck by every stanza. The words were healing after what our country has been through. But the red and yellow is distracting.
She's breathtaking. Something about her presence is captivating.
@Dust Bag She's a actual White liberal, Malcom X warned us about people like her. Just a sidekick for the slave master. SMH

@Wnrc Ltv opposite day is Tuesday FYI
@Germangirl don't vote You should see a doctor. If you ever believe in science again.
@Facts Over Feelings the one who's being a fool is you, thank you!
@maryam tanveer You‚Äôre a fool.
@Facts Over Feelings you dont even understand what she said, she didnt say it's breahtaking because she's black but because of her speech ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, u need to understand before saying something stupid
So many people in this thread getting bothered by a simple compliment about this awesome student. So bitter, Americans do better
@Candy Pop No, you moron, I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs racist to expect less from her or set the bar lower for her because she‚Äôs black. That‚Äôs exactly what happened with her. Deal with it.
@Facts Over Feelings bruh nobody said anything about race. they were complimenting the girl as a person. so now you're saying it's racist for us to compliment people of colour? what an idiot
@Candy Pop I absolutely ‚Äúexposed‚Äù the way I think of her. She wrote a mediocre poem that doesn‚Äôt warrant the attention she received, and people are going over the top with praise for her solely because of her race. That‚Äôs racist, and you should work on yourself.
@Facts Over Feelings seems like you're the only one who thinks like that bud. you just exposed the way you think of her
Tagalog version: https://youtu.be/xZ3XrBKj5Q8
You are obviously a young ignoramus! This Afro-American is paying tribute to Biden, a bigot, who delivered the eulogy to a form member of the Ku Klux Klan Senator Robert C. Byrd!
@Dam Big Foot grow up
@Salty Gorilla I wish they would wear their own hair reason why we wear weave it‚Äôs easy to manage and quick not trying to be like white culture at all not long shot..I love my hair and I thank God i don‚Äôt have to worry about head lice in my hair.don‚Äôt be so offensive..my culture is beautiful we different take time and learn about African culture it‚Äôs magical ‚ú®üåô
@We got this Wow, apparently it doesn‚Äôt take much to impress you.
@Tina Marie if african ancestry is so "beautiful" then why do so many black women wear weaves and wigs? üòÇ Yeah shut up, and tell all the black women who do that to stop appropriating white culture lol
@Salty Gorilla so true! We shpuld replace her "cwacka ass" like we replaced Jake from state farm n everyone else
@this chicken bussin no you are actually üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@Suzanne McNeal - keep drinking the kool-aid
@Facts Over Feelings - and oprah has already taken her under her flabby wing
@Juan Garcia - up yours juan
@S955US84 Your mother
She's as phony as oprah
By the way it‚Äôs spelled *of course. Also, learn how to use ellipsis, your control over the English language is atrocious, regardless of what color you are.
@Wnrc LtvI WAS judging her based on her marvelous talent with poetry. No mention of color was ever made. But it bothers people like you when someone black is talented so you had to stick your big mouth in the conversation and act like it has anything to do with her skin color. She‚Äôs talented for a person of any color. You don‚Äôt know what my expectations are of black peoples It just makes you uncomfortable to see a talented black person so you want to project your racism onto others.
She make satanic ritual.
@LH SD It is really isn't about me. Who am I? I am not really in the equation at all. I just think she is very talented, and what a great speech. Plain and simple.
Is it the ooga booga African stuff on her head? She looks like a Ugandan not American
@Dorset Deb Peace?!! Surely you jest or maybe you were living in a cave these past years. No peace...
@Dorset Deb Troll! Move along. Anything you say is irrelevant!
@Juan Garcia of coarse..throw racism into the argumentüôÑ. I was only pointing out YOUR bigotry of low expectations, you have of black people... now that is what racism looks like.. You need to judge and treat people based on the content of their character instead of what they look like. Otherwise It's fake and racist.
@Wnrc Ltv No, it‚Äôs just that people like you can‚Äôt stand a black person being more intelligent than you. So you try to diminish them by suggesting they‚Äôre nothing special and are only being treated as such because they‚Äôre black. Its merely an unfortunate defense mechanism you use to compensate for your insecurities.
@Facts Over Feelings No one brought race into this EXCEPT YOU. You‚Äôre a bigot who can‚Äôt stand to see a young black girl accomplish more than you ever will. Her being ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù is commentary that is based solely on her oratory talent and nothing else.
@Facts Over Feelings I agree with you. These people get Star Struck when someone like Barack Obama completes a full sentence. It's almost as if they have no experience with black people other then the crap they watch on TV and YouTube.
Yeah she's a great speaker spewing mainstream media propaganda. Cliches Democrat political propaganda repeated ad nauseam the last four years. This is not original.
@Stef F If you appreciate Amanda you would have to specify for what? If it is her "poetry" that would only show you know nothing about poetry, as fewer and fewer people do. If you appreciate her for anything else from this video, then it would have to be her unobservant but twisted and degenerate view of the world. And that would make one a degenerate fool like her.
Facts Over Feelings So just what adjectives do you believe would be acceptable to describe one‚Äôs appreciation for Amanda Gorman?
"Captivating", to a fool!
@Salty Gorilla bruhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Captivating enchanting bewitching wait that‚Äôs evil!
@Facts Over Feelings just say you don‚Äôt understand the poem, it‚Äôs okay üòå
@ Facts Over Feelings The poem is actually good. And she is very good at public speaking as well
üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò
Stop it poor child here‚Äôs one more kiss üòò for you!!! You‚Äôll be okay!
That‚Äôs the African ancestors glowing on her...Beautiful‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

@Suzanne McNeal¬†ü§£üòÖ I hope everybody read this key word .'ON CALL'. It should be I AM WORKING from 5 to 8 cuz we got so many cases right? That proves you can't be too busy you still got energy to post here . AND POSTING ALL THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC? ü§£. And trust me you will never come near my mother.In my opinion You're not there to clean up the mess you are there to create it. simply because you do not understand anything about this virus or testing . So no people like you will not coming anywhere near my loved ones! The lawsuits against those hospitals neglet and treating patients improperly are piling up . Strange mainstream media does not report any of this including the severe damage this covid vaccine has already caused. Why are they quiet about it? You guys were doing better in making dance moves. AND No YOU keep drinking your Kool-Aid while YOU waiting for a phone call as you watch a pandemic on TEL-A-VISION.. That's why you just peeled out wishing me a nice day because you can't even begin to discuss the fraudulent testing for sars cov-19 and the fraudulent death tolls count. You was messing with the wrong girl here.Try again next time and don't forget the Kool-Aid ü§£

@Germangirl don't vote I'm a hospice nurse, not ICU. We're batting clean up in this horror show. I'm the on call. On from 5pm to 8am weekdays so our casemanagers get some rest. From 5pm on fridays to 8am Monday I cover them all. I'm the one you call at 3am when your mother takes a turn for the worse. I bought a car at the end of November. I've put 5000 miles on it doing my job. Dont tell me I'm not busy. Please take another sip of your koolaid and have a nice day.
@Facts Over Feelings These people. ü§£Keep telling the truth. They've been completely indoctrinated by mainstream media
@Suzanne McNeal retired ICU nurse here my former co-workers report no such thing . Including the ones in Europe. tired of people like you putting out a fake sob story just so everybody else can applaud you to make you feel good about yourself. And if you are really a hospice nurse I am concerned for the safety of your patients. How do you even have time to post things on YouTube we are in a middle of a so called ' pandemic' according to you people are dying left and right you should be getting your sleep if you are off work and probably you couldn't even get a full 8 hours .so how do you have time to post on YouTube in the middle of a pandemic? answer me this! In addition please explain to me what patients are dying from if the virus has scientifically been proven not to be isolated (exist.). Therefore what kind of treatments do those patients get? With that I ask myself are they dying of a so-called virus?or iotregenic causes( AKA death by medicine). you are aware 250,000 people die from iotregenic causes every year right? Your turn.
@Sea thank you üòâ
@Facts Over Feelings Not on any meds, as a nurse, though, I'm kind of worried that your arent taking yours as prescribed.
@Germangirl don't vote Hospice nurse here. So sick of seeing people deny this disease. Having loved ones dying on hospice directly because if this disease and still denying it. It's real, it's horrible and it searches out any physical weakness. What's yours?
@Mark Haunert Fr! People are mistaking true sincere compliments with toxic positivity and apparently racism. All were doing is stating facts that she's gorgeous, has a very calming voice, and as u said she was hand-picked! Some people really make me question our existence üòÇ.
@Mackenzie Miller exactly and thank you. I'm white and have made comments about her being so damn pretty. I've been scolded by at least 3 people for all kind of silly reasons. I don't know much about poetry but i understand that she won national awards and is a Harvard graduate. Not to mention mrs. Biden hand picked her. But her smoky sweet voice and stunning looks kept me watching. ‚úå
@Facts Over Feelings what‚Äôd you take from the poem? what do you think it was about?
@Mark Haunert What distortion? Lowering the standards for someone because of their race is, in fact, racism. Stop virtue signaling and learn to be truthful, even if it isn‚Äôt popular.
@Albin M And your point?
@Rebecca Harrison i agree with you on that comment. Sounds like a salty girl that's jealous of a drop dead beautiful woman. Hell i showed my wife to see how damn cute she is. Then the comment distorts it to you being the racist. Crazy people ‚úå
@Dorset Deb go cry somewhere else, Deb. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòäüíï
@Facts Over Feelings you take yourself more seriously than anyone else here, I'll tell you that
@Beaudy101 You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself. Just stop.
@Derek Spitz well I have to admit this girl reminded me of an episode in The Hunger Games dressed all nice giving a speech with a microphone. While we standing there hungry with holes in our clothes it was breathtaking creepy
@Last2Dollars You‚Äôve exposed yourself as the race-baiter you are, and you should learn what racism is before you throw the word around. You‚Äôre dismissed.
@Suzanne McNeal Take your meds.
@Abigail White "Breathtaking"? Oh do get a grip, Abigail.
@Rebecca Harrison Sorry but the truth is the truth. Personally I find this whole parade disgusting.Disgusting display of a parade.Instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the American people making everything seem glamorous while this Rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you . The Covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream. Enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red Hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way .ENJOY YOUR GLAMOROUS SHOW AMERICA
@Mussi93 Yeah I know. I like to dangle carrots to see how clever they think they are. Obviously, this one is just starting out.
@Facts Over Feelings I agree. I'm an English college lecturer and I teach a creative writing poetry module. I say this poem is ok but really nothing special. If the poem was read by a young white woman or a white man the reaction would have been very different. So on that basis, I have to conclude that the hysteria surrounding this reading is unauthentic and politically motivated. Sad really.
@Facts Over Feelings Lol. For a troll, you put some real effort in on that ü•ï, didn't you? Did you put the same effort in your handle...Facts over feelings? Yeah, yeah , got it... instead just spew feelings over facts. That'll spin em... Yawn. Not original. Not clever. Move along now.

@Facts Over Feelings Shes breathtaking because she wrote a poem like that. The poem leaves you speechless in its dignified, inarguable statement of truth. Her presentation unique, engrossing and lovely. Her words humbling in their truth yet she, humble in her recitation. Shes breathtaking because shes glorious and her light shines thru. Her waters run very deep. Positively glorious!
It hurts huh ??? üòò this will make you feel better..... here‚Äôs one more üòò
@Beaudy101 Just ignore the obvious troll.
@Facts Over Feelings Thank you, You will find almost the exact same fragmented, overly smooth, and self absorbed voice, along with the random hand signs at any modern poetry event. Shes good, but it was the political point of view that modern poets have that caused the event to have a poem laureate.
@Beaudy101 Because she is speaking of this person reciting her mediocre poem as if she‚Äôs created something timeless and amazing. It was a simple poem that any 7th grade student should be able to write. She‚Äôs only getting this attention because of the color of her skin, and everyone knows it. We should move beyond race hustling and start judging people based on merit.
@Facts Over Feelings Why do you assume anyone is expecting less? How and why do you come to that assumption with the words that were used by Abigail?
@LGBTQ all lives matter Lets fight against bullies uh.. ok??...
@Rebecca Harrison Yes, it sure does. It says that I don‚Äôt expect less from someone based on the color of their skin. You‚Äôre a racist, which is why my comment bothered you.
@Facts Over Feelings your comment says an awful lot about the kind of person you are than anyone else here ;)
@this chicken bussin I hear South Korea elections are safer than America's
Breathtaking? Why, because she‚Äôs black and can read a poem? Because she can use complete sentences? Seriously, do you really set the bar that low?

Just WOW!!! Wonderful words!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Victory in cheating? Huh, pretty sad how corrupted victory has become.
so eloquent, so poised.
"Let the globe, if nothing else say, this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried that will forever be tied together victorious." Grieved, hurt and tired? You live in the richest country in the world you entitled race-baiting Orwellian fool
Grief and hurt and tiredness... those are human experiences... has nothing to do with the country you live in...just part of understanding the realities of life... part of being a person. What's foolish about that?
If we merge Mercy with Might and Might with Right then LOVE becomes our Legacy and change our children's birth right
Not sure this was the intention but this reminded me of Lincoln's words that: "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it."
@Snore Lax loserrrr
@Snore Lax oh yeah, cause it‚Äôs conservatives that fought for human rights ü§£
Not with democrat run schools you won't. I have to sit back and watch this madness again.
The children of this country is in charge of our future. Raise them well and keep them educated so the next genration and so on could grow as people  shed love. A new year for America üá∫üá∏ and a better year for all.
Awesome!!
Watched this Live in Singapore along with millions around the world. Absolutely the most riveting five minutes I have had the privilege to witness. If I closed my eyes, I swore I heard MLK speaking through her at times.
Wow. ‚ù§
Wow! Wonderful üëçüèºüíïüåü
Very encouraging to read these positive comments. I love these words and the delivery, beautiful.
scripture? that's just for christians. not worth unifying under that
The people who dislike this are sick minded
Ehh, excuse me???
I lives in brazil, but this poem inspired me, I never heard anything so inspiring.
Wow!

Who 1 like on this comment= 1 more motivation for blm and lgbtq  pride
Fun Fact: She is 22 years old.
@Maxine Lamont ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Maxine Lamont of you have to ask...
@Salty Gorilla ok then, since I didn't understand your comment, please do tell what you really think about the poem and the poet
@ClawedOrb55 don't be so triggered little girl üòÇ
@Giulia C. You sure do like to project your own assumptions onto my comment, I guess you missed the question mark üòÜ I'm questioning on what basis other than her speaking ability is she receiving such a large amount of praise.
@Salty Gorilla you said that the only good thing about her is how she talks and you compared her to Hitler
@Giulia C. When did I say that she is bad? üòÜ
@Salty Gorilla no, she's also being praised for the message that she's conveying. She doesn't encourage war, vilence, discrimination. She's an amazing poet. Martin Luther King was a great speaker, Gandhi was a great speaker. It's not like someone is necessarily bad just because they speak wellüòÇ
@Giulia C. They're both being praised simply for being good speakers. That's the similarity, pay attention
@ClawedOrb55 I said nobody asked, didn't say anything about caring. Also, it must take forever for you type when you capitalize the first letter in every word üòÜ
@Maxine Lamont you're missing the point
@RE -O on the one hand you're right he's craving the attention on the other hand I'm having fun üòÜ
@Maxine Lamont by the way you haven't put a single fact on the table get an education will you? How the heck could your grandmother pass away from a virus that has been scientifically proven to exist what kind of doctors are you going to? Wow. I would love to sit down and have a talk with this doc.Unbelievable .
@Maxine Lamont after I'm done with you you will be the embarrassed one I'm calling you out I hear you talkin you not saying anything. Mainstream media will also push your vaccine down our throat 24/7 same they got¬† caught Staging scenes below So people will blindly follow what others do https://youtu.be/dEXb1ZGJL84 No Demand on vaccine no production. Simple. The only pandemic I see is on Television! YOU Our mainstream media became the enemy to the people of this land and at some point it will be held accountable .I hope everybody is aware these media lies are an act of treason that¬† caused a lot of lives .And why are you guys not talking about That Mr.Drosten, the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have been sued¬† for crimes¬† against Humanity as of 2 weeks ago https://rumble.com/vbjefu-money-talks-law-suit-in-germany-eng..html https://youtu.be/JJFCTOMfsxw
@fisher king I'm interracial ü§£üòÖ. Wow
@RE -O I'm sorry but I could have done that crap with my eyes closed but that's just me. Plus I speak up for my Americans and all people on this earth not for corrupt politicians who enrich themselves while make others suffer
@Apollo The Moon Man ur mad she‚Äôs making historyüòøüòøüòø
@Salty Gorilla how can you compere a 22 year-old poet who is trying to spread the wolrd of democracy with Hitler? In wich universe is that even remotely possible?
@fisher king don‚Äôt feed him. He‚Äôs just insecure that he‚Äôs in 40  and still living in his mom‚Äôs basement meanwhile a 22-year old woman is having a day of her life.
@Germangirl don't vote ok if that‚Äôs what you think. I think she‚Äôs an amazing and beautiful accomplished woman. It takes guts to express political sentiment in front of million people.
@RE -O hush baby. I am 52 and nowhere as accomplished. You have 30 more years to either be me or her.
so... should a 22 year old be talking about life like that? lol she barely lived
I know she is an idiot. Most of her so called poem was she plagiarized. Research it!
@RE -O lolüòÇ
@Germangirl don't vote oh dear all this happened and that's your excuse for being racist then you'd better get back to your fox news so you can consume some more nonsense
@Princess of Keys I'm sorry but whoever that was on state is not the best of society in my opinion I believe she has been heavily groomed. The average honest hardworking labor person working at McDonald's trying to make it deserve my full respect
@ClawedOrb55 waiting
@Dannilicious because I can gotta problem üñï
@ClawedOrb55 no insult put facts on the table. You going to have to put on your big boy panties
@fisher king if this whole parade including the outfit Etc does not show you that this girl has been groomed and indoctrinated from a young age then I don't know what it takes to convince you. Besides this is not about black and white this is about rich and poor.Open your eyes America. All these politicians and governors are up there eating filet mignon and caviar sitting in mansions (still getting payed like average 150000 to 200000 aprox).while the average business owner is not allowed to keep his shop open to put food on his family's table? We at the bottom fighting for toilet paper and they up there in glamorous clothing having speeches music and poems. I don't know if you vote but the reason I stopped is because we are voting for one bird of prey with two Wings they go behind the curtains at split the money. cooperations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have been using mainstream media and politicians to enrich themselves even more don't you see that. Why is mainstream media not talking about the World Health Organization Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is right now being sued for crimes against humanity for all of this .why don't they shove that down our throat 24/7 ?But No they talk about vaccine all day long our nation have been indoctrinated by mainstream media since World War 1 time for people like you to wake up because this is not going to get better if you don't do your own research.
@Germangirl don't vote yeah growing up in the USA as a black girl really spoils you
@fisher king yep
@Betty Boop yeah let's all hold hands and sing kumbaya while young men still are being slaughtered
@Maxine Lamont Impressive? ¬†@Â§ÆÁ§º¬† this girl has been groomed(spoiled) from childhood.Disgusting display of a parade.Instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the American people making everything seem glamorous while this Rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you .

@Sasuke bestie ¬†@Â§ÆÁ§º¬† this girl has been groomed(spoiled) from childhood on you maybe didn't have that advantage so don't feel bad
@RE -O this girl has been groomed(spoiled) from childhood on you maybe didn't have that advantage so don't feel bad
@Tattoo Soda I don't know but this girl has definitely been groomed from childhood on you maybe didn't have that advantage.
@Tattoo Soda don't worry everyone lives their loves differently, no need to feel like you have to be the best of the best in society at all.
@Sonic the Hedgehog if you don't care then why tf are you replying?? Smh
Fun fact Nobody cares
@fisher king This constant hammering on race and a slavery that was ended at the cost of thousand of American young men's lives 150 years ago is incredibly divisive.
@Stanzavik bc u asked a question. Dahhh
@Dannilicious Why are you replying?
I thought she was 12. She can't be 22.
Fun fact she is a horrible speaker
@Salty Gorilla right
@Stanzavik Why are you commenting?
Why is that fun?
Biden touching girls compilation
@Salty Gorilla hitler speeched about hate and division not hope and inspiration
@Salty Gorilla jfc Hitler?? Really dude? Just go away. Your negativity isn‚Äôt welcome here.
fun fact she is actually 23 *
Looking every bit of 12
@Salty Gorilla name checks out, salty af üíÄ
@Maxine Lamont she's a very enthusiastic speaker, yes. Other than that.... ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è All this praise of her over a speech is reminiscent of Hitler being praised simply for delivering powerful speeches ü§î
@cumbiambero I don't recall mentioning Trump
@Salty Gorilla fun fact: trump lost loser
@RE -O am 19 and same
yes same age as the woman who stole Pelosi's laptop
I am also 22 but I am nowhere as accomplished as she is üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
It's a fun fact but you got me thinking I'm 31 !! What have I done with my life !!
Fun fact: nobody asked
Even more fun for facts is that she is also the first youngest poet laureate.
"We seek harm to none" good line let see how long will take for Boden to drone and bomb some midle east or African Nation
That was awesome!
If we could just have more young people like that young lady I had to hear it one more time!! Very Special
I can't help thinking how beautifully her hands move with her words ... compared to the ugliness of the outgoing President's hands and words.
Prophetic words. She sure made history today!!
What a beautiful young woman.....and I don't mean just her appearance.
‚ÄúIf we emerge mercy with the might ( Lord Jesus) and the might with right then love become our legacy .‚Äùit‚Äôs a very powerful line folks ...
Amenüôèüèæ
Brava.
With young people like this, you know America will have a bright future.
Wow! I don't know her, but I am so proud of her.
This is the Epitome of Excellence! I thank God for the Gift that he's given her. Amen.
This I enjoyed most of all today..
'For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it'. More powerful and true than many of those political speeches. And applies and appeals to all the Nations of the World and their People.
WOW! This is the next Maya Angelou.
"Inspiringüëèüëèüëè America üá∫üá∏ UNITED WE STAND" Nothing Is Impossible" California Proud Of Her üôåüôåüôå
us kids have witnessed so much history this year, wait till our kids ask about 2020 TvT
Astonishing! Young woman your poem moved me.
Astonishing!!!
It's all the way live!!!!!
This Young Lady, Amanda Gordon....Is Not Only an Amazing Poet/Orator. She is a Havard Graduate at the age of 22 years old. *This Young Lady "COMMANDED" this stage... WOW!!
That young girl- an adolescent activist-  her moralizing poem... such a clich√©, such a copy, so obviously influenced.
She's a part of this historic moment. A moment for women, a moment for people of color, for america as a whole. She is now a part of our history and a part of the history President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are paving
@JUJULIAN Trumper logic: ignore or discredit entire arguments saying that Biden won and cherry pick the ones that make you look morally superior
@JUJULIAN My man, I have yet to find a single valid argument on why the whole election is a joke. If you find one please tell me
@Avett riiiight cause every single court denying every single case isn't fishy at all. Or how Supreme Court denied the Texas case isn't fishy either...
@Matt Lee Democrat logic: ignore or discredit entire arguments and cherry pick the ones that make you look morally superior
‚Äã@JUJULIAN Trump supporters' only argument: 'wake up sheep'
@Avett THANK YOU
Dang the amount of trolls and jerks in this reply section is... unbelievable. The election was never stolen. #GetOverIt
@Meagan Wilson I'm not in denial. I know perfectly well that this election was stolen, you on the other hand are a sheep that sees only that fits your twisted narrative. I pity you. You are a willing particpant to tyranny and you don't even know it. So sad.
@freeclimb aww sweetie you lost, its time to move past the first stage of grief. Denial isnt healthy for you ü§£
@Avett You wouldn't have a clue as to what "Trumpie" feels. Because you're a closed minded fascist that belives in censorship and destroying those that think differently from you. So you project how you reacted the last 4 years to Trump on to others because it's all you know. You should work on that.
Great, she's apart of the first historically stolen election in U.S. history. Yeah, great thing to be part of. Smh
@Avett Well, then is OK. The poem is misery as this moment of the history is, you will see soon.
Look like this is the moment when you are not clever enough...
@Keletso Rosenberg You're entitled to your opinion, however i'm entitled to have an opinion on your opinion and so forth.
@Keletso Rosenberg Ok then what makes you such a great judge of poems?
@Hyuuga Kro You ignore the historical significance of people of color speaking. Yes it wouldn't be as historical because white people dont have a history of being oppressed and silenced. If anyone is diminishing history here, it's you
I bet if same poem was given by a white female, it would have not been much of a big deal to all these people. Do not diminish history of any country with such poems, they are amusing and creative at best.
@Kaila Hodge-McNutt tbh I think he's right, good poem but not history like illmatic ;), but yeah se the youngest so technically it's history until some other person that is younger does it
@Keletso Rosenberg jealous I see
Someone will do a report for high school history class in 30 years and they will read this speech. This WILL live on. This IS history in the making.
@Keletso Rosenberg Let's see your poems.
@Snore Lax yeah you just snore on
@JUJULIAN people were laughing for four years now they stand still and realise that not all americans are idiots
@JUJULIAN hahaha so true
Yeah the very first blatant theft of the election. Praise democracy! Praise the democrats!
She's of this historic moment, not just a part of it. If one is simply a part of something, there are lines of separation, whereas being of the moment, indicates unity!
@JUJULIAN Only sick, and deranged minds are laughing at this moment.
Was to me. This poem reminds me of everything that happened to get here and what happened today. :)
@JUJULIAN awww look, another Trumpie who‚Äôs feelings were hurt! It‚Äôs okay, just sit down and be quiet. This is absolutely making GOOD history.
This isn't historic at all and people are laughing at this whole thing wake tf up
Stunning. Light, brave enough to see it, brave enough to be it. Wow, just wow. Amanda Gorman YOU are inspirational. Thank you for being who you are.
Nice haiku
Yay! Now lets give her a 150k a year job in the Federal Goverment!!! YAYAYAY!!!
Beautifully done
I don‚Äôt get the need for these poets. They are so boring.
She is .... I‚Äôm speechless !! I could listen to her for hours ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Beautiful young woman , her words flow like satin ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
I think my patriotism grew ten times after listening to this speech!
Amanda Gorman's poem is sublime.
üëè Congrats for your Appointment as our 1st Poet and thank you for your heartfelt poem. We are proud to be graced with your words today and look forward to many more. I truly hope those words began to move hardened, misled hearts as well!üíôüò∑üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Amen Our Sister
The people who put a thumbs down must be Trump supporters :/ This woman is amazing and she deserves an award for this!
"Lay down arms"
This is what u call hope!
Simply wonderful
"the new dawn blooms as we free it"
Well done
pretty.... How does this put money in people's pockets so they can pay their bills?
Such an American comment.
She made me cry. God bless her.
Hundreds of affidavits, video, audio, admissions. Sick
Stop quoting what she said and then saying ‚Äúdamn‚Äù. We have ears, we can listen
Pac couldn't have said it better. Tip of the Cap
Best antidote against trumpian stupidity  hate. Bravo!
We need the Infinity Stone's to snap away the last 4 year's of Trump's Presidency. But...it's time to look forward and move on to a better tomorrow.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
She stole the whole show. Made everyone else look amateur.
Exactly!
@Boop The Nose no, why?
@Natascha Robles Funny thing- "5 deferment Asthma, draft dodging Joe" never exhibited nor talked about a stutter in 47 years of grifting- only when dementia set in...
@Secret Oktober78 you having a stroke?
@notlkk And if he wrote a poem in the vein of Wordsworth or Keats or Browning, you'd acknowledge same, right? Don't make me laugh!
@Natascha Robles oh wow, if you read your comment really carefully, you can see a little jealously towards the end. Amazing.
Hi all I listen it is beautiful but if you listen you can hear a little stuttering at the part where she said it's deception

@Joel Lambert The dems are nothing without identity politics- they will never see Dr. Kings vision as the are to blinded by racial division and led by race hustlers like Sharpton. Ironic the Old "5 dementia Joe" got elected considering his racist past - of he were a Republican he would have been tossed into the ash heap
@konjotora Don't you mean "5 deferment Asthma Joe"? Harris is VP
@Julius Seizure I mean there's a reason we aren't talking about Lady Gaga or funny hat man or poet laureates before her. Classless inbreds wouldn't understand.
FOOL, that's what u are
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL not

@konjotora She got into Harvard through affirmative action.
@konjotora Unless it's White heritage. Being proud of White heritage is evil. Biden admin will prosecute anyone White positive.

And injected and injected and injected or no work enjoy when the permanent disabilities kick which strangely mainstream media never talks about not even back then with the swine flu I guess those type of stories get pulled huh ?THIS is the America you want .BRAVO üëè

Trust the top comment to be a fkn put-down disguised as a compliment.
@Secret Oktober78 Don¬¥t fall for Trumps lies. Its been part of his narative all along that people should believe him and not science or journalists except if they follow his game
@Mr. Meerkat People also take my figurative speaking literally
@Julius Seizure You said she was 14 years old.
@Julius Seizure She is 22 yrs old, went to college and writes at a 6th grade level!
@Julius Seizure but shes "POC" so we have to act like it's astounding and amazing or else you're a nazi
Not hard in a crowd full of Democrat pedophiles
you know what her speech had? Youthful ambitions.
@Julius Seizure Like I said, write a poem and let us see how good you are. All talk. Just like your Trump.
That's so funny ....but It's true @ the same time!
@Secret Oktober78 Terrible comment.
@Eevee my beloved It's super overrated. Billie Eillish sweeping the Grammy's in a nutshell. Which was rigged. See the parallels? Too much pretentiousness for me. I don't mean to disturb your illusion that everything is gonna be okay.
@Julius Seizure excuse me but, why? Mind explaining what you hate about what she wrote/read aloud?
‚Äã@notlkk There wasn't JUSTICE, but it was JUST US. Corny puns that were overused. Takes a little to impress y'all don't it? Spoken words that ring true just because of the color of her skin. What does token even mean?
@Angel 1973 You're a lot more fractured and not as strong as you think. And it's not what I see on the news. Where do you think I live?
@Julius Seizure we maybe fractured, but we are NOT weak..believe that, and we are more together than what you see on the news.
@Julius Seizure Why don't you write something for us to critique? Let's see what level you're on. My bet is below 9th.
@konjotora You think a unified US is the only hope against Communist China? That's adorable. US couldn't even defend 400,000 Americans from an accidental pandemic. And Russia was able to fill the US with domestic terrorist. US will never be unified. Not to mention the US's own healthcare, education, and justice system being used against them. If it's not anti-vax, school shootings, opiate epidemic, etc; it's something new.
@Julius Seizure You‚Äôre never written a single sentence in your life that anyone would ever want to read. Nice try at racism though. F off.
@Secret Oktober78 That election is over and one for history to reveal to us in time. For now, let‚Äôs focus on CHINA and giving Kamala a chance. She‚Äôs young and in her prime.
@Julius Seizure I think she‚Äôs 22 and a Harvard grad. Her confidence to speak at such an event is amazing.
@only1rb This is the future of the America I want. Knowledgeable, proud of their unique heritage and wanting EVERYONE to have a seat at the table going forward. A truly unified USA is something the whole world needs and is the only hope against communist Chinese rule.
@Mr. Meerkat She writes at a 9th grade level.
yeah including the new president
@Julius Seizure *22
PERIODTTTTTT
She's 14 and this is deep.
@konjotora It‚Äôs more people than that - votes were changed, stolen election- oh well, she did deliver a beautiful poem! She might lose points on the left with her name- not ethnic enough.
@konkyolife I said the same thing. She was on üî•!!
@Abu Lahab she just confidently offered an olive branch to 75,000,000 people in good faith and sincerity. Perhaps she should be VP next time.
We need another Meryl Streep, don‚Äôt we!?
"for there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it, if only we're brave enough to be it" WOW
Unbelievably honest and raw. But hope is what we bring forward
They made all these new rules about staying inside "for our safety" today. Fortunately, most GOPers know it's a lie to cover up the fact that barely 100 "fans" showed up to cheer on their president. Trump 2024 (at this point I'll take Don Jr. or Ivanka) Thank you Father and in His name we pray! Amen
After a long time of being ashamed of things our country has spoken into the world, I feel patriotic once again 3
Shakespeare turning in his grave.
I could listen to Amanda Gorman speak all day long. She makes me feel good to be part of the human race. I'm not American, but these words resonate just as strongly, I think, no matter where you live.
OMG, lost for words. Totally incredible beautiful, and talented young lady. I have no doubt she will have a wonderful future and a positive impact on the world we live in. üòÅüíï
On the shoulders of our children shall our democracy flourish for all.
Oh Lord!!! Drama much??? She looked like she was conducting an orchestra instead of reading a poem
I fell in love with poetry again ‚ù§
Dont say "we need more people like her" ... Say "I need to be like her" ...
@Germangirl don't vote You are. You silly person.
@unclebobunclebob I just sent you what the CDC reported at the World Health Organization on the existence of this virus. As we all can see here it looks like you are using mainstream media is your only source information to falsley believe we are in a pandemic so who is delusional üôÑ ü§£.
@unclebobunclebob I gave you facts give me facts prove me wrong no insults grow up remember wear your big boy Big Boy panties.
@Germangirl don't vote lot of "facts"...lot of delusion, it seems
3) The test that is used for this virus¬† is called a RT¬† PCR ( poly chain morase reaction )test. This test run over 35 threshold Cycles will trigger anything as positive meaning if you have a flu you name or any other coronavirus(we have more than one)and you got millions of them in your body¬† will trigger positive to 80%. World Health Organization AKA mr. Dr.Drosten( supposably after Consulting with (WELL PAYED üí∞)virologist epidemiologist globally recommended this test to be run at 45 threshold cycles will trigger and 89 to 94% false positives. Your experts especially Faucy is very well aware of this üëå. And then the accounting anybody that dies WITH Covid(aka any virus) dying OF Covid see below (apprx.2 min) https://youtu.be/Tw9Ci2PZKZg there¬† you got your 300,000 fatalities . Since the virus has not been isolated they have to use characterized stocks meaning something that may carry the character nucleotides of the virus. THIS IS NOT MEDICINE THIS IS FRAUD . Just a little critical thought .
Well I gave you enough time to respond I figured you was going to run. Germany we say dogs that bark don't bite.üòè that's okay I still can speak my peace.

@Germangirl don't vote Let's just keep up the crazy. Huh? I know you're doing YOUR part. The rest of us will catch up later.
And you right my world is crazy but not anywhere near as crazy as yours. I would not get my information from mainstream media(globally) . Research who is funding them(Globally).The bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefellers would be a good place to start .I can back up my claim if you want with links to the World Health Organization and cdc regarding this issues.
@unclebobunclebob you're ignorant behavior is killing people whether you know it or not. More and more people waking up you might be one of them obviously you need a friend because you talking to me. I gave you plenty of numbers in my earlier post to work with .In addition. I'm giving you this.

@Germangirl don't vote What more do you want me to say? I'm trying to agree with your crazy statements. Don't you need friends in your pitiful outlook?
@Spyder well then you could have said it just like that you can still change your comment appreciate your honesty. at least you got some Integrity a lot of others do not admit mistakes and that's what America is all about.
@Germangirl don't vote I understand what you are saying. I'm not saying to wear what she is wearing, or talk like she is talking. All I'm saying is that you should be positively influencing people around you, it doesnt matter how you do it.
@Spyder when Americans behave like true Americans again .I can stop. You know it is wrong there are teenagers or young woman in here reading this and somebody is telling them they should be like somebody else come on now. I have an issue with that. Some young woman cannot achieve these looks or afford expensive clothes or can not read that well and they will try their whole life to be like somebody else or perfect picture Model from a magazine? . It's sad.
@Stephen Hatt ur name is Stephan
@Germangirl don't vote stop. pls just stop.
This is a horrible statement there are plenty of children out there that are talented that have their own individual personality. They do not need to be like anybody else. so what are you telling handicapped children who are trying and trying and never achieve that. that they are worthless because they don't look or talk like her? Wow. WELL TO ANYBODY THAT READ THIS .BE YOURSELF AND PROUD YOU NEVER NEED TO BE LIKE ANYONE ELSE YOU ARE SPECIAL JUST THE WAY YOU ARE!!
Wise words!
@unclebobunclebob so you open your mouth and then run away huh typical this is why this country is in this mess that is in. Should be ashamed of yourself
@unclebobunclebob sickening the height of your insanity absolutely disgusting
@Germangirl don't vote Yep. There's NO pandemic. Nobody has died yet anywhere in the world. As a matter of fact, people are starting to come out of their graves. Yeah. That's it. THAT'S the ticket.
@Tasneem Alizerig you're right it is not funny nobody should say you should be like somebody else. I don't wan't to like anybody else . So what would you teach(tell) your children you want to be like somebody else ? really? are you serious?besides Disgusting display of a parade.Instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the American people making everything seem glamorous while this Rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you .

Can one poet and one poem undo the outrage that was January 6, 2021? My sources say yes. Bravo Amanda Gorman!!!
This is not her own words...You will see. But she can act.
I just can't find the perfect words to describe this moment. It's beyond words, it's unique.

Thank you! I can feel it tho! I hope we can get back to being there for you World

Heavily guarded inauguration, ‚Äúspectators other than a handful are not allowed.‚Äù The miasma of secrecy and distrust makes me think of Beijing after the Tiananmen Square Incident, where the important issues were swept under the rug and may never see the light. But this girl is indeed inspirational. Should we all appreciate in this country the opportunities we have had, the freedom we have enjoyed, the courage we can feel, the dreams we can dream of?
Beautiful!!!
From Amanda Gorman's 22 years old bronze pounded chest; the historical recitation of her inaguration poem: THE HILL WE CLIMB When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea. We must wade. We've graved the belly of the beast. We've learned that quiet isn't always peace. In the norms and notions of what just is, isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and the time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country, committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man. And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else say, this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried that will forever be tied together victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made. That is the promise to glade the hill we climb. If only we dare it's because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It's the past we step into and how we repair it. We've seen a force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded, but while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated in this truth. In this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it in its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter. To offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be a country that is bruised. But whole benevolence, but bold, fierce, and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blenders become their burdens, but one thing is certain. If we merged mercy with the mights into might with right, a night then love becomes our legacy, and change our children's birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than one. We were left with every breath, my bronze pounded chest. We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold limbed hills of the West. We will rise from the wind swept to Northeast where our forefathers first realized the revolution. We will rise from the lake when cities of the middle Western States. We will arise from the sun baked South. We will rebuild, reconciled and recover and every known nook over a nation And every corner called our country. Our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid, the new dawn balloons, as we free it. For there was always light. If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.
Decently summarized one nation.
1 over 10 thumbs down to this. It is sad but the reality and the reason why speeches like this exist.
The best part of the show. She nailed it 100 percent. She is the future we hope. America should be proud
Not my president this guy is a communist and he stole the election
Great
Well said,
She sais she is just a girl with a black skin. Is true, but her soul is so pure, her mind is so bright and her spirit is so amazing. She is simply the amazing American light of hope and trust in a beautiful future. Lovely poem, amazing attitude!

I have no clue what she said. But sure ....lets all stand anyhow.
Beautiful üòç
It has been a while since meaningfull words like these have been spoken here...humbling
PRESIDENT TRUMP did an EXCELLENT JOB FOR ALL AMERICANS ! U TOO SWEETIE !
America's funeral was today. Truth be told, it died long before this. Today was but a formality. It was inevitable that America should pass eventually, but many Americans will be shaken despite warnings from both the bible and their own experience. Too many have listened to false-hope-selling-hucksters. Stop listening to them. Heaven and earth shall pass away but Jesus' words abide forever. God never promised to preserve America, and it is frankly long overdue for judgment. This country forsook its God many years ago. Apart from the obvious abominations, American churchianity as a whole has long been a stench in the nostrils of God. American Christendom has largely honored God with their mouths while having hearts far from Him. We are certainly entering a dark time, and in all likelihood we are entering a prophetic time. May this shaking cause those who were looking to something or someone else for hope, to repent of their idolatry and hope solely on Jesus Christ and His promises. For those who are truly following and hoping in Christ already, may they be encouraged that our Lord has gone before us. In the world we were promised tribulation, but be of good cheer; Jesus has overcome the world (John 16:33). The floodplain of the Jordan, as it were, may be upon us. Be ready to contend with horses (Jeremiah 12:5). When communication is confused and stifled from haters of God in big tech, know that God always hears and His arm cannot be shortened. When your earthly liberties are uprooted completely so that you appear to be dwelling in an unrecognizable place, know that liberty in Christ is all that ever mattered and Jesus and His Father promised to make their home with us (John 14:23). We are pilgrims on this earth just passing through to the Celestial city. While in chains at midnight, Paul and Silas sang hymns to the Lord their God while the prisoners listened to them. Why? If the Son makes you free, you are free indeed (John 8:36). True liberty was never purchased on parchment in 1776; True liberty was purchased on a cursed tree nearly 2,000 years ago. Many men died to purchase some earthly liberties for several generations here on earth, for which we are no doubt grateful, but only one Man was worthy and willing to die for the sins of mankind to purchase souls for all eternity. What can compare to this amazing grace? You may take my country and even take my life, but you can never take my Jesus from me. While we enjoyed many liberties in a land of plenty, those things that can be shaken will be, so that the things which cannot be shaken will remain. May the Lord's will be done. While it is sad to see what has become of a once God-fearing nation (in many ways), it is good if the Lord sees fit, to let it all crumble that we might know that He alone is God and the He alone liberates captives. Our outward freedom was never promised on this earth. But our eternal freedom was promised and secured by Jesus Christ Himself, which thing no man can deprive you of. We have the same task today as we had yesterday, which is to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Men can separate us from our families, our friends, our liberties on earth and even our lives.... but who can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:37-38)? Maranatha! Credit Serves Christ
Thank you Amanda for raising the baton of hope.
This is a sad but glorious moment of our Republic to rally from despair to hope and understanding of what it is to be a Democracy. What we endured wasn't politics it was nothing more than fear motivation and manipulation of the minds of ill informed participants of a failed regime. We have the opportunity to heal and move on to make this Nation greater than ever before.
Will we ever stop talking about slavery? Ever ? Doubt it.
I liked that
ok, we get it, just put your hand down already

We arent purposed to allowing all cultures lmao we have made korean, japanese, communist camps. we make torture camps in the middle east, we randomly grab civilians in isreal and bring to camps just to torture them lol IDK where she getting her info from but she is stuck in bubble
I too love propoganda
This is inspiration Amazing . She says it all . Please God we can all move on .
Love her voice, her eloquent gestures, and her words...oh my, I'm speechless...
I cried at this one's Brilliance! WOW
Wow!
2:12 - "Victorious not because we will never again know defeat, But because we will never again sow division." I'm in tears. This is brilliant.
Her hand gestures are ridiculous and tacky. She's way too young to have anything deep to say.
Horrible
What a beautiful young lady !
Most of us came to know Maya Angelou late in her life. Watching Amanda Gorman is what Maya Angelou might of looked like when she was 22. Great speech and delivery.

Magnificent
Phillis Wheatley reborn? Just so beautiful, profound, and moving.
This recital will be one for the history books. So good!
very beautiful
Why does the American left claim to love their nation, while sharing exactly 0 of the beliefs held by the free white men who started it? True Americans my ass.
@Niall_994 you fundamentalists are absolutely insane. If we still went by their rules African Americans would be enslaved, women would lose almost all their rights, poc would be legally oppressed, the country would have way less civil liberties. The country and people in it are what makes up America not some old dead people who haven't ever seen a phone
@Memphis Stef The nation is theirs, they define it and if you don't follow their views and beliefs then you are not a part of that nation, you just live in its area.
@Memphis Stef I take the view that was taken by the men responsible for the USA existing.
You have a demented view of what actually being an American is.
Beautiful in all ways!
Just gorgeous. What a beautiful experience to watch this young prophet speak. Thank you, Amanda Gorman.
In 7min she was more brightly accurate than 4 distant regrettable years with trump
Wow.. beautiful!
Such a talented woman! A poem so powerful in content, so passionately delivered! The US's first poet Laureate and such a VERY good choice!
So basically the truth is now known and all is forgiven. So past mistakes are laid to rest. So America isn't now going to war all the deciet and lies twisted like a vine by the sun news and others. All the conspiracies carry on causing fear and upset...The new fear we are over populated at 8 billion...I accept all from Laureate yet wool is been placed over the general publics eyes. Many fear for our futures and children still many lay in poverty! Globally!
Amanda Gorman is 23 years old. I am so happy to live in a society that includes people like her who can use words with such power and emotion. It's impressive, and inspiring.
POWERFULLLLLLLLLL
I've heard her three times and I still get goosebumps. This young lady will go far - and be heard far and wide!
She is amazing
Amazing
Nice little ditty. Too bad the party that claims political opponents are domestic terrorists puts a shame to her words. Unity? Healing? LMAO
SO GOOD! I want to listen to it over and over again.
Best part of the whole inauguration
One young star has put all politicians and the world in a humble shade!! A shade we only can leave by embracing love,nature and its sun again!! Thanks, Amanda, for being a beautiful and honest sunlight!!
Outstanding, Ms. Gorman.
God bless everyone . We have a new beginning starting today let‚Äôs all come together and build back stronger,better, and healthier then ever !
This was amazing
Awsome

You know is bad when they use you ONLY because you're black..
@Juan Valdez You're disregarding her talent lmfao thats not an opinion
@Cencres So, I can't have an opinion?
they chose her cause shes talented tf is ur problem
Forgive me, I‚Äôm British but did anything remotely moving or more uplifting come out of the gob of Ivanka?(Melania is barely literate). As for Don Jnr , (first class wanker) as we say in England.
Correct quote " our blunder becomes their burden". Thank you Amanda for this emphasis. America is now burdened by Trump mess.
I am highly impressed, I hear you, your words reached me!

I agree! Lets censor everyone!
Every American needs to watch this when they loose hope !!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô
She was great !!!
Wow üò≥ beautiful
Beautiful. What a wonderful poem and reading.
WAS THAT A HAMILTON REFERENCE
To the people who disliked this: why?
@Sc Parker no. She was vilifying racism. People can change, whereas racism is evil.
Because underneath her flowery idealistic language she slipped in the vilification of 75 Million Americans. "We‚Äôve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy." She and her ilk dont want to build bridges, they want as she says to merge "might with right" use their power to decide what is right.
Best moment. However 0:58‚Äì1:11 is basically a ripoff from Obama's speech.
@Nate Mattingly Agreed Nate. That‚Äôs the euphemistic standpoint. Middle ground could be homage.
There's a literary term for that and its called allusion
Ora chiudete gli occhi, ed immaginate che il discorso lo abbia pronunciato Donald Trump! Non ce la fate, vero?
I liked the bit where she rhymed "it" with "it".
This gives me so much hope!
‚ÄúThere is always a light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.‚Äù
Impressive
15,000 people rightly were in awe of this amazing young woman.....1 and a half thousand asshats gave it a thumbs down.....speaks volumes....guess who they were....
To Amanda ~ Here was magical genius, inspired and bold, moving on the future, a golden light, foretold.
Bad president and ugly vice president
Ugly inside for sure
The last sentence was dangggg
Damn!!! This is what u call a poem. Amazing!
"a time where a skinny black girl decadent from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becomig president only to find herself reciting for one" CHILLS I LOVE HER

Transcript: "When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry. A sea we must wade. We braved the belly of the beast. We‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace, and the norms and notions of what ‚Äújust‚Äù is isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried. That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promised glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare. It‚Äôs because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour. But within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So, while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain. If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the West. We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover, And every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid. The new dawn balloons as we free it. For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it."

Biden/Harris = Broken and Token
yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!
That's quite the profound speech to her Master Joe as she speaks on behalf of her Democrat Party Plantation establishment that has dominantly and consistently prevented her race from making more forward progress.
Maya Angelou would be very proud of this young poet.
"There is always light if we are brave enough to see it. If we are brave enough to BE it." - Amanda Gorman
Her content and delivery were brilliant, she spoke truths in such an inspiring way. Beautiful inside and out .
Just an FYI - this is NOT a poem. She was merely giving a speech.
Just an FYI - you're incorrect.
OVER 40 MILLION EXTRA PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN? A MAN WHO CANT GET A THOUSAND LIKES ON YOUTUBE AND EVERYBODY HATES SO MUCH THAT THEY HAVE TO BLOCK HIM OFF???COME ON MAN!!JOE YOU CHEATED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No proof so keep it moving trump is gone but maybe he will have another tv for you too watch
Even as we grieve we grow Even as we hurt we hope Even as we tire we tried That we will forever be tied together victorious Not because we will never again know defeat But because we will never again sow division. That hit me deep in my spirit. Your words holds healing and power young lady. Thank you! God bless you and God bless America!
Blessings upon her so wonderful
Did anyone notice that this "poem" is just a normal speech with a vocal affectation?
No, because it was a poem. What, you wanted a limerick?
Absolutely amazing
Please friends, don't feed the trolls just yet, Just sit back and enjoy yourselves a bit, it's been a long 4 years. One thing is certain, there is no cure for stupidity, so don't even bother.
Absolutely. I feel that if Trump's bad behavior, along with his worshippers, hadn't received so much attention from the press and on social media, this monster wouldn't have reached the extreme level it has.
There is definitely cure for stupidity, heck I still think I'm stupid but I KNOW that I'm still need to learn to improve but there is no cure for ignorance tho. Some ppl just refuse to move forward or better themselves doesn't matter how much effort went into showing them a better way.
You said it! It has been a long four years.
Nothing about God in this poem. What a shamble our country is in to not recognize our creator
#Awesome! So good I watched this video three times. Proud of our natural beautiful young lady.‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
A poem recited with a dignity and purpose that shames the passing ex-president and his divisive bigotry and hatred.
Impressive !
Thunderous applause!!!!

Yes, indeed let's all be the light!
I'm black, and don't care.

That was incredible!
Young version of Michelle Obama... I love her
Congratulations America! loads of love from Denmark ‚ù§Ô∏è
At 2:48 the woman scrolling on her phone made me roll my eyes. Thank you for this beautiful poem Amanda.
@Gabrielle S. I'm not hating I'm merely pointing out hypocrisy when I see it. But I understand you didn't see it. Should you choose to face reality today, the link and timestamp have been provided. May many blessings be bestowed upon you. Periodt.
@Mr. Meerkat thats fine, never said it didn't happen sir. Again, I haven't seen it to say it was disrespectful. Your hate won't stand here. Be blessed.
@Gabrielle S. https://youtu.be/j3a6n_1owPY 1:10
@Gabrielle S. Just because it didn't happen in this video, doesn't mean it didn't happen. I saw it and she was being disrespectful, just as the lady in this video was being. Conveniently you didn't notice when it was the other way around though. Good luck finding new things to complain about post-Trump lol
@Mr. Meerkat your the problem. I never said "white woman". and I didn't watch the full inauguration. Maybe you should make that comment on a video where its shown. Because it holds no weight here it's not in THIS video.
Ya well I saw a black lady scrolling on her phone no more than 2 minutes after Biden was introduced and began speaking. Show a little respect for your new president and for the person up there hypocrite.
Excellent! Profund
Super WOW üëãüëãüëã
I feel blessed to have heard this... you are amazing. Thank you
She peeled outta there when she was done. She could have held back a moment and taken in the praise she deserved. Humble lady. Moving poem.
Or maybe she just needed to pee üòÜ DC in jan is cold
As someone who has done public poetry reading many times ‚Äì when you're in it, you feel strong, focused, empowered. As soon as the reading's over, you're back to being a little squeaky mouse, trying to find a hole where to hide. People who like attention don't become poets or writers :D
I was just about to comment this, you can tell she is humble through her body language. All around incredible young woman
·Éí·Éò·Éí·Éò·Éõ
Bravo !!!

Wonderful!
That was stunning. By far the highlight of the ceremony. Even though we're British. :-)

What a powerful Poet. So grateful for this. Her words grabbed me as soon as she spoke. I hope they were able to do it in sign language as well

About four and a half minutes too long and complete drivel from start to finish.
One of the charming and beautiful moments that could be remembered forever about this highly anticipated presidential inauguration. She filled many with hope with a glorious, unbeatable America!
Yes! Time to lock yourself in your house for half the year and watch the economy collapse. The future sure is bright.
"Now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us" ...how did out all this water get in my eyes
Well a catastrophe did, yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime.

"Come on Joe, put your diapers on, it's time to be president"

@{BlAcKrAiN} {BlAcKrAiN} #FBI
@Jack McGrath she is definitely not cool, but hypocritic
@Jack McGrath Hi, I'm aware this is the internet, but I believe I never saw an argument on here that's not capable of being civilized. Unless you can tell me a good reason why it can't be, then I'm all ears üòä. (Don't take any offense to this, I just genuinely want to know why that's your opinion)
@WOHB #OPSquad by gas, l think you mean petrol... yeah it‚Äôs pricey, counterbalance that with totally free healthcare... cradle to grave including prescription drugs.... l don‚Äôt need healthcare insurance...British system.
@paul kenneally hopefully you enjoy your gas prices
@Salty Gorilla Racist wow. It's ok, you're jealous becuase she is successful, and you are not.
Yeah a future as a 3rd world country.
This poem was garbage!!
Yes indeed!!!!
@paul kenneally That' because sjw shitholes like California and New York are overcrowded by woke brainwashed ppl.
@ramj0y Oy vey , that's racist. What about asian womens???
America died in november. You are living now into a totalitarian communist state. GG
@paul kenneally what you call ‚Äúbitter and enraged at everyone‚Äù I call someone who actually had the balls to not hide in a corner like Obama and other past presidents did. That‚Äôs why they hated Trump so much. He wasn‚Äôt afraid to speak out. Let‚Äôs see Biden do the same....but I think we all know who‚Äôs REALLY in power here. It ain‚Äôt Biden, he is merely Kamala Harris‚Äôs puppet. Cant stand her either. Less than a year ago, she called him a racist, and she said she believed the women who accused him. Anything for power. And who better than a man who clearly needs to be sent to a nursing home? I could name a few things Trump has done, but I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôd stand on what I believe was good or not. But I‚Äôll name a few things: Building up our military, the trade relations with China, declared worship as essential during the pandemic (while everyone else wanted to keep everything closed), and should I mention unemployment dropping dramatically low?? That‚Äôs only a few things....and within 3 days, Biden is undoing pretty much everything and screwing the entire country. Hell, I‚Äôm not the biggest Trump fan, but damn, I‚Äôd rather have him than this guy. You really think Biden will be any better??? What exactly does he have to offer?? That he has hairy legs? Or that I‚Äôm not black since I didn‚Äôt vote for him?
@Smooth Annie maybe,as l see it,all DJT did was crush America. Shame because he was a fun and charming guy who became bitter and enraged at everyone. Spicer, Comey,Cohen,Bolton etc. What did he do for America the days after the election? Play golf,refuse to attend the inauguration,led a riot. Don‚Äôt Americans deserve better? Now watch as his own life disintegrates. Divorce,bankruptcy,prison even exile,nothing should be ruled out.
@paul kenneally and now the stench of Biden has arrived
@Tri Truong hope is not a method
@Tri Truong it is delusion and deception nothing more
Agreed. She gives me hope.
@ethan mariani idk, when I saw the comment thread I didnt really see anybody getting too offended
@Iron thx for the hint, but why easily offended???
@ethan mariani Im talking about when pill bug put the snowflake emojis
@LH SD I'm not deeming everyone a racist though, even though there are racist people in this country. I was talking to a person who was claiming that this poem promotes "naetivity and stupidity". That is just wrong, the whole poem was about rebuilding our country because it is far from perfect. People are just looking for excuses to hate on her.
@Iron ?
@ethan mariani They called you a snowflake, somebody who gets offended easily. I'm pretty sure thats what it is at least, I don't use tik tok
Not a good future, that's for sure. But a future nonetheless.
Yes, pretty sure the infrastructures are built by poets
Yes they are in America of all races. These young people are our future and we are proud of them all
@Edward Smith Sure, smh
I am not a fool. I am reasonably intelligent (despite your bias slant) I believe Biden won fair and square. Fake conservatives want to invalidate black and brown votes from urban areas. Your position is essentially translate into the new ‚ÄúJim Crow‚Äù caucus. There you go.
@Edward Smith If you belive biden actually got 10 million more votes than obama did you're a fool.
@I made an account To comment Of course that's what he did. That's what rascist do. Skin color first.
Not when evil people steal elections they don't.
@ethan mariani I bet if Trump said that exact same speech you would love it
@Cory Goodman sorry mate,Trump lost popular vote,lost swing states,lost Georgia ffs,lost all court filings,lost respect,paid less taxes than me or you,oh and about to lose millions in the upcoming divorce.All the best
@paul kenneally Trump won. Biden cheated. Pass it on....
So glad her parents didn‚Äôt choose abortion
@I made an account To comment No it's because there is literally no way how she is promoting naivety and stupidity. It's just people hating on the color of her skin.
@Maria Rogers Is she a activist said she was a poet
Yep it‚Äôs just what America needs another activist without a real job, she could be head of ‚Äúnew speak‚Äù
I think she was a gift from God yesterday. America needs a great voice and she was great
@ethan mariani you've triggered all the woke puppets with one comment.üëç
@Giavannie Gianguzzi No country is perfect,and we have plenty of idiot politicians here. As for responsibility,joined Army at 17,served in Germany,Northern Ireland,Falklands and Bosnia. Now retired I did my duty.
@ethan mariani you seem to have no idea what you're talking about
@Confusion - well it appears his comment referring to me being full of communist illusions has been deleted. That was his response to a light hearted comment from me. When I asked for an explanation he comes back saying communists don't know they're communists due to brainwashing or something along those lines. Maybe I'm missing something
@Giavannie Gianguzzi DJT used to be charming and fun.(Home Alone,Simpsons etc)What happened? He dissolved into a strange,narcissistic person.Truly mocked and unloved outside of his country. 400,000 dead Americans from Coronavirus, economy in ruins and a failed coup are the legacy. I wish that wasn‚Äôt the case. Watch now as he abandons everyone to save his skin,starting with his family. I‚Äôm not jealous,l know that if l fall I‚Äôll tonight,here in England,all my years of work and savings won‚Äôt be wiped out to pay my medical bills. Good luck and stay healthy,as for Don,well he will continue his luxury lifestyle,not paying taxes (his own words) and not care about America.
@Confusion - fair enough
@afro hammite01 thats a risky thesis!
@DerBasierte so true, Americans are just subjected to old white people now? Ideologies change and the new generation of people will be vastly different from the ones taking position in our government now.
@ethan mariani don't all democrats.
So true!
@Jay Coops Though I am confused. How is he saying that you're a brainwashed communist? Just asking out of curiosity.
@Jay Coops In all honesty, I'm neutral and just trying to keep the peace. So no I cannot answer that question because I don't side with either of you. But I'm still trying to understand both of your points.
@ethan mariani i hope you have or never have children. Youre to unstable.
No, that's how America might end. That's how the true people of the USA will become extinct.
@{BlAcKrAiN} {BlAcKrAiN} I wonder. What‚Äôs your vision on how America should be?
@Confusion - I've attempted to see it from his point of view, however he's saying a whole load of nothing every time he responds. Since you seem to side with him whatever point he's trying to make, will you be any better at explaining the reason why I'm a brainwashed communist?
Ahmen to that üôè
@Jay Coops ¬† I know this is far from the topic, but it would be nice if you could try to see from his point of view instead of responding with childish comebacks. I recommend you do that if you want a civilized argument. But that's none of my business, because I'm in dreamland.
@Salty Gorilla facts though
@Salty Gorilla so funny üòê
@Jay Coops I cannot be in dreamland because Biden and Obama are not present here.
@ethan mariani You're the one in dreamland bud
@Jay Coops you must still be in sleep mode ,like 90 % of the people. check out the incarnation of ahriman on rudolf steiner (use online sources)
@ethan mariani well as expected, that was a load of drivel. They way you type reminds me of the anti-covid conspiracy warriors which have been out in force over the past year
@Jay Coops the problem with leftie communist people is, that they do not realize they are communist ,because of the hefty brainwash over the last 50 years in the western hemisphere.
@Saww Sawwy if back to normal means deep state and gate to hell ,you might be correct
@Saww Sawwy hate is a typical leftie coomunist transgender excuse in order to contorl free speech
@Saww Sawwy hat is a typical leftie communist excuse in order to cotnrol free speech
ethan mariani you are fraught with hate and disgust. I thought you claim to be conservative.Hahahahaha hypocrite. It‚Äôs over. We are back to normal. History will remember her. Sorry She is already trending all over the world.
@ethan mariani care to explain how I'm full of communist illusions then lol
@Jay Coops yes
@Edward Smith your being deceived
@ViVi ???
@mjskillz23 she isnt
Biden touching girls compilation
@witch, please ethan mariani probably can't understand the "complex" words. He probably can only understand words like "huge, wall, bigly and very strong."
thats what I'm saying
@Noah Ziegler forgive me, but Biden got 81 million,that makes him the winner,not only electoral college,but the popular vote too.Trump twice lost the popular vote, but won 2016, but that is the system.
@paul kenneally for words are you people actually real or bots can you people be so docile as to what is coming now

@mikhailabakunin Yes. The Handmaid's Tale.
@T Everett thanks. Didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd get it since I didn‚Äôt post pictures with the comment. But good for you.
@mjskillz23 haha. Good oneüëçüèª
@T Everett lol. Yeah sure of course it doesn‚Äôt. Lol. Man if I was as stupid as you I wouldn‚Äôt publicly announce it. Lol
No she perpetuates racism that doesn't exist.
She is full of sh** and this new administration and the last few president are too!
never doubted it
@ethan mariani she‚Äôs probably 200 times smarter than you. Actually I‚Äôm sure of it.
She wrote an amazing poem, there's no changing that.
Yes, young black women will save America...again. Maybe, just maybe, this time round they will be recognized by all of America.
Day dream!
@Kiddo Matt What do you mean how does my comment have any relevance to what you just said or did you just assume that I thought the election result was rigged?

If only they could just get the chance.
@ethan mariani boo mr triggered man. Get over it. Your man lost. So what! This is how great democracies work. Get over it.
Amazing young lady!
@ethan mariani Bruh, shut up. She speaking facts.
This comment! üíØ
@ethan mariani what are you even on about üòÇ do you even know what communism is
you must be full of cliches or watched too many movies
@paul kenneally haha
@ethan mariani are you writing from your basement trying to avoid the Feds? Won‚Äôt work mate,you‚Äôre toast.
@witch, please and did you make that assumption because you also see a difference in skin colour and just assumed that this was about race even though no one hinted it except for you?
@ethan mariani Based on what? Did you even hear her poem? Or did you just glare at her skin?
@ethan mariani promoting people just like yourself then
Already the stench of Trump has been dissolved.
Hehhehhehe she referenced hamilltoonnnn
Love that Hamilton reference. History is indeed watching.
@RavenousMama HarleyLover That's so great. Thank you!

For sure , loved her stage presence, A class act.
That is the funniest comment that I have ever read haha üòÑ you have a really good sense of humor
@Jimmy George Could you give me a reason why racial injustice is not something someone would bring up when talking about American struggles when slavery, white supremacy, and segregation make up the entirety of American history? Don't worry, YOU CANT!! Just because you want to stay ignorant to the fact that POC are treated differently doesn't mean the whole country should as well.
@KayanoSolos Yes, it cheapens what they do when they have to bring up race ad nauseum. Get a new tune.
@Jimmy George If you're talking about her than you not only ignorant but absolutely disgusting. Thinking that talking about racial injustice "cheapens" something that you could never compose so gracefully in your entire LIFE is just pure idiocy. You will ABSOLUTELY NEVER do write or preform something CLOSE to that. Especially if most of your day includes you sitting in you ass miserably trying to bring down such a talented, intelligent young lady. Go do something better with you're life, cause this AINT it.
She stinks. We know how she got that job. And she had to cheapen it all further by bringing race into it. LOL
but fr tho
@San Cambly Yes, my FACT was correct. Communism is biblically a tool of hell. No opinions here. But thanks. üòä

@Salty Gorilla Does her being a HARVARD graduate mean anything to you? Do you have a GED?
@Salty Gorillawhen I see your kids on something like this I'm going to laugh and boo at them dumb a'kids
So sad with these comments I am reading
@San Cambly Just stay the way as you are, you'll would be doing us a massive favor!
@Deezle Berbingson It wasn't broken, but more hardware technology had to catch up to the software. Software is still far a head of hardware.
@Lashan Yes, but her diction was off and those pretentious hand gestures were a distraction.
‚Äã@John Smith So all we have to do is make the necessary advancements in hardware to fix our problem?
@Deezle Berbingson I worked for CIA from 1998 to 2000. "WE" were developing that software. IT 24 yrs retired (network engineer and programmer)! The hardware technology wasn't up to par when writing the code. It seems they are using the code now with much improvement!
@Deezle Berbingson " recognition software " I think you missed the point!
@John Smith You can be colorblind all you want until you realize facial recognition software isn't.
@Deezle Berbingson 2.0 X seems better. That orange traitor turned the white house into race issues and it seems we are going through it again. This hate between the races needs to stop! I am really sick of all races! I guess I am color blind! I see people trying to push their agenda no matter who it steps on!
@John Smith watch it in double speed and put it in its entirety as voiceover in that deep house song you keep hearing at the store.
I thought it was lame!

My sentiment exactly. She is stunning and I was hard for me to concentrate on the rest. I
@LaughingSaint isn't she a beautiful young lady. I think anyone who can't see beauty and intellect in her is blind or just being obnoxious.
@Salty Gorilla- They mentioned it on CNN. Also Anderson Cooper interviewed her. She was quite impressive. She is a smart young lady and an incredibly talented poet.
@Jesse Baker üòÇüòÇ whatever you say dumbo. You probably also think that blm/antifa burned down cities all year for "equality" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Salty Gorilla no we didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs the people on the right that has made it that way so stop blaming the dems
@San Cambly you're a big man for comparing a 14 year old kid to a 22 year old. Now how does it feel for a teen to be more accomplished than you will ever be?
@Jesse Baker it's what you angry little ppl on the left have made it üòÇüëèüëèüëç
Hell ya I‚Äôm in love ü•∞
@Salty Gorilla wow that‚Äôs what this country has come to
@Bailey Ballin why in the world would someone not be impressed with this young lady. Omg she's smart, beautiful voice and so pretty on top of everything. What is wrong with adults anymore. üëã
@Salty Gorilla she is the first National Youth Poet Laureate (won in 2017). She also published a poetry book. That, and her Alma Mater being Harvard, it‚Äôs safe to assume she is incredibly smart and dedicated to her passion. Also that she did indeed write the poem.
@Salty Gorilla he lied tooooooo much
@Sakal Nikeo Oh sh!t, bc she said she wrote it?? ü§Ø Wish all you leftards would've taken Trump on his word for the past 4 years.
@Salty Gorilla Just did some research, and not only did she write this poem (and many others which are just as great), she is also a recent graduate of Harvard University. So yes, this woman is smart and then some. Which was pretty obvious from the start... üôÑ
@Salty Gorilla Anderson Cooper interviewed her and she said that she wrote it.
@Salty Gorilla Ahh, yes. Complimenting a female in any capacity indeed makes you a "simp". Very wise, Mr. Salty Gorilla. üòå
@TB Wms you know this how?
@Salty Gorilla- Jill Biden discovered her at a reading. Yes, it's her work. The girl is awesome! Period.
@Jesse Baker you're saying that based on a speech she delivered, you don't even know if she wrote it. You speak as if you know her life story üòÇüòÇ
Make all of the jokes you want but, she is a smart woman
Simp
I literally sat there watching her and forgot I was on a call !!
This made me smile ... Zoe , Canadian neighbor

@amadhaun22 : YES MA'AM : SPEAK TRUTH WE ALL HAVE A JOB HERE : NO TWO R ALIKE.
Indeed she CAN !!!!!

Exactly what I was thinking ü§™üòÇü§£

Wow. Battle Rap mixed with politics. Love it.
Imagine where she can be in 40 years. Maby two meters to the left. And she will be the ONE.
Sublime graceü§ç
ABC 123
Terrible
Hear, Hear! Very eloquent.
Terrible
BEAUTIFULLY done! amazing.
She reminds me of mrs. Maisel !
A beautiful thing, beautifully rendered. Nice.
That was beautiful i started crying because everything she said is so true.. this country isn't broken it's just unfinished that is so strong and so correct that it put tears in my eyes to sit back thinking about it.
Shut up
Amanda Gorman has just delivered a message that rivals MLK  JFK. Absolutely mesmerizing and inspiring. Highlight of the inauguration, thank you miss Gorman
Such an amazing young woman, beautiful inauguration, I feel such hope after today! üíñ
Damn, If this doesn‚Äôt move people you‚Äôve gotta get a soul. Her words speak of truth.
I think trump was wrong, she has the BEST words, absolutely beautiful!!
Amazing iconic poem that will shine a light on America's new future
#BlackGirlMagic #BlackExcellence‚ù§
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ú®
Her parents must be extremely proud.
Damn damn damn... I‚Äôm crying my heart outüò≠üò≠ This young lady not only gave me hope about the future, she showed me what are young people will become. God bless her and her parents for their love of a future leader.
did her poem mention bidens friends with kkk ? rhyme that beethoven
Your family are friends with Biden?
This is just a strange comment
Liar. Liar.
Great job... This young lady Exceeded Inaugural Expectations...
New hats, T shirts and bumper stickers available... Resist 46
STFU  shove them
This speech was written by a man... listen to it
@J Guyon a question people must ask you every day
@Alisdair how does that make any sense
So was your comment
People are saying Joe Biden is racist no he is not look at that he has blk woman talking in singing its not about color its in the heart we all bleed the same blood trump had everyone believing him wake up America let's all come together no more fighting no hating other people not your neighbors let's open are hearts I just want America to be at peace in pull all together amen
Thank you
Fantastic talent
don't understand it, but I could listen to her till the cows come home !?
Beautiful in every way possible
This was the best poem I‚Äôve heard
Wow, she smashed it!!
made me tear up
We should all accept that a corrupt senile guy got more votes than Obama without even campaigning.
Amanda Gorman is the face and voice the USA should have to outshine the unsavory emotions which are present in every country.
I'm sure her skin color had nothing to do with her being picked to do this.
ah you are the "do the research" type I see...
BE THE LIGHT! Amazing young Woman!
I honestly haven't felt as comforted and hopeful in a year as I was watching her speak. She is absolutely beatific.
Oh and I love so love she said Dr. Biden..
This young lady is amazing, God bless Amanda Gorman.
She's phenomenal and amazing!
Watching from Canada--this lady should run from president in the future! Such poise, such determination, such eloquence. It's been too long since we've heard anything like this while Cartman was in charge of the circus at the Whitehouse.
Biden is one of the US‚Äôs worst warmongers in recent history. Yugoslavia Iraq Afghanistan Libya Syria Ukraine
Maya Angelou reincarnated in this young lady and she has added her own flare. I am proud again. Lots of work to be done, but it has been an excellent day..
My mom cried after listening to this. I may be a Canadian, but I have family in America. She is talking like a true American.
Thank you neighbor üá∫üá∏üíìüá®üá¶
THANK U FATHER! THANK U FOR LOVING US THROUGH HER! BLESS U MS. AMANDA GORMAN.!
@joe joe what are you talking about, why would the mom want kfc? You don't even know if the commenter's mom is vegetarian or eats meat. If you were attempting a racist joke based on the kfc stereotype, how do you know the commenter's mom is black?
@K B wow you got offended by a positive comment. That's how you know somebody is sad.
@Kathryn Ain‚Äôt that how it always is?
I am not gonna lie so did I. And I can tell I am tough.
I cried hard. It was a heck of a performance and her words hit me hard.
My Dad cried too and he‚Äôs not even American. But he cries at everything especially on the rare occasion I got a good school report
@Kathryn There‚Äôs waterproof. Check it out.
@joe joe yo momma ran out of mayonnaise and started crying
@K B lmao, you're a POS.. but that was funny lol
this was the wrong day for eyeliner, that's for sure -- so inspired
@K B ü§°
@K B The point is that this really touched some people in a very good and hopeful way. Acknowledging the difficulties that we face. Feeling resolute. Feeling pride. A positive strong emotion can be focused into actual change.
My cat went to her litter box. Whats your point?
me too ....beautiful...
I cried.
spectacular, I am deeply moved
So this is what rap sounds like for white people

And the military industrial complex is back in business. C'mon guys when we going back to war? Theres $$ to be made!
Amazing - Amanda and Joe Biden both have speech impediments. Reminds me that Speech-language Pathologists make a long-term impact!
What a great day for poets all around. I personally walked away with so much from Amanda Gorman's poem this morning. My favorite part is ‚ÄúThere is always a light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it. If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.‚Äù Written so well and spoken so eloquently. What part of her poem goes home with you today? Is there a part of her poem that you strongly believe in or may change your life? I'd love to hear your positive thoughts?
my math teacher sent me here
I see 1.4 butt hurt trumpers
So beautiful
Proud to be an American.
Well done
Brave enough to be the pure lightüí°
Omg! She gave me beautiful goosebumps I love her..ü§óüôè
So delighting ...
The fact that people disliked this video shows that we are so far from equality and unity but we‚Äôre getting there whether privileged people like it or notüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ
@Brooklyn Collier You'll never be free until you stop blaming whites for your failures. The whole culture of race baiting is what holds you back. It seems the democrats have ruined your people forever, past and present.
@Encore Baby ALSO if you knew anything about impoverished communities and why they are mostly POC i'd suggest looking up about our entire countries history and how the government made sure to not only put POC in these already run down neighbor hoods, but also how the War on Drugs was a ploy to keep those communities poor even after segregation and Jim Crow ended. POC are being prioritized because we never have been and our previous president did nothing but perpetuate that poverty not only for POC but for everyone underneath the 1%. one day at a time dude...you'll be okay if youre not first in line.
@Encore Baby IT's an easy google fact check...Biden never said that. In FACT he said he WOULDNT be discrimating against any one with the covid relief bill. It's up to the rest of the reps in congress to actually pass it. Biden's words (as always) are being taken out of context by sore losers.
@Encore Baby A covid relief bill has to be passed through congress...anyone who claims to know politics should know that. Also where is that tweet you speak off?? never once saw him call out "everyone but whites and males".when it came to covid relief. If youre refering to the 1% im sure your not even close to being apart of that percentage...he said the priorities were 1) Everyone wears masks, which people STILL arent doing. 2) 100 million vaccinations, which a select group of people claim they aren't getting and 3)reopening the majority of schools which I assume you wanted?? Please explain to me where the priorities excluded white people. Do you only believe that your being excluded because POC are becoming more INCLUDED?? hmmmm
@Snore Lax If you knew anything about American History and the current climate, you would know that alot of this countries previous/ current policies actively and blatantly worked against POC...to the point of us still being effected by those decisions made by our government officials. Some examples are Jim Crow laws, The War on Drugs, and Over policing black neighborhoods. Her speech actually spoke on unifying everyone in the sense that POC deserve to be apart of the same America that white people boast about all the time. You need to understand why our History had such damaging affects on POC and how long my ancestors (and now my generation) fought/are still fighting racism on the micro aggressive and grand scales. We DO NOT believe in an upper hand....we want to be 100% equal to our white counterparts. If you don't understand that then I hope you get well soon.
@Encore Baby how far did you reach for those statements? what specific policies are you speaking of that work against men and white people? I'd really love to know why your lying just have things fit your narrative...
Yes! Now lets make policies based on the color of peoples skin! Progress!
This was riveting and spectacular. This is a poem that history will set beside MLK's "I Have a Dream" speech.
@Reaver Red ?
@JJfoff me too ,and l am not even an American (English). What a performance,it will be studied for centuries.Welcome back,Americans,those traitors will wish they hadn‚Äôt called in sick,Amanda thanks.
you could not be more wrong about it, you seem to be a victim of total delusion
First time ever I have tears from listening to someone poem or speech. I replay and watch it again.

it truly is..I have to hear it again ..and again...
‚ÄúDemocracy can be periodically delayed but it will never be permanently destroyed ‚Äú üôåüôåüôåüëåüëå that is black excellence in every way

YAWN
Once again the American is now again making a History first 2008 - 2016 1st African American President Barack Obama and first African American lady Michelle Obama . Now finally first African Asia American woman Kamla Harris . Now let's the United State of America heal from all of what we went through with our now former so called president Trump had done wrong for us and start a new chapter
1.3K white supremacists didn't like this video
Don't like election being stolen = white supremacy now. This whole event is hypocrisy.
absolutely beautiful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA_UfmJEUnAt=3s Biden's full inauguration speech!!
she‚Äôs amazing
She sounds more presidential than all presidents of the US since JFK. With all best wishes from Germany.
Aloha! Excellent speaker/ excellent words. A privilege to listen to a wonderful voice reciting words of hope  promise of a different and hopeful beginning! Be Well!
Reads as a better "Speech" than it actually is. I do want to say this, I have never in my life cared for Biden, not even a little bit, with that said in 2016 when Trump won the Republican Nomination I swore I would not vote Republican while he was President, after the way Republicans behaved over the past four years I likely will never vote for one again. I voted for Biden as he was all we had to oppose what was easily the worst President and hopefully the closest to a Dictator America will ever have. I realized during this time that all the criticism I have had of every single Past President, was unwarranted in comparison. So I offer this. While I do not care for Biden I think he has done an amazing job trying to be President since the November Election since we have not had one in four years. I am luke warm to Kamala and I understand our politics are largely different, but she and Joe will work for us. So regardless of how you feel, know that this young lady is right, we are not working for perfection, but a system we can work with. I think we got that here, so thank you. Let's look ahead!
@Mr. Meerkat Nice to meet you. Maybe somedays our paths will cross :)
@SlayerofFiction That shows maturity and humiliation on your part. Like you, I have those qualities.
@Mr. Meerkat Well I am told I dot the I's and cross the T's at least in History and go to another in-depth level on Facts in general. I suppose that's true, I ended up reading three biographies on FDR, whom I did not like before and previously liked Trump but after reading his two books and three others, well..... no. SO I understand your statement completely, I am not always right, but I try to be as accurate as possible. I get my ass handed to me from time to time and like a grown man, throw a fit, insults then come back and eat the crow :P
@SlayerofFiction I love Ratt! Probably the song Back for More is my favorite but I like Round and Round too. Lol, the fact that you can remain objective is probably what triggers sis, but it's important I think to remain that way. It's just beneficial to my mental health personally. But I struggle with it I admit, at times to stick to the facts or at least what I perceive to be factual, If that made any sense to you.
@Mr. Meerkat One thing anyone who knows me well will tell you is I only use Facts, so much so my ivy league sibling tells me to shut up ;) Never cared for Slayer, where I grew up was an AC/DC town. I was more of a RATT guy myself ;)
@SlayerofFiction I just thought it was interesting. What is your name about, you a slayer fan? Lol
@Mr. Meerkat Had to look that up. Sounds like a medicated star system :P
@SlayerofFiction primal zodiac sign
@Mr. Meerkat Thank you, but I would remind you that Trump is the one who called Democrats and anyone who did not support him his 'Enemies" We will do ok, not gonna get what we want, but we will be back on track chugging along. Curious, what makes you choose meerkat as your name?
Unfortunately your fair and sensible pov doesn't jive with the new "with us or against us" regime.
Beautiful.
Amazing delivery well done....body language superb.
Just: wow. Amazing, left me speechless. "So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but to what stands before us"
Love the references to Maya Angelou, MLK Jr. and Lin Manuel Miranda! ‚ô•Ô∏é Were there any other allusions I missed?
The granddaughter of Martin Luther king
Whooooo cares?
No need to be salty Judy
Wow ‚ù§
Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è üòç
I hope and pray that this woman's poem today is mentioned in every history book that talks about this inauguration. This poem had, "Most Famous Political Speeches of all Time" vibes. This should be remembered alongside every historic line of speech from American history.
So poised and graceful üëë
I love how they claim to unite the people but the entire poem is about how what half the country believes is evil rofl. Pseudo intellectual garbage that appeals to the lowest common denominator. The world is laughing for sure.
She is amazing! She overcame a speech problem herself and wants to be President in 2036. I'd vote for her!
ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æ
Beautiful poem from a beautiful young Lady.
Well done Amanda. Damn! You nailed it. left me with goose pimples. What a gift! Go for it girl. Presidential elections 2034!! Not a dream anymore
Incredible!!!!!
Perfect
Nice rhyme
.... bring out that singing parrot ü¶ú....
Hope for the future
I usually don't enjoy reading or listening to poetry - I prefer prose - but I listened to Ms. Gorman, and enjoyed it thoroughly. She may force me to reassess my view of that written and verbal art. Very well done.
Don't everyone know that is a Muslim
That's wasn't a poem, that was a speech. How is that girl anyway? ü§î üôÑ

okay ms. future president üëÄ
I hate the message, hate Biden. But damn, this was a good poem.
Compare this class with the stinking hordes we saw on the 6th. On the same spot. Two Americas. Choose.
Left speechless. Wow. Just wow.
I've watched this 5 times now. Wow....
"There is always light if we are brave enough to see it if we are brave enough to be it." Wow!
See your face when they demand Reparations.
WOW. Just wow. Amazing young lady.
Brilliant! üëçüëèüòä
I can't imagine what people could dislike about this video enough to vote it down.
@Albin MRespectfully, her speech was more an example of prose than poetry. I suggest doing some research on the difference between the two.
@Liesmith Agree to disagree. To me and many that heard it, it was not a poem. Respecting other's opinions is a part of embracing the message of unity that our President stands for.
@Mr. Meerkat what do you mean no timing or verse structure? Did you hear her speak?
@Mr. Meerkat It literally is a poem, though. They aren't speaking their truths, they're speaking a falsehood. It might be one that they believe, but that doesn't make it true. It uses rhythm, rhyme, and metaphor to evoke strong emotions. Poems don't need verses. I think that the people complaining about it probably expect all poems to sound like limericks.
@Liesmith It does sound more like political prose to me. No timing or verse structure.. Passionate yes but I wouldn't call it a poem. Calling people idiots for speaking their truths does not embrace Biden's message of unity. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I've already seen two idiots saying it wasn't a poem, so I guess that's the best complaint they've got. In truth, I think it bothered them in a way they can't articulate, because they're part of the problem and lack the capacity for introspection.
Trump supporters, what do you expect?
Hate is a powerful motivator.
Dislikes????????????
This young lady had me in tears what a great poem
Am glad I watched with my daughters.
What a moment. Her words were amazing yet I am trying to understand why there are 1.2k thumbs down. :(
Bc trump supporters
I don't they are down voting her.
She did such an amazing job!
She has the power in her voice üòçüòçüòç

Bravo, Amanda Gorman!
That was amazing and inspiring and beautiful
"Mr. President, Dr. Biden, Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, Americans and the world: When day comes we ask ourselves, 'where can we find light in this never-ending shade, the loss we carry, a sea we must wade?' "We've braved the belly of the beast, we've learned that quiet isn't always peace. And the norms and notions of what just is isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished. "We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. "And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. "And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide, because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. "Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew; that even as we hurt, we hoped; that even as we tired, we tried; that we'll forever be tied together victorious, not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division. "Scripture tells us to envision that 'everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid.' If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we've made. "That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it, because being American is more than a pride we inherit ‚Äì it's the past we step into and how we repair it. "We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. "In this truth, in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption we feared at its inception. "We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked 'how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe,' now we assert: 'how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?' "We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our enaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. "Our blenders become their burdens but one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy in change, our children‚Äôs birthright. "So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the winds swept north, east where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rinsed cities of the midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful. "When day comes, we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it."

Hey, thanks SO much for posting the words to this! Now I can read it and save itüôÇ
It's even better written. Thanks for taking the time to do this!
thanks for transcribing this! going on my wall xx
This is the next Maya Angelou. What a wonderful young woman.
üò¢ im proud
This speech gotta be turned into a song
Being European you just singlehandedly restored my faith in America.. ‚Äúwhat just is, isn‚Äôt always justice‚Äù Wow...
@K B You‚Äôre freakin‚Äô hilarious. From what comedy show are you? Surely people like you can‚Äôt exist for real..
Figures a European would say that, yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. Must be in your blood. trump Life!!
Such a beautiful compression of compassion and hope. Thank you.
Grace is amazing when presented with truth and purposeful intent.
@Jesse Armstead I hear you! üòÅ
LOVE and RESPECT! This brought me to tears.....tears for hope and and tears for healing! THANK YOU Amanda Gorman!
et en plus elle est jolie !!!
Je suis d'accord.
Got goosebumps all over; bathed in the warmth, richness and eloquence of her voice. I'm not an American but I connect to the HOPE, FAITH and LOVE her words stirred up. üôåüèæ@ Amanda Gordon. God bless you!
Blown away man, so classic this girl's poetry! And also looking amazingly beautiful and charismatic!
Hhhoomme rruuuuuunnn!!!

@Betty Boop The point is the Nazi's used disinformation to foment hate and insurrection. This is exactly what the alt-right is doing down.
@omegamanxxx Give me a break with your drama. They were citizens rightfully protesting about election integrity. At least they didn't burn down innocent people's businesses and assault the elderly in the streets like BLM.
·Éí·Éò·Éí·Éò·Éõ
@K B You got it backwards friend. The people who stormed the capital took a page out of the Nazi playbook. On November 9 to November 10, 1938, in an incident known as ‚ÄúKristallnacht‚Äù, Nazis in Germany torched synagogues, vandalized Jewish homes, schools and businesses and killed close to 100 Jews.

@K B you embarrass us all.
@Ryan Ford oh no whatever they're smoking is making them nuts
What‚Äôs ‚Äúnew‚Äù?? This is only Obama‚Äôs 3rd term.
@Ryan Ford I don't, sounds like the kind of aggressive delusions a person gets from staying awake for far too long on methamphetamine.
@K B mate wtf you smoking cuz i want some
Your going to be it: yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!

@SportsHighlights because other countries admit and confront their faults/errors... In America, we build statues, fly flags and 'elect' traitorous presidents in honor of them.

@Steve S Do you always ask questions to arguments you can‚Äôt argue? You didn‚Äôt address what I said first.
@Angel Passion Do you always deflect to a different subject? Do you support BLM and reparations?
@Steve S Are you the same kind of person that had a temper tantrum when Trump left ?
@Angel Passion Re you the same kind of person that stands there with your BLM fist in the air, screaming reparations?
@Steve S Nobody said you had to be guilty over someone‚Äôs evil and barbaric actions. Nobody said it was your problem.
@Steve S Calm down üòÇ It‚Äôs not that serious. Nobody‚Äôs talking about slavery every single day. You‚Äôre exaggerating. The woman in the video mention slaves only one time and y‚Äôall go crazy. The beautiful poet wanted to take pride in who she is and where she came from. There are schools that talk about slavery but they don‚Äôt go into detail. They gloss over the things that happened. It‚Äôs history and we should learn it regardless of how many years ago. That goes for the next generation, and the generation after that.
@rosymar ramirez You said you weren't going to waste your time trying to prove a point. And the next 5 sentences are you trying to prove a point. And you failed at doing so. "There's a whole system that is still very unfair to minorities, not just black." You do realize 23% of congress is minorities? We had a minority president. And now a minority black vice president. That is the system you think is racist? And your way of proving slavery exists today is a woman complained about a nursing home? That's really a stretch. I mean REALLY a stretch.
@Angel Passion Show me one damn school in the entire nation that hasn't taught the history of slavery! JUST ONE!!!! So it is being taught, but does it have to be taught every single day for the rest of eternity?! Does it have to be part of the daily conversation? Am I somehow guilty of slavery and racism because 150 years ago people I never met, did some bad things to people I never met. And yet somehow this is my problem? That I need to atone for this? It's funny how you mention about learning from our history but not removing it, yet something tells me you cheered when they started pulling down all the statues that REMINDED EVERYONE OF THIS COUNTRY'S SLAVERY HISTORY!
Too much Fentanyl in your system will do that.
@Eddy Love it's been a month since I've been on this post. I gave up, lefties are mental.
@Kevin Non-work ok now that we're facing the past n repairing it. Can you please get a job n quit living off my hard-earned tax dollars
@Clint Beastwood lmao these jokers are hilarious huh?
@beki_ bean07 you will never be able to relate so I'm not even going to waste my time trying to prove a point. It's not about a slave or a race card. There's a whole system that is still very unfair to minorities, not just black. Educate yourself! You will never understand unless you're black... there's a lot that's swept under the rug. The other day a lady was complaining about a nursing home where her mom is because most of the nurses are black and she feels they're not good. Let that sink in
@SportsHighlights that‚Äôs why I mentioned that you can‚Äôt say that a Jewish person has never done or felt that way, especially during the aftermath of those events because history will always create tension between people no matter how long ago it is and that‚Äôs just the sad truth. Social Media and the internet tend to focus on the most loudest and fanatic of opinions, which is not reflective of the wider discussion regarding slavery that the average person engages in. In fact, I find videos like this to be a lot more toned down and realistic. History in America has not been recognised to nearly the same extent as it has in Germany. In a lot of parts of America, slavery is either very sugarcoated or ignored all together so it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that there is still a lot of heated debate about it today.
@Pramma Gunio Thats what Im trying to say.. There are ZERO accusations against germans for the past actions.. There are a lot of talks about how bad it was etc. but there is nobody saying directly "because of u, my grandpa died.." Which is constantly being used in America. Black people keep on saying stuff that is directly accusing you of slavery etc. when you weren't even born for 100  years.. Thats the problem
@Betty Boop ‚ÄúThousands of white men died to end it.‚Äù Lmao. All I‚Äôm saying is that we shouldn‚Äôt forget history. My post aren‚Äôt ‚Äúself-righteous‚Äù and ‚Äúdrivel‚Äù btw.
@Angel Passion So do you feel uncomfortable posting your self-righteous drivel about slavery, which ended in America 150 years ago because thousands of white men died to end it, on your slave-built iPhone? Get to it with your fake principals and do something about modern slavery if you really care.
@beki_ bean07 in USA, black women has three to four times (243%) higher maternal mortality risk than other women. The risk changes locally: In New York City, risk is twelwe times higher. Seeing chasms like this will reveal us where equality in not actualizing in society.
‚Äã@Clint Beastwood slavery is affecting through racism, and as a racism. The core point of racism is, that it's always structural, and so is slavery. Slavery is part of history of racism not so long ago, so of course it has an effect to nowadays racistic structures. And not just that: by studies we know, that traumas affect socially about five generations. That may be why white people have so big need to forget slavery and deny existing racism - we still can't face the doings of our grandgrandgrandparents. (That may be hereditary not just socially but also biologically, through epigenetic system. Luckily, genetics are not the absolute law.) USA is still holding some racially unequal laws, based of time of slavery and just after that. You also have "surprisingly" much more prisoners per capita than other "western" countries, and black men has overrepresentated among incarcetated. Ever considered, why's that? (In addition, I really was chocked, when I learned that in part of United States, person still isn't plenipotent after going through their sentence, but it may be they still can't vote. I find that totally unbelievable use of "justice".) In USA, black women has three to four times (243%) higher maternal mortality risk than other women. The risk changes locally: In New York City, risk is twelwe times higher. Ever considered, why's that? What comes of children who will lose their other or both parents? And why is USA one of the few nations still not legally given up executing its under aged humans? Seeing chasms like this will reveal us where equality in not actualizing in society. Sad thing, there's no society with no need to try to find these chasms.
Descendend from Adam and Eve, please.
@SportsHighlights Hello? What? You couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. Just about every country has an issue with somebody over what their ancestors have done. Scientific studies show that current plights black Americans face can be directly tied to the horrors of slavery - being kept from owning land, from stockpiling money to pass onto descendants, etc. In terms of history slavery is alarming recent. Everyone points to the civil rights movement, which really did nothing to atone for sins of the past, only making things going forward better - which is *something* but not nearly enough. We should keep being reminded about it until we *do* something. Germany isn‚Äôt reminded about the Holocaust nearly as much in politics anymore, why? Because they actually did a fairly good active job of making things up to the survivors of their crimes against humanity. It will never be enough, but at least they try and are sincere in their efforts. The United States has rarely been sincere in their lack of attempts to provide recompense for slavery.
@Clint Beastwood I swear if y‚Äôall hear the word ‚Äúslave‚Äù y‚Äôall are quick to say ‚Äústop dwelling on slavery‚Äù and ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù You act like her whole poem was about slavery. Chill.
@Clint Beastwood why would we drop it ??
üï∫üèªüíÉüèºüôèüèª I‚Äôll be her first husband üòçüòçüëç
Same here and we both know Biden and His son are bad People.
@John Daker Nobody was dwelling on slavery in the comment section. Besides, the poet wanted to remember where she came from, is that okay? You act like her whole poem was about slavery üôÑ
@John Daker Forgetting slavery helps in whitewashing America. Just because you don‚Äôt feel comfortable and cozy talking about it doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt.
@SportsHighlights She literally never accused white people of anything, bud. She was just pointing out the significance of how much progress has been made in the country. You're reading a bit too deep into this. It's really not weird at all...
When will we have the conversation that the government can't and shouldn't replace the missing black fathers in society indefinitely? It's so normalized that the gov picks up the pieces of broken black homes that MEN are not even part of the conversation anymore...
@SportsHighlights ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it.‚Äù -Amanda Gorman. We have to face the realties and tragedies that have took place so we can repair and move on. Pointing fingers won‚Äôt fix anything but being quiet and ignoring the realty won‚Äôt fix anything either. To move on we need to come together and fix the past. We can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúthe past is the past‚Äù because if we do, then how will we ever move on? The effects of slavery and racism are still seen in the US today. Its a matter of people not feeling attack by the mention of slavery but instead joining arms to acknowledge and move on.
@Kevin Non-work Oh, please.....get a different hobby already, will ya?
@Clint Beastwood Guess i am the only one agreeing with you.....oh...look at the flying üçÖ
‚Äã@Clint Beastwood we are still living with the ramifications of slavery, why should we avoid talking about that? Because it makes people uncomfortable?
@Clint Beastwood I bet you want to drop slavery but keep all the other history that happened during that time. You‚Äôre one of those white people who prefers not to hear what makes you uncomfortable. Sorry but it‚Äôs history. Continue to be consumed by your bubble.
@Clint Beastwood slavery is her history.
Bro a good poet doesn't make a good leader or politician...
@Clint Beastwood why? Let's not forget what was done so it never gets repeated again.
@Clint Beastwood I think you forget that that last living slave had died 50 years ago. Not just descendants of slaves but an actual imancipated slave. Let that sink in. You act as if it were so far in your history that it should be let go. I hazard to guess that you were alive at the same time as this individual.
@rosymar ramirez America was not built by slaves. Slaves were used primarily for cotton and manufacturing of textiles.
@Clint Beastwood America was built by slaves... let's not drop the slavery subject. It's part of our history
@Clint Beastwood no.
@Clint Beastwood I can't breathe
@Jam who is slavery affecting in the united states today?? What are you even talking about?
@Alex everyone already agrees slavery was bad. So what do you mean by making sure we dont make the same mistake? Do you actually think that slavery is making a comeback?
Weird how my other comment was deleted.
@Kevin Non-work we've been facing the past for a long time now, at what point can we all agree it was bad and then leave it at that?
@Clint Beastwood No, just like Christian churches wont drop "original sin". Slavery is our nation's original sin and we must face the past if we are to repair it.
@Clint Beastwood Why does it make so you uncomfortable?
@SportsHighlights funny how you mentioned Germany despite the fact that the country consistently makes the effort to remember the history and are always having conversations about the Holocaust and other atrocities. So no, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúonly America‚Äù that does this. History can be ugly and you can‚Äôt expect to be coddled and sheltered from what has already happened. Also you can‚Äôt say that a Jewish person has never done that, history is complex and still causes tension between people.
@SportsHighlights my point wasn‚Äôt to point at white people to blame them because of their history this is so we learn from it. It wasn‚Äôt my intention to make it sound like we are pointing fingers so I apologize if somehow that came off wrong. What I‚Äôm saying tho I believe people should learn about all the wrong doings from our past so we don‚Äôt make the same mistakes that is all I‚Äôm trying to say about the topic.
Everyone did bad things, all world countries but guess what nobody is accusing someone else of ancestors behaviour.. Only america, again, u guys really are kinda weird tbh..
@Alex Point is in US u are constantly returning to history and keep on repeating it.. In history, europe was one hella bad place and WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS but no jew has ever gone to a german and said "U burned my ancestors in gas cells" and "Balkan resident came to Italy and said: "U have betrayed us in ww2..That just stupidity on next level tbh..
@Clint Beastwood stfu
@Clint Beastwood just if you thought of slavery not just an American white men crusade story but as the most despicable mistake men did and the biggest victory the human kind achieved, you'd probably agree with their descendants standing tall in pride for being free. You're welcome
@Clint Beastwood Slavery is something that still affect a lot of people to this day, so why should we stop talking about it when there's still so much to uncover and so much to change? This doesn't make any sense
Yes, they learn about slavery in school. They dont need to hear it from absolutely everyone.
@Clint Beastwood no because sadly that is our history but we need to let every generation know so we as a whole don‚Äôt let that happen again and we won‚Äôt allow history to repeat itself. So no we cannot drop the subject of slavery.
@Clint Beastwood the ignorance üòê
@Clint Beastwood can you just shut up
Can we drop the slave crap already.......
Dr. Biden. LMAO LOL
A freakin standing ovation! Omg chills!
wow....what world has she been in the last 4 years....now they want open arms after there side attacked, bullied, burned down cities and even murdered people. " a nation that isn't broking" lets see calling people Nazies, bullying, censoring. All fluff no soul!
Wow. Maybe go back to school?
What a great poem. What a great delivery! I can't wait to see what she will accomplish in life!
Even as we grieved we grew.
Boring

@Abu Lahab being emotional isn't having mood swings. Stop being such an armchair psycologist.
You actually need a psychiatrist to sort out your mood swings.
beautiful work. We can see in the comments that people are wanting more poetry, less celebrity.
The words are meaningful and the diction is impeccable.
Brava Amanda! That was extraordinary!
The power of eloquence! May her words resonate and become reality üôè
POWERFUL!!!
Let us embrace the dawn about which she has written and spoken. There is immeasurable power in poetry.
Such a profound poet.. . M not an American but I am moved... Amanda
Anyone catch the Hamilton lift? ‚ÄúHistory has its eyes on us.‚Äù
@Cher Osborne Absolutely, to me both references were clearly shout-outs to Hamilton the musical!
@Kurly Kayla Thanks for that sugar bugger! Maybe, one day, you will wake up with that beautiful, natural hair, and realize you have been played! I know the shackles on the Democrat plantation are comfy- but free your mind and your a$$ will follow! Ask Candace-
@Secret Oktober78 Google what a clapback is, you‚Äôll figure it out, honeybun. You seem to not understand the situation for what it is, so lemme break it down for you. We won. You lost. We matter. You don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre irrelevant. You always have been. So stay salty with the weak, anonymous clapbacks. That‚Äôs all you‚Äôre good for. Bye ‚ù§Ô∏è
@Kurly Kayla Oh, never mind sweetie. Enjoy the illusion that a 47 year career grifter who has a segregationist background is gonna help you.
@Secret Oktober78 I do it every morning, boo. Y‚Äôall comin in with the weak clapbacks in 2021 ü§£
@Kurly Kayla Go pick your fro
I actually thought a John Legend song with that title
@Secret Oktober78 this isn‚Äôt about you, ok? Sit down.
Also "sit under their own Vine and fig tree, no one shall make them afraid..."
She confirmed that the two lines of that were Hamilton references!
@pls argue with me Same
i went to the comments to see if anyone spotted the hamilton references
@Secret Oktober78 what?
Is Hamilton cultural appropriation? Or, can only whites offend? BTW, I have no prob with the play just curious
Omg yesss and then the sitting under our own fig tree I already love this girlü§©
Yup. She tweeted LMM to ask if he heard BOTH of her Hamilton references
She asked Lin Manuel on twitter if he got the two Hamilton references
Thanks for pointing that out. I looked up the reference. Cool.
@Cavers either way it‚Äôs brilliantly captivating.
Even Napoleon by the Pyramids in Egypt. But great poet anyway. Congrats to America to have poets laureates , and use them. let poets talk, only they say the same old things for the first time.
Definitely feeling Hamilton while watching this. #hamilfan
@Larry Wang she mentioned that scripture said......
I don't know if she's referencing Hamilton or if Hamilton's referencing history.
Also the scriptural reference to sitting under own vine and fig tree!
üòç
WOW
Brilliant and beautiful and inspiring. Love it.
She shines brightly in a mostly toxic environment. Hopefully her words will not fade into background while the nation festers in the forgotten and downtrodden.
@You Tuber you are the reason people hate Americans
@You Tuber But friend, the only way you could say that biden didn't have a large turn-out is if you weren't going to count mail in ballots. Before the election all the polls had biden way ahead. Florida, Ohio, and Iowa had the lead shifting between Biden and Trump throughout their whole campaign. The mail in ballots though had Trump scared the whole time. He often talked about how he was going to pronounce those mail in ballots as fraudulent if he lost. And thats exactly what he did. But he can only fool you his followers, not us who are in a more neutral corner.
@Mark Mandel youtube took it down , leftist censorship. Everyone I shared the video with can‚Äôt unsee it. It was on sky news. In the hearing the lady said this has been debunked and it was replied ‚Äúthis is the first time we‚Äôve shown the video, how can you debunk it‚Äù
@Mark Mandel if I recall wberyone denounced the racists but said there were good people on both sides of the statue argument. It‚Äôs clear you are just taking the media narrative
@Garey Gordon He may not have won, but we won‚Äôt find out because the FBI, media, judges, military industrial , govt workers and republicans wanted him gone. So they turned their face to fraudulent activity. What‚Äôs interesting is that in dem areas poll watchers were allowed Biden had low turn out but in key areas they kept watchers out he had huge turn out. This is called voting irregularity and statistically impossible. All the court cases were dismissed due to no ‚Äústanding‚Äù saying that they didn‚Äôt have authority to launch an trial. Even by Bidens turn outs when he would speak you can see people weren‚Äôt that interested.
They won't, man. As long as there are people who WANT better for America, and live for hope and light and unity, who want our children to continue crossing lines in the sand between races, financial statuses, and anything else that promotes division, words like these will come to mind to keep everything bright. I love your comment!
@Garey Gordon those kids parents paid for their kids to be sent to the border via human trafficking (coyotes), blame the irresponsible parents not Trump
@Salty Gorilla i bet you loved the way he orphaned those six hundred kids.
@You Tuber why do you think Trump won?
@Salty Gorilla You mean the people Trump constantly lied to and cheated, didn't pay their due wages or prices, insulted, and whose enemies he refused to denounce ("There were good people on both sides") and told to wait A LITTLE, this wasn't the time YET ("Proud Boys ‚Äî Stand back, stand by")?
Bright star üôèüèΩ‚≠êÔ∏è
@You Tuber can't be forgotten üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
You mean the ppl on the left who attacked Trump everyday for the past 4 years?
@You Tuber Can you give me a video link?
@Mark Mandel I saw video evidence but it didn‚Äôt matter, there were over 100 affidavits but it didn‚Äôt matter. I know fully that it doesn‚Äôt matter what is true or not, they can even manipulate the media and the people eat it up. You will find out in 2030 when they collapse the US to seize power. Wait and see
@You Tuber Ah yes, lies. Evidence, please, or it's only a thought. Whereas Trump told something like 20,000 in his term in office, but YOU know that they were all true even when he was contradicting something he'd said before. Ri-ight.
A beautiful poem for the power structures new pawn. The media made up lies and ran a campaign against Trump and his supporters. Shame on the media and shame on the Democrats for going so low. Disagreeing about politics is ok but what happened the last four years will not be forgotten.
@Doug Carpenter Trolls can't stand the sunlight, it kills them.
Its true, she is a bright new star of hope.
It won‚Äôt as long as we are brave enough to see the light and brave enough to be the light. üíúüíúüíú

@Syd Vicous he knows that. he's a racist projecting onto a woman that's better than him.
@ethan mariani How so? The poem was about moving forward as a nation regardless of our differences. That regardless of our hardships faced, the American people can stand strong together to build a better future for those that follow.
isnt this an act of racism against white people?
wow that was an amazingly beautiful poem, how i hope america will be better with biden as president

The best, most relevant, inspiring, uplifting and engaging inaugural poem ever written. Ms. Amanda, has put forth a challenge to all Americans. "For there is always LIGHT, IF we are BRAVE enough to SEE IT, IF we are BRAVE enough to BE IT." United we stand, divided we fall!
YAY! A LESSER EVIL!!!!

This is easily the most boring thing I've seen all year. Though I suppose compared to Trump, boring is fantastic.
She's a wonderful poet. Look also at her hand gestures as she delivers he poems. Wonderful, just absolutely wonderful.
I feel like she had more movements but they got toned down for those giant microphones in her face
totally an embodied recitation-- theory of embodied cognition applicable here it seems to me... body over mind... love it!
‚ÄúPut or differences aside‚Äù what the hell was with all the riots before than when Trump was in the house or even Obama!? No this whole praising this poet is BS and shouldn‚Äôt be done very little of what she says is good and thats if u take it out of context. She‚Äôs just they‚Äôre for the fame, money and reputation nothing else it‚Äôs disgusting if you ask her of course she‚Äôll not say it but deep down that is what she‚Äôs there for and again it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting! They‚Äôre is soo much I could bash about but I‚Äôll shut up here to see how many of y‚Äôall get upset! Side not:No I didn‚Äôt take the poem out of the context of what she was trying to get across rewatch you‚Äôll see (which is what I meant earlier in my comment
See this is why I hate politics, people can‚Äôt even come up with a fuckn reply/argument to the things I say. People are just to pitiful
@d t May I ask in what way was Trump a puppet, or let me put it in a better way what has he done or evidence that has been widely proven that he is a puppet?
@Zyth so you're saying biden is the same as trump? Gotcha
@idk what im doing here several but, mainly because people are supporting such a person like Joe Biden who is a puppet Edit: put very shortly
what's your problem? just asking

Not my president

"There is always light if we are brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to be it." SO MANY MOMENTS Within this Powerful Poem! Thank You Amanda Gorman.
Such elegance, poise and conviction. It was an honor and humbling to bear witness to these spoken words. For those who disliked.. well we know who you are
And we will never forget.
She is truly amazing.
Stunning. Simply stunning...
She bad
cope
Wow just wow. So powerful. I am tearing up.
No election Joe is a fake President. He will be controlled by Schumer and Pelosi. Socialism is right around the corner thx to Joe
the US already has socialism genius
I'm glad he's fake then
yeah sure
She did an excellent job! Like, wow!

Even as we hurt, we hope. Raise this wounded world! Beautiful.
Most beautiful day in America in years.
exactly 4 years lmao
The star of the show.
Perfeita!
I almost shed a tear. Every year its the same bs. Woman is starting to sound like a broken record.
‚ÄúThe Hill We Climb‚Äù Amanda Gorman When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast, we‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is, isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it, somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect, we are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew, even as we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired, we tried, that we‚Äôll forever be tied together victorious, not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in in all of the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. That would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy, and this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can periodically be delayed, but it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us, this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves, so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us. We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be, a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free, we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, our blunders become their burden. But one thing is certain: if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left, with every breath from my bronze, pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one, we will rise from the golden hills of the West, we will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution, we will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked South, we will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful, when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid, the new dawn blooms as we free it, for there is always light if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.
Thank you all, looking forward to creating an active YouTube channel where I can reach out to all my supporters, working on it!!‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for being a fan, This is not an official channel , it is a private channel where I get to connect with my favorite fans religiously and privately I won't be able to reply every comments on my official channel, but I would reply every Comments without interruption on here. Once again, thanks for being a fan and God bless you!
From Scotland, so proud of you Amanda like I hope all Americans today would be.
Oh
Thank you so much for posting the words, that was so thoughtful of you!!
"When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? " - what is the interpretation? Darkness/gloom of the day?
Thank you!
Thank you so much, sir.
What a poem / speech. I am Brazilian and I am proud of your people. God bless America.
This is a patriotic poem.
Beautiful ‚ù§! Reading her written words is powerful. I hope that our country can collectively put her poetry in motion.

Hello there, I find it really odd replying to your comments here because I don‚Äôt usually chat with fans but I want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here . I realized how much you like and follow my channel. Thank you!!
We step out of the shade aflame and unafraid!
Nice!
PS, I'm BLACK, which means I can say whatever I want. The GOVERMENT and MEDIA PANDER TO ME NOW, so i'll just use my newfound power to say, I SEE WHAT YOU DID, YOU'RE NOT CLEVER, and your CELEBRATIONS ARE BASELESS AND SHALLOW.
Ok, cretin.
How is there 1k people with thumb down?
Trump supporters, what else would you expect?
Cuz it was boring
Sadly, it is because racists think they have a voice because of Trump. They‚Äôre running scared now though.
This was the best part. By far.
This little privileged kid can smile all she wants. last year created monsters and then CELEBRATED THEIR MONSTROSITY. This green little token achiever cannot undo the RAGE and the HATRED created last year. This crap makes me sick.
üÜò Senile incompetent Joe Biden our new fraudulent fake president, that is in bed with China who gave the world the Chinese coronavirus and terrorist sponsor Iran, who wants to wipe the USA and Israel off the map. God help us all.
I'm glad for my fraudulent president, and it wouldn't be the worst to wipe the usa out, and no one cares about Israel unless you are from there
source: trust me bro
I'm not American, I'm European. I've questioned America's sanity for the last four years. But when I see young strong Americans, showing their love and passion for their country, I remember why America once had the appeal of a land of promise.
"...for there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it...if only we are brave enough to be it." - mic drops üé§ü•≤... 5:22

stupid quote
@Maiva üòÇ cool story bro üëç
@Salty Gorilla you‚Äôre literally triggered by the fact that a black woman who was reciting a poem was called a queen. people are called a king or a queen based off of what they say or do, not because of race. you‚Äôre contradicting yourself and you just made this whole thing about race. again, you sound dumb lol
@Denise you are the one making the claims, the burdon of proof is on you baby girl üòÇüòò
@Denise send the links denice.. if you're right it should be easy... Just send the links üòÇüòÇ I'm waiting baby girl üòò

@Denise you won't send the links tho, bc the only links to what you are saying are from cnn, msnbc, abc ect.. it's all propaganda baby girl üòòthey selling you lies üòÇüòÇ and you buying it up
@Salty Gorilla So there you go. Everything you wantedüòä Oh and for trump? Lol if convicted he can never run for an official position again! Fingers crossedü§ûüèΩ‚ú®
@Denise you gonna have to stay ignorant lil girl üòÇ you are reciting propaganda pushed by left wing media. None of it is based in fact, send the links if it is fact.. I'm waiting
@Salty Gorilla Salty girl, these aren‚Äôt accusations. Check the arrest records. I know you have a small brain, but it takes a simple google search.
@Salty Gorilla The Trump Rioters said ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Äù but killed a police officer, killed some of themselves, left a bomb, stole and destroyed federal property bc they were mad about the election... they did all that and changed nothing.
@Denise send the links to support your accusations.. I'm waiting üòÇ
@Salty Gorilla but you‚Äôre brain is so small you can‚Äôt grasp that lmao... you literally mad i said i enjoyed some poetry. You gonna have to stay mad, salty girl.
@Salty Gorilla But you‚Äôre bringing up Trump, Trump riots and BLM up over poetry because you‚Äôre mad... lmaooo My original comment wasn‚Äôt even to YOU and was about poetry
@Salty Gorilla i mean you can easily find arrest records and articles of white supremacist causing that in the peaceful BLM protests. It takes a simple search lol
@Denise you can't dispute the facts I'm presenting üòÇthat lets me know you know it's the truth üòò
@Denise üòÇ I presented facts, blm is responsible for billions in property damage and at least 47 deaths. You don't dare dispute it tho lol bc there is no possible defense. You just change the subject üòÇ I'm still curious, what exactly will Trump be convicted on? üòÇ No response to that either, ok simple minded sweetheart üòò you keep buying that propaganda they sell you
@Salty Gorilla Salty girl, you @‚Äòd me with incorrect information and I corrected you. I clearly upset you and struck a nerveüòä. You can argue with yourself like you have been. It shows how bitter you are that we are enjoying ourselves  you can‚Äôt change that. üòÇ God bless your small brain. Prayers to you my bitter darling. üíñ
@Denise ¬†what a beautiful talented King Donald Trump is üíØ He made history ‚úäüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
@Denise üòÜ finally, something somewhat original lmao. What will Trump be convicted of exactly? üòÇ he clearly denounced the violence at the Capitol. Unlike every democrat when blm caused billions in property damage and 47 deaths... üòÇ I'm curious what your defense will be for that haha!?
@Salty Gorilla Aww You‚Äôre so sadü•∫ Stay crying and miserable, especially while we enjoy this beautiful poetry from this Queen. üòò Trump is gone babes. His trial begins February 9th, see you there salty girl üíô Bye bye now. üíï

@Salty Gorilla Perfect name you‚Äôre so saltyüòÇ cry somewhere else, salty. üíñ
@Maiva when was the last time a white woman was referred to as queen just for reciting a poem? Lmao it wasn't bc of her words. I didn't make it about race, just called it out, and that triggered you üòÜ
@Salty Gorilla you sound so dumb. people call her a queen not because of her skin color but because of her words. stop making everything about race
@Denise have fun reporting people's comments and liking your own comments üòÜüëã
@Salty Gorilla go cry somewhere else, salty. üíñ
@Denise millions of others? I don't think so denice, the video got more down votes than likes üëéüòÜ
@Lucy Ren√©e It was a mic drop to me  millions of others. ü§ó I throughly enjoyed it. She‚Äôs so great. üòå
Correct! It was definitely not a mic drop, none of the poem that was. She‚Äôs simply looking very nice and neat. Her skin is lovely and her hand movements almost like a dancer‚Äôs or sign language interpreter‚Äôs. There was nothing moving in that speech for most ADOS (American Descendants of Slaves) Blacks/Americans who have gone through hell in the US. She‚Äôs no young Lauryn Hill or Tamika Mallory. Those two spoke truth to power. They didn‚Äôt tread lightly with some word salad in order to please those in power or seduce the masses with the idea that there is unity after what happened at the Capital on the 6th. As Yvette Carnell said, ‚ÄúUnity without accountability is oppression.‚Äù There can be no ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù or unity without acknowledgement. Biden and his vp need to seriously address a number of things instead of sweeping them under American‚Äôs filthy and raggedy rug.
Soothing words for the people who destroyed tens of thousands of businesses last year. From the pulpit in front of the Capitol, the tens of thousands of people who rioted, vandalised and intimidated the public hear words to soothe their troubled conscience, and give them absolution. Because grandma would understand them now. After all, if there is no justice, there is to be no peace. And this attitude prevails in a country thick with laws! From the young poet, America gets a 'C' grade. It barely passes. The nation is still in a position though to lift itself up and now do what is right. Though so far, America has been a naughty, vile at times, and selfish child. Can do better. Must do better.
@stallone123 In the UK they say King and Queen bc they are referring to a legitimate King or Queen of the country. In the comment, el dum dum is referring to an apparent poem writer as a Queen, presumably bc of her skin color üòÇüòÇ
@Julius Seizure wtf do you know about a little black girl's experiences? You couldn't even begin to comprehend.
@Salty Gorilla I‚Äôm pretty sure all people were calling white people kings and queens until America had its revolution from England. She has every right to support another woman, unlike you who has to come on this positive thread and act like a jealous child.
@Julius Seizure do it better then.
@Salty GorillaWhen we sang God Save the Queen? What's your point?
@Salty Gorilla You meant her majesty in London?
@Salty Gorilla Hey, Mayor McDouchebag! Let people like the poem! Do you really need to make this about race? Go away.
That was one of my favorite lines from her poem
@Julius Seizure wow, what a mic drop!
@electrikblue1008 Your English teacher would be very disappointed right now. And don't forget the pretentious and exaggerated gestures she makes. Other than that, she's adorable. Who's a good social commentator?
@Julius Seizure funny that now you claim you are criticizing her words due to lack of experience (when you don't know anything about her experiences) but narrow down your comment to being unimpressed by her use of a "pun" that was never there to begin with. Someone make it make sense...
@electrikblue1008 Still not the mic drop you think it is. And no, that was definitely a corny pun.
@Julius Seizure basic grammar is part of basic education, is it not? You still used pun incorrectly lol üòÖ
@electrikblue1008 Lmao I know it hurts your head to process some nuance but learn what that is before you argue over semantics. Basic grammar has failed you. I'm criticizing the words of a 22 year old who hasn't even experience much of what she's talking about. Her next poem would be authentic if she talks about tokenism and privilege. Sit down, you sound ignorant.
@Julius Seizure learn what a pun is, or the very least google it before you start coming for people. Basic education has failed you, yet you're out here criticizing the words of an educated young poet. Sit down, you sound stupid.
Could not agree more! Cheers from Indonesia.
@Julius Seizure it...it was word play... In a poem, so not a pun. A pun implies a comedic aspect.
@Julius Seizure üòÇüòÇ yep. Gotta praise poc to be socially accepted in Biden's America
Really? A pun impressed you? An overused pun that wasn't that clever to begin with? Okay.
When is the last time you referred to a white person as king or queen?
AMEN
Yes that part!
Brilliant, hopeful, powerful
Amanda Gorman, thank you, you are such a blessing. You have such wisdom :) Love you.
She is too flowery. To much hand movements. I was glad she was finish and got off stage.
@Tony swe , u understand.
I loathe roses too, all those petals, layers and layers of them. So annoying. (Edited to add this was sarcasm).
it's called "interpretation", shes just feeling what she wrote
Agree 100%
Respect how Amanda simply appeared on stage and then quietly exited with grace and completely devoid of fanfare. However, her words and inspiration will live forever deeply etched in our souls and on the same steps where a 14 days prior, ignorance and hate failed to change our lives. Amanda - you are a hero.
Proves that no one under the age of 21 should have the vote.
@d t So I have to raise the bar to 26, when human brains are fully formed, according to scientists. No problem. She should be embarrassed to offer such tripe at her age.
That is a bs statement. Good thing she's 23
@Z_ViET FR. Absurdly understandable. Since Plato's "Republic" only The Founders dared to create a Constitutional Republic ordained to serve the People and not itself. If you surrender that Greatest Dream, then you are more foolish than the MOB!
We need a million more young minds like hers. Instead of narcissistic ass shaking Tik Tok-ers... We need more young people who care about the future for all of us, not just what's right in front of them.
You didn't understand a single word. Be the light, not the shade.
Well... now I'm crying. How incredible! This is America at its best.
Beautifully rendered! Ms. Gorman's poetry reflects hope, truth, and love. Her poem brought tears to my eyes, as did President Biden's speech. May we all find our way to a more perfect, just, and harmonious union. Unfortunately, at least one comment on this thread lets me know that the horrific and fear-filled birther movement continues. Vice President Kamala Harris was born at Kaiser Hospital (3701 Broadway Blvd.) in Oakland, California. For those in need of further assurances to soothe their troubled spirits, read the biographical material provided: https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/15032442523
This kid knows NOTHING. Token black.
What a beautiful poem articulated so eloquently by a brilliant young lady.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üíôüíôüëèüëè
Well that was awesome.
What a POWERFUL word this young sister has dropped in the heart of the spirit of our nation!! I pray that we'll hold fast to hope and be guided by the POWER of TMH as we go forward as a nation!!!üíïüíØ
I cried throughout most of this poem, and I‚Äôm a 42 year old white guy....
@thehoneydeev üíûüòÇüíû
I cried too.
@Willy Wonka That's nice to hear. If more black and white people shed enough tears, the hard wall of fear, misunderstanding, ignorance, and pain that divides us would soften and fall, so that we could finally walk into each other's hearts. Keep crying. ‚ù§üôè‚ù§
I am sure we all did . , such powerful words
I‚Äôm with you my brother. I‚Äôm black and cried. It goes to show our humanity will always prevail the division
You are not whiteüôÇ. Neither is she black my friendüôÇüòÄ. We are simply all of us human beingü•∞ü§©... I watched and was enthralled with her eloquence and dexterity.... much love all the way... Peace‚úäüëäüôè
I did too. Watching from the Caribbean. So powerful.
Wonder how Fox news will rip apart this woman's speech.
It‚Äôs not a speech. She is the Poet Laureate.
‚Äúa nation, that isn‚Äôt broken, but simply unfinished.‚Äù damn
‚Äã@Yael Chavah Yisra'el I really like that last line, you're clever. Just since you're so curious as to wonder, I have had large audiences applaud me on occasion.. and c'mon now, just because she was deemed suitable by 'someone' doesn't mean she should be doing it. I've heard more than one persons who was deemed suitable to sing the national anthem, for example. You have your opinion, I have mine. Or is this a last word thing we've got goin' now :)
@Big Fire Pop LOL! Her poetry was obviously deemed suitable for the inauguration otherwise she would not have been asked to deliver it! Oh, did you notice how she received a standing ovation including the president-elect? I doubt anyone clapped for anything you had to say lol!
@Jeffrey Hinkel More nonsense coming from you? Look, those so called nucleus families were a bunch of infidels who bred racist idiots and monsters like Jeffrey Dahmer!
@Yael Chavah Yisra'el ;,( aw such a personal attack.. so sad now. it's your own opinion to think this is poetry worthy of a president's inauguration /shrug
@Jeffrey Hinkel Her speech was centered around a better America; Apparently it didn't resonate with you and just flew right over your head. Your comment is nothing but rubbish.
@Luis Medrano What's interesting is that you capitalized his name even though he didn't; he knows he's a loser so he's doing what losers do--put down others. If one is empty and devoid of uplifting others we have to consider the source.
@Big Fire Pop You wouldn't have her eloquence in your dreams!! LMAO! You're pathetic.
@MJM What?
@Chad Leach I so disagree! What platitudes? She mostly spoke about our nation and we as a people not the one to be sworn in. You need to listen again!
@Chuck I mean real d e e p
@A Jones so how is this biden feller working out for you suckers ?! ü§£ü§£ü§£
@Mercurial Pierrot The country was founded on the Constitution, read it and then you might understand the founding better.
Nah, it's not broken nor unfinished. This nation was founded on war and Imperialism. It's the way the founding fathers wanted it to be...they weren't saints, you know?
@V k And Biden isn't lying every time he opens his mouth? And Biden isn't going senile? And Biden and his family aren't the most corrupt family to be President is recent decades?
And the insane comments berating a young woman because they fell for the lies of a very flawed president proves that line right even more.
@patrick sapanaro All the black communities got from BLM is burned down cities and a bad reputation. BLM is a Marxist organization with a "we're for blacks" slogan.
@Luis Medrano malcolm X said a white liberal is the worst thing for america but worse for the black man. You dont know anything about anything. You've been punked by the democratic party.
@Christopher exactly the Democrats had everyone by the balls having everyone believe there lies and only be willing to help out only transgenders.
@patrick sapanaro nothing.
@Encore Baby Your response reeks of white supremacy and elitism. The history of empires is public knowledge. You point to barbaric pasts to defend modern actions of euro cultures. That‚Äôs a strawman tactic and doesn‚Äôt justify anything at all. I‚Äôd like you to evaluate what White supremacy means to you and your relation to it
How much did black communities get from the 90 million dollars donated to BLM?
The only good line in the poem, however, the left doesn't want to finish the nation, they want to destroy it and remake it.
@witch, please Biden will fail so bad in the end, those words you're going wish you never said.
@1995hss How is saying that USA is unfinished American exceptionalism? All countries are unfinished, but this wasn't the inauguration of the president of "all countries" but the USA.
Sounds like classic communist revolution talk - always the same - not taking away from the rest of it though
It is a broken nation... she got that completely wrong. The Democrats are breaking it.
This nation is absolutely broken. In the trash heap. Absolutely no unity, thanks to fraud biden.
Yea...well said...
‚úåüèª
Definitely not "broken". It was BUILT this way - to be CORRUPT...and oppressive AF for ADOS.
yep and old Joe will finish it off that is for sure, he already signed away about 20 million jobs
@Germangirl don't vote yeah I was just pretending to have Covid last week. Laying in bed with a 100 degree fever and getting a professional diagnosis that I had the coronavirus was just an act, haha! No. Get your head out of your ass, not everything is a conspiracy to ‚Äúoppress‚Äù you.
@Encore Baby white people crying about racism in 2021, after the benefitting from the world they rigged for hundreds of years, will be the craziest memory of this century no doubt.
@Encore Baby sir reverse racism does not exist
@Encore Baby and you can keep thinking the reason certain people dont accept people like the obamas, Kamala Harris, and Amanda Gorman has nothing to do with their skin color. Must be nice to live in that fantasy
@Encore Baby the slander is hardly constructive criticism. it has no reasoning other than contempt
@Jeffrey Hinkel "...they clearly don't care about white males." Oh. My. God. Did you just say that? You sorry old victim! Are your feelings hurt, Jeff? Not feeling cared for? Your privilege is breathtaking. Why don't you start a white male therapy group where you can all sit down and support each other. You can complain about how you're feeling as if black folk are getting too 'lippy' these days. I'd love to know what the world would look like to you if people DID 'care about white males...' What would that look like? Not that I really care. I love the fact that a disillusioned racist like you us feeling unloved. Progress.
@UzuMaki NaRuto Yes, that's poetry. Just because you don't understand it, you mock it. "But it doesn't rhyme!" üòÇ
When would it ever possibly be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù? ‚ÄòBroken‚Äô bones heal, ‚Äòbroken‚Äô things can be mended. Finally ‚Äòbroken‚Äô things can be made into something new, something better.
@Abu Lahab The time for that nonsense is OVER. Trump and his slavish, cult followers LOST in spite of all the lies that were told. You honestly believe that Hunter Biden - who apparently has millions of dollars - took his laptop to a legally blind, suburban PC repairer in another state and that blind PC repairer just happened to know Rudy Giuliani? You believe that? Well, even FOX NEWS didn't believe it! ZERO EVIDENCE, SSME AS ELECTION FRAUD CLAIMS. Intellectual cripples like you make me laugh! üòÇ
@MJM You didn't understand it, we know. God, you SO OBVIOUS. You're like the bully at school who mocks the smart kids because he can't read.
@1995hss Every country has these sorts of messages during leadership milestones. I hate the false patriotism of many Americans but this is appropriate, especially in the context of the events of the last 16 days.
@Encore Baby the multitude of people who degrade her, belittle her talent, and find her unworthy of her accolades
@Encore Baby look at this comment section to know that she‚Äôs not accepted
If we dig we fig if we lie we tie if we dare we flare....the flame. Lol üòÇ
Take it easy
@Luis Medrano: Damn is right, 'mijo. It's a damn shame that so many people participate in cheating and this lie of a Presidency. It's a damn shame that YouTube continues to gaslight us by putting the statement that Gropin' Joe is the POTUS when we know that is not the case.
She's is African American, she is smart, peaceful that why she is not accepted in America
@Oni Jin empty words lol
@Kamaka Alameda lmao!! You just made my point! If people don't agree with your view, they must be a white racist that love their White Privilege. One might say the racist could be you for assuming I am a white man to begin with. For the record I fall in the minority group not that it makes a difference. I get up and work hard everyday putting in 70-80 hours a week to give me and my family a better life. No oppression and no handouts needed here, nor do I feel the need for someone to understand my feelings or walk in my shoes. What I have had, is a clear understanding that if I make a child, I should look after them and provide, not just financially but mentally so they don't grow up thinking everyone owes them something they haven't earned simply because of the color of their skin. But you never did address why BLM would be specifically against the nuclear family structure. How can having a mother and father in the home raising the child or children they decided to make is a bad thing?
@Big Fire Pop Just is is not JUSTICE. I thought it was a pretty clever word play
@Bunter Hiden Sounds like you care, sounds like you are threatened by someone who has achived more in 20 minutes then you will in your life.
@mnztr1 Oh yes I am so threatened. I don't care either way. Just sick of the pandering and fawning like sycophants.
@Manny B you are missing the oppression part and caused and reactions to oppression. As a white man you don‚Äôt get the issues or don‚Äôt want to look at them simply because you like your Privilege. Your viewpoint is absolutely archaic in design and perpetuates prejudice and racism!
@Luis Medrano Well, her "poetry" sucks.
The words of a fool! Most Americans agree that the election was stolen .
@ThatGirl your right, I'm done reacting to these people. I sound as bad as they do!
@laura hoshaw She made references to what she research but not stated any real sources of her plagiarism.
Amanda Gorman is a racist !
‚Äã@Encore Baby what do you mean specifically by "the political ideology"
‚Äã@Germangirl don't vote get on meds ASAP
@John Smith I saw her in an interview right after the reading talking about researching lincoln, king, etc... and what words they used during times of division in this country. One of the lines she got from a person on Twitter... but as usual, you didn't bother looking for the answers. that's pretty typical nowadays. she gives me hope... folks like you make me want to buy a rugar.
No Nations in the entire world are Finished. All Nations are ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù because all nations keeps changing, adding up to what it was to comply with society progressives, changing!
She said ‚Äújust is is not justice‚Äù
@Bunter Hiden I am not, I am admiring her performance and I am not threathened by the fact she is black or female, unlike you.
Sounds like south africa. Ironically, south africa really is broken now.
@mnztr1 stop worshiping people for their gender, sexuality and/or skin color
@Kyle from AxeTruth so true lmao
we've been teaching this to kids forever.... we teach them that America is a delicate experiment and needs constant protection, maintenance and flexibility. we teach them that the future is inclusive, and a rainbow of differences... we urge them to serve, to seek to be stewards of this delicate democracy...and when they rise up, they bloom exactly like THIS.... Amanda Gorman is the next generation. the one rational people Always want. those who want to take us backward, are Not lovers of the country in which they live, they stand as walls against progress and must be marginalized by the sound of hope and change over take their hatred and aggression.
The Holy Word of God - The Bible: John 3 : 16 - 21 _"16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."_
@Kamaka Alameda so unless you walk in someone else's shoes, you are somehow what? When was the last time you heard a Japanese person ask for a hand out or anything from the government or pitty from anyone. Don't forget what was done to them after Pearl Harbor. Every ethnic group has gone through alot at one point or another in the course of history. As for Black Lives Matter Inc. It's a farse and everyone with a brain knows it. If you're black and don't agree with them, then your life doesn't matter. Why is it that they advocate against the nuclear family structure when decades of history show that this is the issue that directly impacts the life of a young child the most regardless of your race. BLM inc is nothing more than a Marxcist organization that uses those in less fortunant circumstances and prays on them to make them think that they are owed something for what they have not been a part of from someone who had nothing to do with it.
@KalypsoKRUZüåª Oh yeah she did claim she wrote it. Keep up with the times! Interview with Anderson Cooper.
@John Smith Firstly, she didn‚Äôt claim she wrote it. It‚Äôs plagiarism when one CLAIMS it as theirs. Also, y‚Äôall need to SHOW CREDIBLE PROOF instead of making claims that she didn‚Äôt write. Y‚Äôall so inane  immature af!
@Jeffrey Hinkel tf is you talking about?!!!!!! You making up sh*t. That‚Äôs all y‚Äôall do is LIE.
@laura hoshaw No she didn't!
@Mark Mandel no doubt, you're right. In that sense it was also almost as forgettable.
@Bunter Hiden stop acting like a frightened child.
@Abu Lahab he was tied up....
@Jeffrey Hinkel Ugh again the ignorance. You either actually know what the statement means and youre being intentionally argumentative or you're ignorant and if so evet google any in depth article on the movement just you know to be educated? Wait I know you want..it signifies theyre being killed at a disproportionate rate and therefore Hey their lives matter too!
@John Smith she publicly named parts of the poetry that came from other sources. research before you speak.
@Jeffrey Hinkel huh 60? too bad you act like an ignorant pre-teen
I think it's a reference to a speech by Martin Luther King.
Yeah and by that she means black supremacy
Yes that line was incredibly wise and BRILLIANT!!
@A Rodriguezdice ‚Äúuna nacion, que no esta quebrada, pero simplemente inacabada‚Äù
@Gar Sm I guess since Biden did it so often they thought plagiarism was an accepted activity.
Luis, puedo tener una traducci√≥n de esas palabras?
@afro hammite01 What are you talking about you fool
@afro hammite01 and what then? Nothing never change from then on? In demographic.
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE. 20 YRS IT WI BE FINISH.
@Big Fire Pop doubt you could make anything better lmao.
@Luis Medrano im not American you idiot. And what if im not white? Then what, im racists to. Or then my thoughts is all right, and even interesting? Beside im just making point all nations is in constant change( all leftist will agree) if that so, how it can be finished or broken. There for unfinished to is impossible.
Disgusting display of a parade.Instead of putting a fake facade on and deceive the American people making everything seem glamorous while this Rich politicians living mansions we at the bottom fighting for toilet paper no thank you . The Covid lie was the cherry on top of the whipped cream. Enjoy your day looking at a lady talking with a yellow jacket and the red Hairband while people have been deceived into believing we are in a pandemic and killed that way .ENJOY YOUR GLAMOROUS SHOW AMERICA
It is broken now. You will see!
@Kar Kan hey, you‚Äôre missing one more K in your name there
@Luis Medrano whats it got to do with color you racist
If is everything in constant flux, how can nation or something else, by finished or unfinished? Naive child...
@Jeffrey Hinkel I will surely forget your forefathers; thanks for the que!
I know, right!!!
@Jeffrey Hinkel White males need to stop whining like pre-teen girls and grow a pair.
@Chad Leach How unhappy are you.
@guillotine garvez I do believe you are referring to Melania. She plagiarized the whole speech, go figure!
@John Smith you mean like how ivanka did üòÇ
Strange since she didn't write that. That is a very old statement long before her. She plagiarized the quote" unfinished nation!
@Jeffrey Hinkel you'll probably be gone before next election anyway crypt keeper üòÇüòÇüòÇüíÅüèø
@Jeffrey Hinkel you're 60 you won't even be ü§¶üèø never mind üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@MJM you must be another ruthless cult member üëπüí©üí©üí©
@MJM Jealousy is a sin.
@Jeffrey Hinkel He did fail. And he was booted out because he‚Äôs a failure. He lost his temper multiple times, what are you talking about?? Lol his [former] tweets were his rants, whining like a petulant child that got his toys taken away from him. Then he lost, and he whined even more. He‚Äôs a degenerate who was never fit for that office. A bigot, a racist, a sexist, a narcissist, a PERPETUAL LIAR, and a charlatan. Hopefully Biden can restore some class, truth and honor to the office. We‚Äôll chastise him when he messes up, and we‚Äôll congratulate him when he gets things right. Just enjoy this amazing poem, by this amazing young woman Jeff.
@MJM yea it was. If you didn‚Äôt feel that than you are not American
That Deep
@Jeffrey Hinkel you can do a lot about it! You can vote! You can March! You can proudly proclaim that Black Lives Matter ‚úäüèø because obviously we know that white lives matter. The other thing is the generation that hold the most racist which is yours hopefully will die off soon and their children who are far more educated will rise!
@Jeffrey Hinkel you don‚Äôt walk in the shoes of a person of color so you don‚Äôt understand. I myself am part native Hawaiian and Portuguese and trust me when I say this... my Hawaiian side experienced extreme prejudice because of their race! I myself am somewhat passable as white and understand That privilege. Instead of feeling like people of color hate you maybe join them! March with them. Hear their stories hear their truth! Drive through their communities! White people have done horrific things to people of color and yet all people of color want is equal opportunity. To stand in the way of that is to be racist!
@Jeffrey Hinkel it‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt get that in order to understand the present we have to reflect on the past. Those who have white Privilege would like us to forget about the past yet it is the reason why brown and black people Continue to be oppressed. There are people in this country who‚Äôs grandparents where slaves and you can‚Äôt tell me that they have not been effected.
Peace be with you
This is one of beautiful speech I‚Äôve ever heard aside from Balian speech from the movie Kingdom of Heaven and Chaucer‚Äôs speech introducing Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein in A Knights Tale.
@milada bravenec - nothing wrong with Russians. Just that paid Russian trolls would feel better than our own neighbors being trolls. (It was just a joke. Cheers!)
She Drop those words
@Abu Lahab move around
@Abu Lahab lol you are so useless.
@Chris Rogers what‚Äôs wrong with Russians??
@bill barry you have no clue what racism really is, nor do you likely do anything to fight it Bill
@MJM it was to most of us do don't get bothered because we embraced her. You are a minority here.
@Luis Medrano That's 'poetry'?! Ok.
I heard her say that earlier and tried to hear it again but I couldn‚Äôt. That is the best line of all. Thank you for pointing that out again to me. This young lady has a lot together!
@Abu Lahab OMG what a load of horse crap. Evidence, or it's false!
@Big Fire Pop that was "just is"
@Aberd Where‚Äôs Hunter?
ü§Æ
@Aberd thank you, I thought I missed something there...there are always fools.
This young woman is everything that we all should aspire to be! She‚Äôs amazing ü§©
Trolls all through here. I only wish they were Russian and not actual Americans.
@Aberd I know when Someone has been walking around in B.S. and Chinese biden..has been doing it for decades, And I can't even say what Heels up Harris's feet have Have been doing...cause Its disgusting.
I know, couldn't believe she came up with such a stupid line. But then I remembered she just got finished rhyming "just his" with "justice" ugh ü§Æ
@Aberd He's literally blurting out the 3 lines that these idiots have. It's always the same...exact...crap. Such a troll.
@Chuck where is hating gonna get you? No where so sit down. She‚Äôs absolutely right.
@MJM Your failed president lost, get over it.
Lmao was that impressive to you
@1995hss I honestly didn't get the 'American exceptionalism' message. This wasn't a comparison with other countries. I think this was just about US and our capabilities. I got that deep down, we know that we can do this. We CAN do this. Intestinal fortitude. We got this.
American exceptionalism, how brave
@Chad Leach this video is about a black woman‚Äôs poetry, not a white man‚Äôs speech.
@Chad Leach WTF are you talking about? didn't you even watch and actually listen to the video? or are you just a tRump troll.
Are just platitudes spoken of a man whos been in politics for nearly 50 years and helped lead this nation to its most divided point since the Civil war.
sO deEp

@Barbara Young oh Barbara how wrong you joe Stalin fans are
@idk what im doing here I see focus on the light, (hmm marijuana must be legal in your state)
@Maria Rogers No I am not. I have never used a marijuana or any other drug in my life. Quite the opposite, I am educated, reasonable, compassionate, kind, strong, vigorous, and discriminating. I have penetrating insight. I have made mistakes of course, but realizing the harm that Trump and his cult have accomplished isn't one of them.
@Jeffrey Walker wait are you that stoner guy jerry Jeff walker

What a poem, and who is this POET? No words to express how wonderful I think she is.
These comments are legitimately nauseating
This is deep! Well executed my little sister.
That was beautiful. Now if only the Biden administration can live up to those words, instead of just becoming another "business as usual" oligarchic administration.
Brilliant!!!
I saw this girl in the crowds leading up the the speaches and was like "Who is that?" Now I know. What a beautiful girl, and a beautiful mind.
Somewhere Maya Angelou is smiling.

‚ÄúThe new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light if only we are brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to be it.‚Äù -Amanda Gorman‚Äôs The Hill We Climb. Beautifully said üëèüèΩ
Video
Amazing. Brought tears of joy to my eyes.
Wow. Halfway through her words beat me at every sentence and evoked emotions that swelled up in remembrance of what we've been through. Thank you.
Started to cry 40 sec
"We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms." Nah, I have a holster.
@d t üòÇ the internet is just too much.
@Jeffrey Walker sure am. Can teach them how to aim when someone who doesn't possess, nor cares to, those qualities comes kicking in their door at 3am instead of a job as a means of financial acquirement. Can also teach small children to use pepper spray when certain creeps wanna sniff them.
@The Darkness Came Oh indeed you are capable of great violence, armed and dangerous. Are you capable of compassion, understanding, helpfulness, gentleness, wisdom that you can pass on to small children, things that represent true strength unaccompanied by swagger and threat?
@The Darkness Came would it shatter your ego if they took away your holster? I'm not trying to sound like a bisch, im honesty asking
@d t Godlike, actually. Thanks for asking.
@yeagerist History has defined it many times before.
@Painted Pony You should be nice to bots, they'll be taking your job while government decides to leave you hanging for a stimulus check. üòâ
@Jeffrey Walker if you call 6 foot 240 tiny, sure.
Troll bot
u missed the message
What a vicious reply. You have to carry a weapon to feel something other than tiny.
Feel special or something?
Truly historic! I‚Äôm glad I got to see this!
What a pompous load of bull Schiff. Stilted delivery, too. Must. you. inhale. After. Every. Word. Like. A. Bird. And. Use. That. Absurd. Rhyming pattern? Makes me want to go gone. I'd rather hear Vogon Poetry. Yes. It has better........... Flowetry. Gack.

Amazing Poem. She is going to go very far in this world.
Going to? Check again!
Anybody else hear @AbaandPreach ?
LOVE  UNITY
Racist fascist pedo fake-pres-Biden.
1k dislikes! Let me guess? The fringes of unpatriotic Americans. Amanda Gorman, thank you for your contribution to society. Godspeed.
Simp
No the dislikes just haven't realized they to can " be it" so maybe we can give them room to come around.
Yeah, even one dislike is far too many on this Masterpiece
My thoughts too
1K dislikes from 1K Trump supporters
Imitation inauguration
I thought the same think @1K. Unfortunate
Also you look amazing : )
Mesmerised .. such well chosen words spoken with such confidence , grace and strength from one so young! üá∫üá∏
Brilliantly Eloquent!!
Raised by a single mother.
So strong, so composed, so hopeful and beautiful. Her poem (and its recitation) was my favorite part of the whole shebang!

Really i heard these one before alot of time who are you fooling
Thank you for your words and message!
Phenomenal
The world is listening! No more lies! Kind regards from europe.
@Brooke Lefort You are talking nonsense, in Germany we have "obamacare" since 1863. Everyone pays contribution.
@Brooke Lefort That's the norm in Europe and so many places in the world. US still blind by the money, the rest of the world try to make more fair, more just, less violent

Wow, such beautiful sentiments and poetry on your part. So dedicated to the preservation of anti-communist ideals like seeing them in every corner, in all walks of life, in reincarnated Hugo Chavez, in all democrats, in all possible ideals opposed to fascism. Heil Lucky Clover.
WoW! Great speech or poem or whatever you want to call it. Well delivered. I'm thankful for her words üôè.
I understood those Hamilton references ‚òùÔ∏è
Who the heck is this little piece of token propaganda? Perhaps a direct descendant of Kharmalita's slave-owning Grandpappy? Biden did not even manage to produce a genuine poet for this historical "landmark" event. Never had time time to read any good poetry on the Amtrack because he was too preoccupied with the contents of Hunter's laptop? Just askin'.
nah you guys support insurrection, terrorism, and strangling/gunning down black people. absolutely no one on the planet respects your sick ideas.
@William Schutter no only you and the loony supporters care. And why didn't you care w/everything trump has done wrong? Or are you just hypocritical?
@d t So wrong. Anyone who is moral, concerned for the Rule of Law, and opposed to Biden corruption does care. Conscience and integrity still matter to many, thank God.
No one cares what is on hunters laptop
1K dislikes?!? Sadly this is why unfortunately we will never be truly United, the jackasses out there will never embrace honor, respect and love for one another. She is amazing.
What an incredible poem,  at such an apropos moment in our history! How this woman had the insight, courage  wherewithall to deliver this awesome poem at such a young age is nothing short of amazing! Thanks Amanda for giving us all hope in not just our youth, but, our future! Wow!
Sheesh in all that darkness she is a freaking bright light! That was profound and truly embodies all that has occurred. Simply great!
Beautiful! üòò
wow wow TOP TOP TOP
895 hate filled folks that need love spilled upon them - brothers and sisters WE ARE UNITED despite those few that can't see the light.
Beautiful in every way.
Good Writer! It is unfortunate that the Art is currently obstructed by the polarization of political propaganda. I am convinced that half the country is going to believe they were called a destructive force attempting to stop democracy, and that "might with right" means all those people who disagree need to be destroyed... Not very healing I would imagine.
Now we assert,‚Äù how can catastrophe possibly prevail over us‚Äù. Well said young lady
Most blacks dont give a sh!t about Kamala and Obama. Im one of them. TRUMP 2021

I am so proud of you Amanda I am not watching the festivities live, but will watch later when I am in the right frame of mind Lady Gaga song our National Anthem too distraught nevertheless, I am praying for peace and a strong unified team.

Wahoo what an intelligent youth showering blessings words to the whole world youths God bless United States love from a humble Kenyan.
I wonder if the Left knows it's okay to have someone other than a black person do things these days? I guess this was supposed to be another one of those historical moments. "First black, female, 22 year old poet laureate".
And, Warren, unlike you she is gifted. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs up there today and you will never be.
Spoken like a true racist.
Let me see: Lady Gaga sang, Jennifer Lopez sang, Garth Brooks sang and Amanda Gorman recited a poem and all you can bring up is her colour?
BULL CRAP FRAUDDDDDDDD
I'm so happy if it was fraud
Amazing üëèüëè
I was completed captured by her poem. IMO this poem is the right message at the right time and for the right reasons
What a great day for China and the CCP!!
A young light glowing brighter in America
Robert Frost. Maya Angelou. The greats are in good company with Amanda Gorman.
Amazing
Very well spoken üíï
I guess I was kind of with her until the hawk-whistles .......can I say hawk-whistles....? ..does that scan......? .......I'm sticking with it No, I don't think a country needs to be "fierce" nor to focus on "might" The ecosystem is shifting under the weight of our species, we occupy every country on the planet, we're being aloof about the propagation and mutation of a novel viral strain throughout nearly our entire species, we just increased our military budget during a PANdemic, we spend trillions on planes that don't fly, most of our "defense budget" seems to mystically "get lost" anyway [ya know, going into people's pockets, and get funneled into tacitly terrible investments which are then buried after never making returns], we nearly exterminated the entire american indian population and their culture, we just banned a religion from entering our country [whatever that means........], we have children in cages, we tear gassed literal lines of moms, we're calling BLM terrorists, we're toying around with global warfare during ecological shifts and PANdemics, - .............................. I'd like a little less "fierce might" in my breakfast cereal today, thanks, hun. Maybe we can focus on just BEING SOMBER AND FOCUSED ON THE 14,000 TIME-SENSATIVE ISSUES WHICH DEMAND ACTION instead of taking time out to make sure we "mix fierce might" into our cauldron There are actual genocides and atrocities happening right now, never mind that WE'RE DECAYING THE ECOSYSTEM WHICH KEEPS US ALL ALIVE Maybe keep "all that might" locked away for a while, and focus on healing, rebuilding, planning, learning, educating, uniting, and so on I have such a hard time with people who look around right now and think "this world really needs a little more human might" I am in opposition to you if you maintain that stance Human might is destroying human life and having a go at literally everything else Maybe leave the "fierce might" in the pantry for a while
Oh my goodness. These words of hers were just what we needed. Thank you beautiful lady.
Brilliant. Such a young , great talent . Well articulated. You go girl.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It's really funny to think that almost a thousand people watched this video and thought. "Yeah, this is problematic."
The rap of democracy. Uhh rahh!
Whether you call this a speech or a poem... it was beautiful, powerful perfection. She has an amazing talent and a bright future ahead of her. We haven't heard the last of her I'm sure.
üåûüíúü•∞
Amazing young women speech, that you can feel in your heart with HOPE and love for our country.. being honest with ourselves. To me, her words will always be imprinted in heart with faith and truth!
How inspiring! I am going to share with my students! Simply amazing!
The next Maya Angelou
I am inspired. Thank you,
I can't stand Joe Biden I'm not looking forward to the next four years but she really did a great job
If you are a Christian, the bible asks us to love our enemies. Just like you can't stand Biden there are people that may not even know you but hate you for no apparent reason. Trump, Biden or whoever else will come after they are not the savior. when we idolize a human been they become God to you, I think Trump has done some good work, but he is human, has also made many mistakes, but still sees himself as perfect. We need to forgive one another and move on from the division and hatred.
"...the norms and notions of what just is isn't always justice." Wow. She is absolutely amazing. I love her delivery as well as her words.
Blacks always think they're the victims but never mention about their behavior. I can't stand it.
They're always complain white folks don't treated them right. But what about Asian? I am sure white folks treated them better than Asian.
Of course they think they‚Äôre the victim when people like you seem to be under the impression that they behave differently than white people
Deeply moving! Stunning, powerful poem. Epic delivery! üòáüôèüôå
Now why am I crying??
Documenting struggle as a black yet claim victimhood as a black. Nothing new to see here folks.
Stolen presidency
Good
That outfit was as pristine as the poem itself
Mr. President why are gas prices soaring and you have not even been sworn in yet?
Lady Gaga sang, hope that clears it up.
This inspiringly articulate woman held the Nation and the world in her hands today. I sat on my sofa in Melbourne, Australia watching her speak to the world from the opposite side of the world and was humbled by the clarity with which she spoke and the way she captured the notion of being able to come together, wherever you are, and ALL be better versions of ourselves. Bravo Ms Gorman. You are surely going places and our world will be in better hands with the likes of you and your generation shining a great light on the path forward. Thank you

@Chad Leach I live in the US and had nothing to do with what's happening in Afghanistan!
@Yael Chavah Yisra'el and Bidens lost everything else....... glad your happy to strand people in Afghanistan but at least there's no more mean tweets lol.
@Vault Dweller Eight votes or 80 million votes didn't matter. The Most High God of the bible removed Trump from office. He was too much like Nebuchadnezzar! Trump would have destroyed this country because he was almost there!
@Chad Leach You know what TRUMP LOST TO BIDEN! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!
@Juliette Pierre That quote should be coined!
Hi dear
@Chad Leach hi dear
@Ginny K good day hope you are having a good day
@Denise hi dear
And screw Fox , I don't even watch tv or pay attention to the controlled media , Too much fake news , Did you just crawl out from under a rock , geez
@William Holt he is not a racist, get off the fox and ONA gravy train. Racism is running rampant in USA and previous person in the white house encouraged that divisiveness, over and over again. Current member is trying to re-unite all of haman kind, all humans equal and to be treated equal. The very fact that you saw it as a racist moves only reflects your own racism.
@Willett Mary Its a shame that it came on the heels of the Biden administration ,A racist himself Joe Biden , Lets face it , They placed a brilliant person , a composer, a poet , a speaker of color.out front for a reason , You know it and so do I , Not to take anything away from the young lady , why would I want to ?
@Kattywagon29 "Hope Kids have to study" Better words for kids to look into and study, . This is where the brainwashing starts . I had a dream too , This is NOT it , This is a progressive American Nightmare!

@Dorset Deb Racist boy
@John Woodsrd so millions and millions of dollars of property damaged innocent people‚Äôs lives completely destroyed and the deaths of over 20 people is worse then what happened at the Capitol. If you believe that you are a prime example of why this country is falling apart you are completely infected with political ideology to the point where truth and reality goes right over your head. I truly feel sorry for you I hope you wake up one day.
@bonnpoland really what do you think that line means?
You can‚Äôt repair the past it has already happened. You can learn from the past so you don‚Äôt repeat it. It‚Äôs painful that people think that quote is insightful it‚Äôs literally gibberish.
@Nathan Hatfield - so words that don‚Äôt fit your narrow and incomplete definitions don‚Äôt mean anything. Your logic is false on its face.
@Anne Cornish it will never begin. What would all those people do who depend on it never happening.
@Chris Rogers a hero like the people that have run into situations knowing they were going to die for a chance to save others lives or a hero like the word hero doesn‚Äôt mean anything if both people who give their lives to save others and people who write something you agree with over and over in the YouTube comment section are equivalent. Just curious what definition we are using.
You can‚Äôt repair the past. It‚Äôs the past.
@Julius Seizure Terrible effort. All you have managed to convey is that you're a butter racist. Her poem was fantastic.
@Denise Too bad i didnt hit a brain cell üòí
@Denise Why dont you enjoy your utopia on an island somewhere first? See how that works out for ya üòò
She said history has its eyes on us. Basically the future has taken a look at the current state of the world and giving us all a big side eye
@DaViiloW805 You‚Äôre making it VERY clear how miserable you are lmao
@Willett Mary Our brothers in Ore, yes, such Minerals . Just kidding, but yes.
It also they have forgotten the that with freedom come responsibility for all ore brothers and sisters.
@Blax Poitation Well the way I see it, Trump IS a fool. But what I mean by that is he is ultimately the one who reveals those who would attack the people for practicing reckless free speech. I think his words and actions were twisted a lot... for instance I HATED that he pulled out of the Paris Agreement but...it never occurred to me that it might just be a scam to drain money not to aid the environment. The policy itself however aptly named doesn‚Äôt do what it says. Tbh the public perception of Trump and his clownery is highlighted over the real change he‚Äôs done. He stood up to CCP which they treat their own people like garbage. No one talks about it but check out the channel Laowhy86 he lived in China for 10 years has videos on what it‚Äôs like to live under their reign. It‚Äôs real and the CCP being the backbone to the global economy everybody answers to them. Trump did not. He was called racist for it. EVERYTHING is perception. Why do we need news outlets to tell us how to perceive? Not WHAT to perceive...
@Halicarnassus83 no one who votes Democrat is a patriot. They hate the US. Everyone knows that. And Everyone Knows Biden cheated.
@Wnrc Ltv Versus those who voted for a President whom cannot even recite a Single quote from the Bible like Trump, yet his Antichrist "Christian" Treasonous CULT followers knelt at his feet and Wanted a Tyrant to RULE THEM. We, The Real American Patriots were tired of Your Ilk, and we voted him OUT. The REAL silent Majority.
@IDK anymore these people would vote for president someone who reads poems nicely.. Truly useful idiots
@Selena Mayfield ok shill
@KBS what does trump matter here? You can't seem to stop talking about him while a sitting potus, you yourself admit, needs to be investigated.
@Chad Leach I believe your worries are centered on Trump...excuse me if I am wrong. But, that cuts both ways. Biden is suspect also and investigation is required in that regard also.
@Tyler Bliss not hate or division, just fear and careful reflection. Until you face down the concerns of those you disagree with nothing will have been gained.
@K B do you really think Biden is going to go around killing 6 million innocent people for religious indifference? Take off the tin foil hat bud... its gonna be fine. Jesus.
@Chad Leach You're doing the exact opposite of the message she's trying to pound into the thick skulls of people like you... You just came here to comment and cause hate and division. Sad.
@Germangirl don't vote yet, here you are replying to HER comment. You sound fragile, love.
@keith mullens Nobody agrees with that bs üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@Aberd The underlying claim of collusion was proven false. Flynn was convicted of making false statements, not colluding with Russia. The media portrayed collusion as if it had merit, but it had about as much merit as a stolen election (not much) It was a conspiracy theory. I'm a registered democrat but the double standard is clear.
@DAVID TURCZAK Anti-black racist!
@IDK anymore I love how the second we disagree with you people, you call us communists. How? "We want to be equal," we say. What's wrong with that? Let's not sit here and act like America doesn't have a bad past. And KAMALA HARRID, A BLACK AND ASIAN WOMAN IS THE BUCE PRESIDENT.WE MADE HISTORY.Deal with itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∞
@Fredi Schwaaabe Have a good day. üíñ
@Vault Dweller Negative, I wouldn‚Äôt like that at all. I‚Äôd actually prefer to engage with someone who is reasonable. We may have a difference of opinion, but at least there‚Äôs sensible dialogue. And for the record, I‚Äôm not a Bill Maher fan like that. And I don‚Äôt hate trump or have a blind rage towards him. I think he was destructive and was NEVER fit for that office. I think he conned and brainwashed some people, and I believe he flirted with racism and fascism. He was a blight. He really brought out the worst in people, both his supporters and his opposers. But I‚Äôm more than willing to respectfully speak and listen to people who disagree with me.
@Dorset Deb It was your people storming the capital tearing down democracy, and for different reasoning too. Pointless political pursuits vs. civil rights. At least I get to laugh knowing you're on the wrong side of history.
@Denise they say a person that only sees the positive side is bound to fail (or stupid) tho yesterday was a day of hope for your defective country but realize that hope is a distraction from the huge fkn challenges you face be careful over there
@Germangirl don't vote Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üíñ
@Blax Poitation And yes. The entire political structure is corrupt AF. I mean the Federal Bank is not a branch of our government but they print ALL our money. We essentially OWE them. The Feds don‚Äôt owe anything to us. Theyre essentially just trying to get their money. Every dollar printed btw has interest on it. We forever indebted to the federal bank. These stimulus check for example are not free.
@Blax Poitation Dude. You‚Äôd like me so much to be the person Bill Maher told you I was ..well I‚Äôm not. I don‚Äôt care about Trump. I voted for Hilary in 2016. You are the one who wants to gamble with our democracy bc you hate trump that much. Blind rage
@Julius Seizure could you have made anything better? Or are we demeaning young ladies now because of a difference of opinion?
@UzuMaki NaRuto assumptions and generalizations. Therefore Your claims hold no importance or relevance :)
@K B isnt it crazy how most Conversations devolve into hitler propaganda? Only people who have no claims at all usually devolve into comparing hitler to anything to make themselves feel like they are saying anything remotely justified. It‚Äôs called the Godwin‚Äôs law you should look it up
@Y W lol 5.4 million for trumps businesses isn't even an insurance premium. While the bidens are doing personal deals with public resources. But again, you'd rather focus on trump rather than deal with the present corruption. Your partisanship is showing.
@Princess of Keys did you completely miss the Bidens involvement with burisma or receiving kickbacks from the ccp?
@Loren Rich so you'd rather put your head in the sand than recognize the corruption in the Biden regime?
@Vault Dweller Correction; Biden got more than any president. 80  million. And affidavits are NOT evidence. They are statements. Not to mention, some of them have been retracted. They‚Äôve also NOT been swept under the rug, they were brought before 60  courts. So you‚Äôre saying ALL the courts are corrupt? The FBI? The DOJ? The DHS? CISA? The AG? The Republican Govs and AG‚Äôs? All of them corrupt huh? All of them are wrong. But who‚Äôs right..? Your cult leader. Yeah, that‚Äôs MUCH more plausible. You‚Äôre delusional man. And you‚Äôre wrong; this IS about trump and Biden. You all want to overturn the election and place the cult leader back in Office. Just because you can‚Äôt accept that he was beaten. Smh the absurdity of all of your claims is both sad and hilarious.
@V N room for her parents since childhood remind me of The Hunger Games you know that colorful dressed lady on the microphone

@Blax Poitation You‚Äôre gullible dude. He got more votes than ANY president in history - Obama got 69 million....I‚Äôm also mentioned that bc many citizens came forward with signed affidavits. They were all swept under the rug. This is injustice. The way i see it: This is NOT about Trump or Biden. This is about the fact that someone cheated our election and NO ONE cares bc HEY WE WON. Guys....we all lost. If anyone cheats the election - no matter who it is. It needs to be taken seriously.
@DAVID TURCZAK I‚Äôm pretty sure we have jobs. It is proven that Democrats are more educated and are more likely to get a job than a Republican. So if anything, YOU get out of mommy‚Äôs basement and get a job.
@Ginny K She burned the cities of those who hate, those who decide not to have faith in our restoration, she burned them all down.

@Chad Leach , selling out to foreign countries....Trump and russia......or ivanka and china???
@Chad Leach you think Biden is in China's pocket? What about the Trump family's connection to Beijing?? Forbes¬†estimates that at least $5.4 million has flowed into the president‚Äôs business from a lease agreement involving a state-owned bank in Trump Tower. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China signed a lease for space in 2008, years before the president took office, paying about $1.9 million in annual rent. Trump is well-aware of the deal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you the Industrial Bank of China,‚Äù he told three¬†Forbes¬†journalists touring Trump Tower in 2015. ‚ÄúI have the best tenants in the world in this building.‚Äù Trump moved from the skyscraper to the White House in 2017, but he held onto ownership of the retail and office space in the building, through his 100% interest in an entity called Trump Tower Commercial LLC. The¬†New York Times¬†revealed that the U.S. president has a bank account in China. His daughter, Ivanka Trump, received 41 Chinese trademarks from the time she was appointed a White House adviser in March 2017 to April 2019, according to an analysis of documents. The review also showed that the trademarks Ivanka applied for after her father‚Äôs inauguration got approved about 40% faster than those she sought out beforehand. Now, who's the suspicious one?
@Dorset Deb ,what city was burned down???
@IDK anymore America spoke,and it didnt want any more of what trump has to offer.....fascist
@Vault Dweller ü§£
Biden touching girls compilation
@Chad Leach Burisma: The ‚ÄúPOTENTIAL conflict of interest‚Äù is what I read in the Homeland Security doc (investigated under the Trump administration) so if there were a conflict of interest, I‚Äôm sure they would have called it out. CCP: Hunter Biden and his business partners said they had yet to receive a payment from BHR.....if you or anyone you know have evidence please simply produce the proof. Until then, what are we talking about?
@Cocoonen educate yourself! China STILL consider‚Äôs itself Communist though anyone who has been there in recent years (like me in 2018) can see it operates socialist/capitalist https://www.thoughtco.com/communist-countries-overview-1435178. Russia on the other had considers itself a federal republic but still closely operates as a corrupt communist nation (Putin for life?) as he overhauled and abolished the independent states‚Äô federal agreements and clearly cannot be considered a democracy since 2011. So stop assuming YouTube commenters lack education.
Translation: Give me money!
@MoonLightOnWater, neither Russian nor China has never been a communist nation. Russian hasn't even been sosialistic God knows how long, and China... well. It may call itself sosialistic, but can't and (would assume it doesn't even want to) deal with the system, truly. Please, educate yourself.
"... It‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it."? SMH
@J M you do that, commie
@MoonLightOnWater and are you just going to ignore Bidens connections to the ccp and burisma?
@IDK anymore hypocrite. I don‚Äôt think you know what a commie really is. Look in a mirror
It's all about the free government handouts!! Reparations. Even after reparations black people would still complain about what they had nothing to do with 400 years ago.
@Willett Mary DAS RAAAYCISS
@Chad Leach NPC's can't think, they can only repeat scripted lines
@DaViiloW805 shhhh don't talk about that. Besides, that was months ago. It's ancient history in the minds of leftoid NPC's
@DAVID TURCZAK She doesn't have to now, the Democrats will give everyone Basic Income paid for by YOUR TAXES because muh equality
@Dorset Deb let antifa burn your business down or else you're a raciss NATZY
Herpa derp OKAY
@Denise Lmao I love the way you dgaf and keep responding with the same message ü§£ü§£
@IDK anymore cry harder, fascist
@IDK anymore trump likes commies Putin and Kim jung. So trump is the real commie and authoritarian. Putin used trump and America‚Äôs history of racism to try to destroy America‚Äôs own democracy but America‚Äôs Democracy and institutions, good people and self checks are too strong to fail. When you see that than we will forgive you for your sins. Study American history, military history and the Art of War. You will see the big picture of what happened and why was CapitoL Hill attacked.
@Vault Dweller Why is that so hard for you to believe? He got 80 million votes. He beat tRump. Those are the facts. Enjoy the beautiful poem by this lovely, amazingly talented young woman and call it a day.
@Halicarnassus83 im not christian nor religious. Nice try commie
The past doesn't need repairing üòÇ just leave it in the past and move forward ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sounds like race baiting to me

@Dorset Deb anything that the black lives matter people or the anti-fa people did is nothing compared to what those assholes did at the Capitol Nazis are you a Nazi
Wow there was not one thumbs down I guess things are looking up
@Denise You don‚Äôt even realize democracy quietly died just now. If you actually believe Biden got 80 million votes - more than any other president in history. You keep spamming the comment section, love. While we lose our freedoms in our sleep. It‚Äôs all for show now, for people like you üòÄ
@MoonLightOnWater while turing a blind eye to the corrupt Biden administration assisting the ccp in modern day genocide. Glad to see democrats have their priorities lol.
@Aberd you really don't have any attachments to reality left do you?

@Chris Rogers it's a shame that mean racist conspiracy idiots try to take the light of a young person that presented herself incredibly, wrote and spoke such inspirational words. Shame on them.
If we emerge mercy with the might ( Lord Jesus)and the might with the right then love became our legacy !
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs just a pretty sentence. Think about what it excuses. They could change up everything to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù it
I came back to this video to look for that line. It just resonates in me for some reason. Makes me feel hopeful and that I can try harder and always be better. Thank you!
A shame the trolls and qanons have to share their filth with the rest of us. Denise, you‚Äôre a hero!
Like election fraud? You think Biden really got 80 million votes? That breaks the record for all presidents. Also - many many many people came forth with signed affidavits giving their witness statements. All swept under the rug. If anyone no matter who it is, if they steal the election...democracy is already dead we just don‚Äôt feel it yet. Ignorance is bliss my friends
@MoonLightOnWater You mean the 4 year russia impeachment investigation that wasted millions and only resulted in finding out michael flyn lied to the fbi while under no investigation after they threatened his son? Yeah, totally the same lol
@DaViiloW805 don‚Äôt forget the Capitol that fascist desecrated
@Chad Leach or your leader selling out to Russia....don‚Äôt forget both Russia and China are both communist nations that share a very long boarder.
@IDK anymore nope fascist.
@Denise Go Denise!
yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!
So powerful - Akin to the "I have a Dream" speech. I hope that it becomes a speech that kids have to study in school.

@Chad Leach LOL, Try and keep up, the Russia investigation paid for itself with all the money confiscated by the DOJ and FBI, your claims are delusional, flynn was convicted and sentenced and subsequently pardoned by trump, but here's the kicker, get ready, flynn and stone cannot invoke the 5th amendment, that's right, because if they do they go directly to jail and they will soon be joined by trump, when the SDNY gets done with him and the Mannhatten AG it's lights out!!!!! no go cry on your keyboard!!! before mommy calls you up for supper!!!!
Ok, step into the past and rebuild the cities you commies burned down.
Brilliant young woman
This is the line that hit me hardest! Such an amazing poem.

My favorite line!
@Aberd are you talking about how democrats wasted millions of dollars and 4 years because Flynn lies to the fbi while under no investigation? All while the Biden administration has clear ties to not just the ccp but Ukraine as well? This is why I'm worried, your so partisan you don't care about truth anymore.
@Chad Leach Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying beautiful, powerful poetry over here. üòåüíï

@Jeffrey Walker the cult will never understand
Where do you get such notions? Your own self-repeated narrow narrative.
‚ÄúThe Hill We Climb‚Äù -Amanda Gorman Wednesday, January 20, 2021 When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We‚Äôve braved the belly of the beast, we‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace and the norms and notions of what just is, isn‚Äôt always justice. And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it, somehow we do it, somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one. And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect, we are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. So we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: that even as we grieved, we grew, even as we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired, we tried, that we‚Äôll forever be tied together victorious, not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one should make them afraid. If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time, then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade, but in in all of the bridges we‚Äôve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it. We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. That would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy, and this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can periodically be delayed, but it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us, this is the era of just redemption we feared in its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves, so while once we asked how can we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us. We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be, a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free, we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, our blunders become their burden. But one thing is certain: if we merge mercy with might and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left, with every breath from my bronze, pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one, we will rise from the golden hills of the West, we will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution, we will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked South, we will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful, when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid, the new dawn blooms as we free it, for there is always light if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it.

‚Äã@Andrey Pena Jimenez Red herringed and Ad hominemed me b/c you couldn't dispute something that's I said to be true. Politics are the death of art if you ever bothered to learn more about the subject. She knows who's paying her and who she's catering to with this political stunt
@Shadowiff you‚Äôre so bitter that she‚Äôs more bright and elegant than you will ever be. Expand the light and love with yourself
Bam! Ouch! How about Native Americans? Read. Again. The ancestors of living Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. A vast variety of peoples, societies and cultures subsequently developed.
And still nobody on the planet is more racist than an American black. Cool that she can write poems though
I wanna throw a book at her awesome young lady just awesome
Gonna have a speech now by a black, Hispanic,. homosexual, transsexual, bisexual, Muslim, illegal migrant and combination thereof.

Jealousy was lucifer's sin, stop it. As if you could have written such a poem and read it

Chillsssss
Starting to feel like black people in America are put on a pedestal while us other minorities are left in their shadow Like we don‚Äôt work hard too Like people like us that aren‚Äôt white faced struggles Like we didn‚Äôt face discrimination at some point in our lives
That's right, "descended from slaves". I knew that was coming at some point. Much of this was lifted from speeches of Barak and Michelle.
@Josephine Bournes Of course the haters have to descend. Trump supporters see only race. They don‚Äôt have the ability to look any further. I am also amazed at how may people thought this was a speech and didn‚Äôt know she was the Poet Laureate.
Triggered much?
Dang not only is she an incredible speaker she‚Äôs so fashionable that headband is so cute
Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Brought me to tears. Maybe there is some hope for our country (and it's reputation) if this any indicator of things to come and choosing "the best people". Intelligent, inspiring, poised, and absolutely gorgeous!
Wow
It is now all in gods hands. Let live and let god
Bla bla bla
How old do you have to be in order to be President. I vote for Amanda. Through our youth we have hope. Amazing!
‚ÄúBrave enough to be it!‚Äù üíô
She gets a 100! Even her outfit was perfect! Her words and look are a beacon of sunshine!
Full transcript: When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade We've braved the belly of the beast We've learned that quiet isn't always peace And the norms and notions of what just is Isn‚Äôt always just-ice And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it Somehow we do it Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn‚Äôt broken but simply unfinished We the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one And yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn‚Äôt mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect We are striving to forge a union with purpose To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another We seek harm to none and harmony for all Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew That even as we hurt, we hoped That even as we tired, we tried That we‚Äôll forever be tied together, victorious Not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again sow division Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree And no one shall make them afraid If we‚Äôre to live up to our own time Then victory won‚Äôt lie in the blade But in all the bridges we‚Äôve made That is the promise to glade The hill we climb If only we dare It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it‚Äôs the past we step into and how we repair it We‚Äôve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy And this effort very nearly succeeded But while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated In this truth in this faith we trust For while we have our eyes on the future history has its eyes on us This is the era of just redemption We feared at its inception We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter To offer hope and laughter to ourselves So while we once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was but move to what shall be A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation Our blunders become their burdens But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children‚Äôs birthright So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we‚Äôre brave enough to see it If only we‚Äôre brave enough to be it
Omg you are my new favorite person üíú
@K B honey what? Do you understand Trump is a white supremacist? He himself is no different from Hitler... but you do you I suppose...
Awwww this is so beautiful. So much glaze and beauty in it. Her poise is out of this world.
Your going to have to find light, yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!
@Alex , I am just stating a fact.
@Lisa bbb the disrespect and ignorance...
Thank You ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thank you
She was so boring. Zzzzzz
Thank you so much

There is always light if we are brave enough to see it...if we are brave enough to be it.
This. Just...this.
I couldn't wait to see Ga Ga's National Anthem, I came away Loving this little Angel!
Amazing
Vapid, trite, myopic, and boring.
she got me
this was extremely cringe.
a waste of a poem
Beautiful! I hope Biden continues in Obama's legacy of giving the arts a platform in the white house. The last 4 years have been devoid of art.
Where is the frist man lol üòÇ
Incredibly talented and beautiful girl ... Bravo!
Wow. So humbling. A Courageous pure light. üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ yesssssssss‚òÆüíû

Trump would have you believe this young women should not have a voice let alone a vote. I‚Äôm not even an American, but I‚Äôm so proud of this inspirational women, and so glad trump and his endless BS had finally come to an end.
Great, there you have your first female presidentüò±üëç
OMG. I'm printing this for my wall. "Lift our gaze to not what is between us but to what stands before us"... "harm to none, harmony to all"... "Victory lies not in the blade but in the bridge"... "Merge mercy with might"... OMG
@Baby Teano Me too.
@Vickie Shoemaker ikr, at first I thought she's a teenager.
This was amazing! A fantastic speech to start the new Presidential administration
I will leave the world to this young lady, Ms. Gorman.

WE ARE BRAVE ENOUTH TO SEE AND WE ARE BRAVE ENOUTH TO BE IT!! ~ SHE STOOD AS A BRIGHT LIGHT FOR ALL OF US TO SEE!! WHAT A HOPE AND MOVING TOWARDS VICTORY POETIC POEM!!!
Nahhh peak of american poetry was Eliot and Bukowski. Nothing more can be said about America until we start colonizing Mars
Two of the worst most overrated poets ever.
This was beautiful. Thank you Amanda.
Sorry to be that guy but history tells us democracy always fails. U can change the players in this game but still the same rules and goals. I pray for all the lives lost üôè love you all Great poem btw well delivered üëç
Wow. My politics are probably very different from hers, but even I can acknowledge this is one hell of a speech. She's channeling Dr. King perfectly.
Amazing ‚ù§
Her grace is awe inspiring!
Incredible, such wisdom from such a young person. I was in tears.

Amazing. She embodies the beauty of America
Who cares
@Jimmy Wilson Ah yes, the side more capable of violence is the right side. You guys totally don‚Äôt sound like fascists or anything
A couple hundred million people.
Add this to the education curriculum, youth should study this wonderful poem for generations to come.
Wowww!!!! üíñ‚ù§Ô∏è Speechless!! üëç
this is probably what trump supporters afraid of: black girl speaking with intelligence and elegance beyond their comprehension, "what does she mean? I don't get it, omg, how can she be smarter than me, so scary, give me back the 3rd grade talking guy that I could understand."
These people know they didn't win
@Debby Utz so?
@Z Davis A rigged election IS A LIE UPON US ALL. ANY BIDEN SUPPORTER KNOWS THIS..HE LOST BADLY ü§£üëøüëøü§¢
Exactly lol! Trump supporters just can‚Äôt let it go
This is honestly one of the best speeches I have ever heard.
supernova
@Master Joe Ker seeing all the hate directed toward this young woman made me think Americans are not so good. My Chinese friends made similar attacks on the young Hong Kong protesters and I thought them unfair, and that much more work needs to be done in China to accept new ideas. But here you guys are being equally narrow-minded. What a waste of your freedoms
You‚Äôve never heard a great speech then. This little girl is acting like she saved the world. She hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything. She hasn‚Äôt helped anyone. She doesn‚Äôt know anything.
Wow. Did you hear this for the first time and only this? This crap was worse than watching an old lady in a bukkakke video
It sounds like it was "written" by Amazon Alexa, a slam prose-poem cobbled together from Instagram inspirational quotes and a hodgepodge of mediocre college valedictorian speeches.
@Ranger DYH Amazon More like prose but tomato tamato
It‚Äôs a poem
Certainly from her heart ...... :) Zoe , Canadian
I really love the ‚Äúquiet doesn‚Äôt always mean peace‚Äù like yassss preach destroy these demagogues
@dreams Pointing the finger, part of the problem. When Biden calls for unity, it is this type of behavior that he is referring too.
@dreams she said one of.
Amen to that.
top notch
I wouldn't say the best but it's a great speech/poem especially at such a dire time. Trump supporters don't even know how to hate on this they're just saying a bunch of nothing in the comments.
Biggest hoax on the American people that ever happened SHAME ON YOU SHAME ON YOU FRAUDS
@Jeffrey Walker what do you know about it- ü§£
The hoax here is people like you saying that there is a hoax, based solely on the fraud claims of a President who told 22,000 lies in his presidency, who has never known the truth, whose claims were repudiated by his own attorney general and homeland security chief, whose court cases claiming fraud were defeated 64 times, who is facing his second impeachment trial along with civil and state trials in many districts. A man who can barely read.
@Z Davis just ignore the cult. They are going to need a year or two to get back in reality.
@Z Davis I'm not crying ITS THE TRUTH YOU ARE A FRAUD IN THE MATRIX
Keep crying about it
Victorious!!! Yes!!! Let's go!!!
Poise, precision, passion, power and heart. Unbelievable and humbling.
"This is the president WE have selected FOR you. You will abandon all protest and acknowledge his power. Your voices will be silenced" - The Swamp

You go girl üôÇüôÇ
Lovely and inspiring. Hope rekindled.

True beauty in her soul!!!!! So moving and so needed. Beautiful beautiful words and message
Kamala Harrisüëé
One of the most extraordinarily beautiful poems ive heard. üî•üíØüí´üíñ Wow
Inspiring young lady. But above all, make The United States of American a Wonderful place again by: "Promise Yourself To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet. To make all your friends feel that there is something in them. To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true. To think only the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own. To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile. To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others. To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble. To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world, not in loud words but great deeds. To live in faith that the whole world is on your side so long as you are true to the best that is in you." ~Chistain D-Larson~
Amen! So inspired
Fake fraudulent illegitimate President.
@Jeffrey Walker Wow, that sounds like the typical liberal Democrat. Ya'll are hypocrites.
@Dr. Fu Manchu No, you are doing that, flying in the face of all evidence, perpetuating disinformation, fed by distorted networks, and responsible for inciting reprehensible attacks on the Capitol January 6. Most of your heroes are facing the music soon enough.
You just keep telling yourself that @Jeffrey Walker .
Oh well, im glad he's a illegitimate president then
The fraud here is you claiming that there is a fraud, perpetuated by a fraudulent former President, and fraud claims proffered in 65 court cases all defeated except one where Pennsylvania shortened its 9 day limit on mail-in votes to 6 days. NOT one case of proof of fraud. And all recounts upheld.
The next Next of this generation. Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes would be proud of her.
Her body language adds a tremendous amount of feeling to her words. Her eyes, her facial expressions - and of course her hands. This is a very special woman.
@Lucia Lazarte did you really say actor? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§°
@Salty Gorilla So?
@Rohmash you're so right... There's nothing fake about that talent. This is one elite talented actress and race charlatan!üíØüíØüíØ‚úäüòÇ
@Mark Mandel lmaooo she certainly is good at what she does. Look how professionally you pulled the race card as if she trained you herself. Damn she goood my ninja!
@King Ghidorah no bone to pick. Y‚Äôall just like her cause she be BLACK!!!
@King Ghidorah he didnt lose. Dead voters voted for dead Joe. My man Trump WILL BE BACK IN 24!!!!! Mmmmaaaagggggaaaa fool!
@Steel pulse she ‚Äúhealed‚Äùthe nation???ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
@Latisha ü§£ü§£ü§£ok
@Abby C. if thats the case then have your 9yr old write a poem to help heal the nation then post it on YouTube so we can all see if it's so easy to do.
What‚Äôs so special? My 9 year old could have ‚Äúrecited‚Äù the same. ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
100 percent
@Lucia Lazarte you are so pathetic SHE WROTE THE POEM HERSELF!!! she been doing poetry for quite awhile before this.
@Rohmash well said
Couldn't agree more üëè
@Bailey Ballin Every response you write comes in the form of a three paragraph essay just stfu already Karen üôÑ
@Lucia Lazarte I'm pretty sure she wrote it.. herself. Are you good?
Idk but it just looked like she paid attention in her class on "101 - How to present something". Sometimes a bit over the top, like she is presenting something for elementary school kids.
@Reaver Red Ok, buddy...I can hardly tell what your point is because your punctuation is so god-awful. I'm assuming that you're trying to say that even if she's intelligent, it's not enough? Enough for what exactly? I was simply replying to someone that she is clearly intelligent and that she did write the poem. That simple. I'm not asking you to praise or worship her, I was just making a point. And although simply being a graduate from any old college doesn't necessarily prove intelligence, graduating from the top college in the country certainly does.
She works for the Deep State
Too Bad Its All BULL
@Lucia Lazarte are you serious right now?
@HoorayTV21 it‚Äôs called sour grapes. What is your problem!
I love that left eye that closed at times - like a new thought was forming in her mind, as she delivered her beautiful message. Her physicality was almost as powerful as he words. Such grace.
@HoorayTV21 Sure, bud. It's definitely acting. Very good insight üòå... Wouldn't expect anything more from a person who can't even use the right "it's" in a sentenceüòÇ....
its........its called acting.
I believe they're called actors.There isn't really anything special about them apart from their ability to lie convicingly.
@Lucia Lazarte Funny how you automatically assume she didn't write it. I know we're all tired of politicians with phony speeches and teleprompters, but this young woman is truly talented and intelligent. She wrote this herself. Don't believe me? Look for yourself : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Gorman And she's a Harvard Graduate, so she's obviously pretty damn smartüòÇ.
@Mark Mandel biden is White.
@Mark Mandel true. All that person wants is to be a ReTrumplican making America .. Grate .. again. Amanda made the world Soar with her resounding delivery
Be graceful in your praise even if monetary instead of the way you are. You don‚Äôt leave a good legacy for your .. life here on earth
She had on MAYA ANGELO 'S FAVORITE COLOR YELLOW  OPRAH BROUGHT THE RING.
Special.. indeed üòÇ
@Lucia Lazarte If you assume everypne demonstrating talent is faking, where do you think the real talented people are? Just because you can't write an inspiring speech doesn't mean she can't.
@Lucia Lazarte she is a Harvard graduate.
@Lucia Lazarte She is a poet and author...
@Lucia Lazarte You really think so? You think she can't write for herself, that she's reciting somebody else's words. Then WHY so? Because she's young, female, and Black? If that's what you think, I pity you.
About as *special* as Greta Thunberg.
She is a good actor and has excellent instructors who are paid to write for her, money can buy everything, at least for short time.
Very!!
who else is watching for a second time? WOW!!!
@MariNa 21 https://youtu.be/tgpXjJ7pSkQ

I think it's my tenth watch today! ‚ô°

Just wow! She's going to go places for sure. Brilliant
I swear us americans are swayed too easily by good words  social grandstanding.nothings changed ,...we the people are still on the outside in this pandemic without gov help,aid or relief.we must hold them accountable to the lies they feed us daily ,in time well see.
Nobody gives a crap
Incredible üëèüëèüëè

Thank you üá∫üá∏üíìüáßüáº
Powerful!!!
Amazing...Well Written  Well Delivered! Standing Ovation Young Lady!!!!
Had to watch here because people were talking over her on peacock airing.
@Savvy9 I watched the live MSNBC coverage. I'm sorry for your experience but at least you can rewatch clips on YouTube.
@Josephine Bournes literally everyone couldn't couldn't shut up. In fairness they were talking all through Garth's singing too.
Let me guess, Joe Scarborough couldn't keep his mouth shut ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Amazing.
It's the child that biden was talking about that likes to rub his leg hairs... All grown up now
I got tears listening to her. She is a beautiful young lady. So much respect for what she said. I pray that our country can unite and just get along. I have so many friends of color and race but that's just it, we're Friends and we get along and don't judge. God bless everyone !!!
Just wow ‚ù§Ô∏è
Graceful and Beautifully said Ma‚Äôam
This is the poetic vaccination our country needed. Let these words course through all of us and fend off the bitter political division that has been disseminated throughout our country.
@Hello Mark how are you doing?
In other words up yours trump
The left: America is inherently evil and rooted in systemic racism that has no redeeming value The left the minute Biden is sworn in: America is like sunshine and rainbows dancing across the land with love and hugs for everyone
The Right is what roots it in systemic racism. Good lord, it‚Äôs a new administration‚Äôs inauguration. Should our nation not speak of hope on this day?
Straight communist brainwashed girl ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sad that when she sees a white person she gets scared because blacks told her that.
U just scared to fight thumbs down
Beautiful poem.
Wake up !!!
She absolutely knocked my sox off!! Brilliantly beautiful!!
She made me think I'm biracial üòçüëçüèª
Gives me chills!!!!
Talk to em !!!
One of the best things about today is, we don't have to be forced to listen to lies by a loser on Twitter.
Congrats to all of you who voted for Biden. With a Democrat President, Senate and House and no one to stand in the way of the progressive agenda, you will soon get everything you voted for. When your taxes go up. Remember you asked for it. When your Social Security and Medicare benefits are cut so non-citizens can get benefits they never paid for. Remember you asked for it. When you lose your health care because of Medicare for all, including anyone who crosses the border. Remember you asked for it. When the border is left open to anyone looking to freeload off the American taxpayers. Remember you asked for it. When your daughters cannot compete in school sports or use a public restroom because little Johnny thinks he a girl. Remember you asked for it. When you lose your 2nd amendment Rights, Remember you asked for it. When you are forced to pay for College for all, even if you or your children never went to college, remember you asked for it. When cities across America turn into Chicago, Baltimore, Portland and San Francisco while rioters are screaming ‚ÄúDefund the police" remember you asked for it. When the federal government takes on trillions in debt to bailout Democrat states and cities suffering from decades of mismanagement and corruption, it will be call pandemic relief or something disguised as a covid bill, just remember you asked for it. When they expand the size of the Supreme Court and fill those seats with young progressive judges so their actions will forever be declared legal. Remember you asked for it. When our military is defunded and countries like Iran, North Korea, Russia and China are less afraid to challenge us. Remember you asked for it. You have blamed everything that has happened in the last 4 years on President Trump. Who will have you to blame at the end of the next 4?
Absolutely unbelievable, inspiring, eloquent, mighty, gracious. All at the same time. No trembling once in such a historical moment, despite being so young. So Impressive
Pc culture in to face üñï
I hope one day a skinny black girl descended from slaves can not just see a black woman recite for a president, but see a president who is a black girl like her
She's trying way too hard. Too dramatic for a speech
A poem is not a speech, it is an artistic expression.
Ahh just so proud of this young lady üëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüôèüèø
incredible. Truth and hope.
What a farce! This is a General, he knows what he is talking about! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbCJ7NHSeC4
I'm bawling with relief and gratitude üôèüèΩ
Lame.
And she is only 23....Good job!!
Amen! Beautiful powerful elegant assertive empowering soul stirring. Ms. Amanda Gorman
It made me cry as well as hope. Well done.
I got chills.
Magnificent`~ very moving
Wow! Impressive. "Never again sow division."
And you think that's going to happen because of her speech??? Ok....
Thanks Mr President who locked up the most black people in recent American history via the 1994 Crime Bill. Thank you Mr President who was opposed to desegregation in the 70s.
The Nation is broken and the Democrats with the help of the Media broke it.
I agree she was great the words and the way she let everything flow threw so clean and gentle yet powerful it was inspiring
Words of wisdom from someone so young - from me in the UK
The scintillating slipper consistently serve because brand comprehensively pack forenenst a shaggy mice. amazing, noisy softdrink
Great poem, really impressed by this young lady
I cried ü•∫
What a talented young poet. All races have talented person's, this one shines.! (aside from the good  or bad in each race  creeds.) Many thanks to all Trump's militia supporters  what he $stood for, today marks a remembrance day to you all, in your change to peace etc  making inaugurations day a better way forward for ALL. Trump must have had brain surgery? his recent speech's have a mild tone, but per-his-usual, proud boys etc never heard of them, he's had nothing to do with your goings on etc.
I'm down to make love our legacy
I suddenly remembered a part in Obama's inauguration, when one of the guests was bringing her kid along, the news man announced him as "Governor of Kindergarten"
Disgusting pandering to black people. Typical Democrat nonsense
This is one of the most beautiful, eloquent and amazing speech I have seen.
Why is literally everything about race for democrats?
She spoke beautifully, but we must listen with our hearts and not just our ears, because when we turn a deaf ear to the truth, we can never prevail. Our one nation under God will remain stagnant as before, but I pray God will grant healing, peace, and love to this country. Because all men are created equal. And there's one race, the human race. God bless America.
Well said. Thank you.
Wish I had print of this..Will go down in history..Well Done, young lady ,Well Done indeed
Look truough the comment, someone put it down inhere.. üòÄ üëç üé∂
Wow this young woman is going places. May God bless her and her beautiful gift!
@K B maybe you and donny bonespurs can have a big butthurt party.....stop the hate
Im sure yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!
Gotta have that racial shyt thrown in or its just not a democratic function.
You lost bro and will never win again the time for this who support racism and those who pretend it doesn't exist is over.
She literally said ‚Äúwe lay down our arms‚Äù at Biden‚Äôs swearing in. Y‚Äôall cool with this? There goes your right to bear arms.
@It is Well Canada? üá®üá¶
The right has been talking about the left taking their guns for decades and it hasn‚Äôt happened. Faux outrage
@Zachariah most Americans, especially the cult supporters shouldn't have guns
@cj3madrid even if they did a small false flag psyop wouldn‚Äôt give them the right to strip us of our rights. Enjoy your multicultural word salad and keep scrolling.
@Zachariah, oh, BROTHER! If we were going to take your guns away we would have done it on January 7, 2021.
@Doris Green there‚Äôs a reason she‚Äôs using a phrase about laying down guns and it‚Äôs not because she‚Äôs a wordsmith she was chosen. She is brilliant and positively a genius with words and rhetoric sure but that‚Äôs irrelevant.
@It is Well I‚Äôm for Americans right to bear arms. You can‚Äôt be for Americans if you‚Äôre not for their right to bear arms. Because she‚Äôs good with words, you think everything bening. Okay then. Enjoy that false innocence.
Laying down your arms does not take away your right to bear arms. Let that sink in for a moment.
We lay down our arms against each other. Americans should always be for Americans
she was phenomenal
What a wonderful speech! Uplifting and full of promise!
Eloquence at its finest. The clarity is just beyond perfection. Hmmmmmm
The Biden / Harris presidency beginning with a BANG ! She is the BEST OF the inauguration! I want her the example for my daughters...

@The Brotha Ohh that's what you mean, I thought it was said in a rude way towards her. Yes it's good that she is spreading the word and prophecy
@chars. because the true Jews were forced to forget there heritage as it was prophesied and in the end days after their suffering another event will change the world and her and her people now stepping up is unveiling the prophecy itself
@Lisa bbb Just because you didn‚Äôt understand what she was saying doesn‚Äôt mean others don‚Äôt
@The Brotha is that supposed to be of importance here, an insult?
@Lisa bbb shut up

I now have hope in this Country. RIGHT ON POINT
The background check the nazis performed was on people with Jewish ancestors i.e. racist screening not the screening for racists, which the inaugeration security conducted.
yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!
Beautiful !!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
Biden is a Fraud
Good for him
A young Maya Angelou, this young lady has quite a future before her.
peakae44 I thought her dad was Jamaican? don't know much bout politics or what not so i apologize in advance if i'm wrong
@Secret Oktober78 Harris's father was from Haiti and mother from South India. Where does the plantation ancestry come in?
@aissatou sunjata What are the chances that some of the slave labor to build DC came from Harris‚Äô great great grand pappy plantation? Asking for a friend
I know the compliment you pay her. Yet, she is not a young Maya Angelou. Dr. Angelou was secondary to her poetry contributions to creativity, her autobiography contributions. This young lady is representing the birth of someone new to the words of a legacy of wordsmiths. She can certainly be considered one who represents the future, but she is her own and not a young Maya Angelou. No disrespect intended and of course, you are due your own point of reference of course. I guess poets are always compared or identified by someone before. I look at her and see the first black female and Asian Vice President, the exact same view Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stood during his speech and the hands of those slaves who built that white house. I hear them all standing proud.
Such fierce delivery; so accomplished and so young. An inspiration
Oh my dear God. I was moved to tears! What a brilliant light she is!!!
truly beautiful Amanda , I hope  pray that Biden et al live up to your vision for the future
Edward Snowden quote: These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying. social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power. Now Covid19 it's not about a virus it's to destroy privacy, internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world...It's about power and control.
Joe wears DEPENDS...Whilst he Offends...The Free Will of"We the People"..
Do you have a point?
Fantastic poem! A definite highlight of the inauguration. Welcome back America - with this poem and your new president I hope you gain courage and strength you need to recover from your 4 year nightmare.
I‚Äôm speechless üò∂ she was extremely awesome nothing but the best
Beautiful!
i was watching this during class and these kids were shaking there heads no as if they could not believe what was going on there isent really anything i just wanted to share what i went threw today
For all the people who attempted the coup on the 6th of January, the words and deep meaning of the poem will hunt them for the rest of their lives if only they have conscience.
@Keith Bardes Any coup must be planned .
@Keith Bardes Of course they were armed, you idiot. Now they‚Äôre sitting in jail.
Keep drinking the kool aid...That was a real serious attempted "coup". They let everyone know that the plan was to go from the White House to the capitol building over a week before the event. The only shot fired was from the capitol police because the protesters were unarmed. Yep seems like a planned "coup" to me.

These 333 people who dislike this video,do they really understand what she is saying?
They are trump supporters, what do you expect from them?

Powerful and beautiful!
I am completely blown away by Ms Gorman. She was previously unknown to me, but I will never forget the poem she delivered today. Truly beautiful words. "We've learned that quiet isn't always peace and the norms and notions of what just is, isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is hours before we knew it, somehow we do it, somehow we‚Äôve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished." Damn.
Just like Biden supporters
Well said! You‚Äôre amazing.
Wow √≥ wow if that doesn't give u chills well ur not human, she's amazing the new wordsmith üíØüáÆüá™üíôüá∫üá∏BLM

Posüí©traitor . Illegitimate election
I'm so happy it was a illegitimate election
Bravo Amanda ... bravo ... extraordinary ... I have renewed hope for the country.
Very Skilled Speaker
OMG! This young black woman gave me chills! I love the gifts Oprah gave her as well. When I read about that I shed a tear of joy...for this young lady is blessed in so many ways. I will be following her from now on.
Amen üôèüèΩ
It's a unique style, but like a rapper poet. The stops, the punctuation.
Beautiful spoken word
Could you please write down the full poem? Tks for sharing.
"I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."---10% Joe, 2019
Eloquent, classy, beautiful, intelligent young lady
Fake cheating Dems, It's sickening, fake propaganda. Hairy legs, remember?
I'm glad the dems cheated

If president Trump had such a large military force and build a wall around city hall the media would have called him a FACIST and Natzis, so it looks like biden and harris Are the true FACIST and Natzis!!!!
Absolutely fantastic. I can see her running for a higher office.
Pretty average
KlLL ALL DEMOCRATS

I don't want my kids growing up in a racial jungle :Jim Crow Joe Biden
When they first said "Poet Laureate" I thought, ehhh not my thing. Turns out it's my thing, Wow just amazing.
Thank people like Lin-Manuel Miranda who influenced her. (She tweeted him to see if he heard the 2 Hamilton references she made). We need to keep arts in schools for this very reason!
Now it's my thing too!
@AnnaBell033 fantastic comment.
Lol. Right ü§£‚ù§
Wow: Wise beyond her years. That young lady has a power of words. Watch that space.
@AnnaBell033 yes.üëç
Poetry is probably telling more truth than the news right now...it is an amazing medium to showcase how current events (personal and communal) impact lives. She was amazing.
I can lie. I'm not into poetry much either but she's so beautiful i started to watch. I'm glad I did, what a powerful appeal and words combined.
üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
I felt the same way but boy howdy, am I glad I listened! She's brilliant!
Thank you for articulating this moment in America, and renewing our faith in a nation united, not divided!
Who are you kidding we are a nation divided a little poem is not going to save the nation or is Biden go talk to black lives matter and all the businesses they burned in Portland
The media sucks sometimes but it definitely doesn't divide us like the republicans say the only thing dividing us is the hate of republicans. Mental health is a factor as well but thats another dicussion.
Message to the younger people; you think things are bad for you now? Just wait another 5-10 years.
Amanda Gorman! God bless YOU! You are stunning and a very powerful young lady! As a grandmother of three little beautiful granddaughters...your speech has lifted my heart in this dark times and gives me HOPE for their future! Waoooo.....Powerful and Charismatically Speech!
Priceless Stated God Bless The United State Of American...
Translation: I'm on this podium coz Biden pretends he is a ID box ticker, which was just to get the votes of the 'usefull fools' BLM and Antifa on board, as Joseph Biden, sorry Joseph Stalin would say.
Translation: I'm an angry white supremacist who can't deal with the fact that the country and planet don't agree with my backwards hateful ideology so I'm going to cry and make thinly veiled racist comments online üò¢
Beautiful.
The spirit of Martin Luther King and all those who fought for justice  humanity speaks through this wonderful young woman...i feel inspired  humbled in equal measure...thank you !!
A disgrace to our country
@Ghostface 7 thank you. That is exactly what is happening now.
white supremacist cult members who want to destroy democracy and install their con-man cult leader as king? I agree, disgraceful
Perfection expressed; Hope, emboldened!
A true heir to Martin Luther King Jr. Inspiring, complex, lyrical, evocative. I listened to the whole ceremony. This is what I will come back to hear again.
I said to myself. I want to see that performance again. She was wonderful
This brought me to tears !!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
Amazing üëè
This was phenomenal.. only a salty white supremacist could be mad at this
Solid bait.
omg im about` to cry !
Black people are America's mascots. Remember Maya Angelou speaking at Bill Clinton's inauguration? ...then they passed the '94 crime bill. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Beautiful
Brought tears to my eye's. I hope we can turn our country into her vision.
Impressive !!! She's also adorable, I can say that because I'm really old.
I could think of 1000 words to describe her. Adorable, beautiful, awesome, articulate, gorgeous and elegant. üëç
A child shall lead us!!
Awesome poem remember it when gas is eight dollars excuse me yen a gallon and we are being invaded by third world illegals.
@Ghostface 7 They won't take them they will send someone else to try. They are cowards. They are not scary non white people they are like locus. If they had a back bone they would fight for their own country and yes I did my time in the military.
@Steven H B-B-BUT DA RADICAL LEFT SOCIALISTS ARE GOING TO TAKE R GUNZ!!!! HOW WILL WE STOP DA INVASION OF SCARY NON-WHITE PEOPLE DEWD!? üò±
@Ghostface 7 They better be wearing a bullet proof vest that goes for anyone that might want to try.
OMG DA BROWN PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR YOU BRO!!!
Well spoken!
Remarkable,my first ray of hope in all this darkness.
I feel sorry for anyone who came before or after her. Apparently that's everyone haha.
@Lisa bbb why would you be watching something you don't like?that doesn't make any sense,
@Alberta Rivers I agree we need unity, but it was never the founding fathers intention for the USA to be under a god. The whole point is for it to be under no god or many gods. God has nothing to do with it.
Yeah, imagine having to give a speech after this haha.
@Colley Hillary , she over did it. It looks ridiculous n cartoonist.
@Lisa bbb Poetry just like music performance is personal...you wanted a lifeless statue?...lady statue of liberty is over there!
I didn't care for it either, just can't stand that Allen Ginsberg beat poet cadence and inflection which after 50 years now just sounds like a parody of itself. I'm more of a Maya Angelou girl. I appreciate the message though.
@Kelly Patrick , it looks like she is doing ballerina on a speech stage. Lol. So awful
üòÇ ...yet the standards can rise, we must not stand in the way or let mediocrity reign.
@Lisa bbb Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
@Lisa bbb I wonder what could be so unbearable about flowers, life, or movement..
@Blackberry4life , too flowery. Please get off stage.
@Lisa bbb You're ignorant and can't appreciate art! Free your mind sweetheart, and the rest will follow.
She is to flowery. All the silly hand movement. I was glad she was finish.
Side note this was meant to mean how amazing she is. That was on the same level as Martin Luther King Jr. Words can't express how amazing she is.
@Alberta Rivers so true
@Alberta Rivers I'm actually Canadian and I agree. It felt refreshing to see something positive instead of the constant negative.
America needs healing. and love not hate. Look into your heart for peace and love. We all live in America together. One nation under God.
Brought tears to my eyes and made my heart swell.
Me too!
Simply Beautiful....
such a voice.
Wow what a talent! I thought I was only going to stay for a minute, stayed for the whole thing.
All fake
Injustice happens every day in other parts of the world. But it is not far away - it happened in the US Justice System and Congress
Maya Angelou smiles satisfyingly......perfect!!.
Maya Angelou is smiling and laughing her incredible laugh from the great beyond.You and we have done her proud. Your grace and wisdom, young woman, are beautiful to behold. Let's love one another.

I got chills wow
Sorry, but I found this rambling free verse severely inadequate (justice/just is? Seriously?), her diction and phrasing unnecessarily syncopated, and the message trite and unmemorable. A wasted opportunity for poetry, which has so little exposure of this magnitude.
Why was that bs neccessary??
Just wow. I'm speachless
I was mesmerized by her words, her delivery.

@Christina Vaccaro who cares what you think. Drama queen. Come on now. Why would you even say transgender anyway???. 95 % of people loved her speech. Negativity will rot your mind
@Christina Vaccaro well first of all i don't care what race she is. I'm an old white guy that found her absolutely drop dead gorgeous. And as far as just someone down the street , she's won national awards and i believe she a Harvard graduate. Cant you just give a young person some support for their accomplishments.
@dreams how could someone not have enjoyed such a beautiful young lady. I think she's a Harvard graduate also. Sadly i guess some people just can't just give a compliment or shut up
@Christina Vaccaro well someone's having a pissy ass attitude about cheering on our youth. Sad
@Christina Vaccaro I bet you weigh 400 pounds
I agree totally but she's so pretty i had a hard time listening to her. üòâü§ó

All for what? Same BS!
Beautifully written and spoken! Amanda Gorman is amazing.
Seeing sheps face after all that was jarring
So strong so beautiful so pure and those words so powerful.Thank you.
Damn. Electric. Magnificent. "how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?" It felt like catastrophe had been prevailing, but it did not. Moving forward from these last hellish years, let this poem be our creed. "We will rise. We will recover." Thank you, Ms. Gorman.
Joe Biden's audience for his inauguration is the military. If they allowed real Americans to attend in person they would be shouting *Fake President Fake President* And so Americans were not allowed in the area. We are not with this fake President that got in with corrupt voting.
Lol moronic cultist, give it a rest
Boycott Communist media
Wow!ü§óü§©
Triumphant.
Beautiful young woman and poem. I got stuck on one part of her poem but for the most part- well done!!!
What a beautiful inspiring young woman! The future is bright!!
Brilliant! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Power and beauty. An honor to receive your poem.
incredible
Not to be mean, but this is when I was looking at my watch...
the voice of the future, a privilege to hear Amanda's words
Before reacting to John's comment please check if you understand it correctly. English can be sometimes tricky that way. And please dont get into the band wagon just becos one person reacted negatively that too without really understanding of what what he is saying here. I am pretty sure John is saying that 'She is a voice of our future, our hope' and it is our privilege that we are here to hear Amanda's words! John, I completely agree with you. It is a privilege for us to hear her voice.
@Abu Lahab bro why are you out here shilling for white supremacists? I‚Äôm white and I know that decent white people aren‚Äôt a problem. NeoNazis are
The voice of an activist that insists people LIKE YOU are the cause of everything wrong. Oh, you‚Äôll GET your future, alright.
@Random Person Which country are you from?
@Random Person is that a threat?
@Random Person Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòå
You will not be alive to hear her again.
What a brilliant young woman. She is truly a shining example of the promise of America's youth.
love her 3
you have made us so proud Amanda ‚ù§
Yaaaassss chocolate Princess!!! A diamond.
üí•Boom......mic drop!
Wow! just wow... so great to hear after the ramblings of the tangerine menace for the past ...84 years was it?
"There is always light if only we are brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to *be* it." Absolutely beautiful... chills all over.
White House" Circus " and the clowns running the show for the fools believe on their lies and deceptive manipulation.
Nice try but the Republic is now dead.
Gag.
Amen ! Amen ! Amanda very beautify The future is yours to dream and conquer.
Great Poem.
She will be in the history books, that poem is going to be a permanent part of American history 3
Naw, it probably won‚Äôt, we live in a fast food, what have you done for me lately, what‚Äôs trending next generation. This will probably be forgotten in 6 months. I‚Äôm not criticizing but that‚Äôs just the nature of things now a days.
Haha
Lets build a statue of her that will be torn down by communists in true American fashion.
Hey can you post the last text on the subject of history longer than 1000 words you've read in the previous decade? Thanks. Because as somebody who actually does read history books, no, she will not be featured. Maybe a footnote on works centered on Biden specifically, definitely not in any general history textbook read in mandatory schooling. The speech is pathetic compared to the great orators of history
And Jamaican history üáØüá≤ she represents VP other half/roots. Jamerican... when you are half and half
Yup. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beautiful speech ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
It was a very passionate speech!
Ho pensato anch'io la stessa cosa. E credo che non rimarr√† permanentemente solo alla storia Americana
And a permanent promise for American posterity. [keeping in style...]
Yes, I just pre-ordered her book!
Definitely
Am√©n!
Amanda Gorman, you said it! Impressive and moving
What a BEAUTIFUL Young Lady who did not waste words, however, made me cry. God Bless Youüôèüòá‚ù§Ô∏è
Bravo, bravo, bravo -- masterfully crafted, beautifully delivered! Brilliant on so many levels!!! Thank you, Amanda Gorman!!! Bravo!
Lol they get African Americans to speak at the inauguration to fool the world into believing that Biden isn't racist. Oh the conversations him and his wife must have when no one is listening. America are gonna get exactly what they voted for. Not long before they'll be crying wishing for President Trump back. Bunch of double standard fools.
Watching from Canada üá®üá¶. Welcome back USA üá∫üá∏

Some of the worst poets get paid the most
Great work young lady!!! Let us listen and live by her words.
Wow‚ù§
wow, she's more articulate than trump
@Walker Stradley so $$ is your only value 'to a persons success. you're the pathetic greed that is rotting America.
And what an orator - brilliant
Thats not difficult !
@Walker Stradley Trump will be filing another bankruptcy very soon. You can start a GoFundme page for him.
@Walker Stradley you mean the same man that filed for bankruptcy 6 times? the same man who paid $750 in taxes? the same man who scammed his supporters into paying off his campaign debt?
Yet what is ironic is Trump could buy and sell you thousands of times over and not even bat an eye...so what other snide foolishness can you utter as you put your greeter vest on?
A sack of potatoes is more articulate than Trump show some respect to the potatoes
Infinitely more articulate!!!
The brash snowplow concomitantly appreciate because chill rationally interrupt midst a devilish anger. smelly, murky astronomy
Pretty good. Maybe you can do the next one.
Second time listening to this. So inspiring and applicable to any positive movement.

Wow!
this poet is the future leadership
You mean dictatorship, yep just like the Nazi party. Hitler did background of all his soldiers. So did bidentime. Hitler set up road blocks and did background searches of the citizen's privet lives, so did bidentime. Hitler required passes to come and go into cities and certain areas of said city, so did bidentime. Hitler placed fences around buildings, so did biden. Hitler placed soldiers around said fences, so did bidentime. that didn't work out to well for Hiler, neither should it for bidentime. We must never let a holocausts happen again, just like the Nazi party tried to do. trump Life!!

@shotaro kaneda Trump isn't any better but there is no reason to hate on this video just leave or cry we don't care.
@The Lowmein Trump supporters don't want peace
@Fabio Editz She's an innocent young woman stop blindly hating everything like a moron.
They have no heart. Period. And, China is Biden's nation.
I'm not even American and its clear as day that these people are corporate elites. I dont understand how this schtick works everytime...
You most mean China when you say nation
@sick86stang IKR!
Your delusional Biden does not care about this country he is a FRAUD
Indeed pretty words for equality and unity for all, let's hope they come true, and true for ALL, not just some, and not just some at the expense of others.
cap. they have no heart for the nation. they have a heart for destruction.
Black women are pure POWER. This was incredible.
@Miche Yahla Makes sense since the weak are always threatened by true, moral and just power.
They save democracy.... Like literally and a black man save American political institutions... The irony considering how this country have always traited them
I love her words, but I hate that spoken poetic cadence she favors. It doesn't flow organically and, for me at least, distracts from what she says.
The volatile result aditionally decorate because pear directly live amid a illustrious headlight. living, enchanted receipt

She‚Äôs a poet? You‚Äôd never know it..
This poem is soul stirring as well as brilliantly delivered by Amanda.G. This scholar has greatness written all over her being. It is about humanity, bra ery and resilient. She had to inspired by the God to Penn those words which was as true as being prophetic.
WOW!

Poetry is not going to unite this country. Neither are Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. Get ready for things to get worse.
We will hear it in rap tomorrow
A beautiful and fitting poem and a stunning job delivering it!

@Jacob S , agree. She was too flowery. I was glad she was finish.
lol wtf not at all
So beautiful!! My parrot usually bobs her head and dances to good music, this is the first time she has danced to poetry, she has good taste indeed!!!
AYYYY YOOO YOU HE SAYIN WE WUZ POETS N SHIEEEEET?
That was magnificent.
Brilliant and hopeful. I'm inspired.
Respect....!
Be aware, Democrats demonstrated that now they know how to rig elections, we need to keep pushing to get rid of those dominion machines used to select the Washington corrupt swamp. Demand legal elections every day to your local officials
@Ken Havens with all respect, I don't share your thoughts, until a serious investigation of election fraud is conducted, I will still believing in the presented evidence.
@David Fern√°ndez Sorry man the conspiracy theories are garbage and have been debunked. Trump lost fair and square, he isn't man enough to admit it..in any other context we would be laughing at him.
@Ken Havens they didn't, only few states voted for senate, check the balance. Specially for those states where dominion machines were used
lol if the elections were rigged how did any other Republicans downballot win ??
Oh we can comment on this poem...but not the inauguration -_-
The awful spoon implicitly laugh because trumpet topologically pump since a fascinated territory. cloistered, afraid author
Right there folks is the vaccination our country needed.
Yup. Now let‚Äôs get back to killing babies.
@Encore Baby I didn't say 'what the Biden administration would do in office'. I said '... what the Biden presidency will bring." Not the same thing at all. SMH
I do hope you're right. I would say it's far too early to tell what the Biden presidency with bring.
Vaccination by poetry and "real" patriotism.

Absolutely needed!!

Phenomenal young lady!

wtf is that big red circle on her head?
It is a good poem but I don't think it will overshadow TS Elliot, Oliver Wendel Holmes or Keats. I'm not sure a 22 year old has lived or experienced enough to be a poet laureate. It read more like rap lyrics than traditional poetry.

She gives me hope for all of us, fills my eyes with tears for the climb ahead, and provides faith for me to believe in the coming generation's artistry. In short, I am impressed. Thank you, Miss Amanda Gorman for rising up and participating.

This was beautiful
Beautiful!!beautiful
What incredible insight, passion and poise from one so young. She reminded me of Maya Angelou. Just beautiful. Thank you, Amanda.

I like her style. It's wild. Her poem she obliterated. You felt the shrapnel of words she alliterated. Beautiful poem!
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr lol imagine thinking you know more about poems than a national poet laureate üò¨
@Sara U Rolling your eyes at me, because you also don't know the difference between what is a speech and what actually constitutes poetry.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr your words carry a weight few will be able to comprehend.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr üôÑ
It was definitely not a poem. It was a speech described to us erroneously as poetry. How would you distinguish this as poetry? No cadence, no clever rhyming. It's just her out there pouring her heart out. It's a decent speech, but I heard nothing that would make it a poem. Poem is supposed to be more like song lyrics or something. Something that actually makes it a poem. If this is poetry, then the word has lost all meaning.
Powerful..this is America..the shining city on the hill...
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned that quiet isn‚Äôt always peace.‚Äù Wow...

@Denise ‚úåüòâüß°
Trolls like Kevin here trying to ruin the party. Just like the crazy uncle who we know who will overindulge in liquor and spew jealous hatred toward family members who are not offending him. We know these people. They are part of our american family. They are seeking attention through provocation with underlying jealousy. We have spent countless hours attempting to rehabilitate their their damaged souls. And will continue to do so in the future. But at this moment in history, we must accept and ignore them. Knowing they will always exist and attempt to be obnoxiously relevant in our moments of unity and celebration. So give that crazy uncle a few more shots find a nice warm bed to temporarily relieve his tormented soul. Then lock the bedroom door and party on.
@Mark Haunert wasn‚Äôt it such a beautiful moment? The icing on the cake!  I believe she will stay on top of things! üòÅüíï

You‚Äôre right, I agree that that is the most powerful line of the poem.
Davel‚Äôs Farm yeah wow
@Valentino Luketic I personally do not vote. But it was disgusting for me to look at when I seen video after video how he was smelling women's and children's hair in front of the camera it was just disgusting and this is what people vote for ?I stopped voting many years ago but literally people were able to see what he was doing and they still voted for him . One girl even called out for her dad in front of the camera. How can not only an American but any person support such a behavior. If Any school teacher would have done that to a child they would have been in jail by now

@Ronald H You should hear him reading a quote with the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word to the Senate. Biden says it with such ease and force you know he is familiar with the word!
@Kyril Jordanov that's no true.. You have not listened to many poems from black Americans or Africans.. We have one story and it sounds alike in times of crisis
@Foxy Boop they will not take our joy because of their bitterness. What a great day. üíïüòä
@Ronald H I believe in the concept of Black lives matters but not in the organisation. Read the mission statement and maybe you'll understand. It not an organization just to help Blacks. They mention aliens, gays ,poor people, etc.. Even the civil rights act was supposed to be a catch up mechanism to help us catch with the people who enslaved us but it was watered down to the point it was for everybody. White woman benefited more from the civil rights law than Blacks.
Yeah...that part!

@dreams wow how very puppet Democrat you are, the true racist sad sad day in America racist!!
@Denise sound like you're crying to me, BLM antifa racist groups sad day in America sad
@John Doe ok fair enough. Guess that‚Äôs important to do at the moment to unite the nation and prevent further polarisation. Personally I didn‚Äôt feel excluded by her words (I‚Äôm white by the way) but I don‚Äôt live in the USA so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the problems you are dealing with. Focus on minorities is hard to fully understand, also for me. I just settled with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no minority so I can‚Äôt judge minority‚Äôs feelings‚Äù It brought quite a bit of peace to my mind when dealing with racial discussions that anger me at first. Besides that, those feelings really are the same ones that minorities already had to deal with for all of their lives
@Lynnoue Martino "good causes" are opinionated. What's a good cause to you, could not be to somebody else. Just bc you don't think the capital was a "good cause". Yet during your "good cause peaceful protests" authority and officials were told to stand down while they was throwing molotov cocktails at the police and burning down and looting small businesses. Now all of the sudden they want everybody to unite?
Questo √® un discorso che verr√† ricordato nei libri di storia. Come, se non superiore a "I have a dream"! Assolutamente impossibile toglierlo dalle nostre menti! Fantastico
@John Doe what does radical left have to do with this poem? Please don‚Äôt embarrass yourself, it doesn‚Äôt look so good... ooh a black woman saying things at Biden‚Äôs party, she must be a left radical üòÇ
@richard famous The argument of yuppies and faux progressives. And liars.
@Denise I'm living for your comments...no sense in feeding these trolls fresh responses üòÇ
@Kevin Johnson Add $600 to $1400. Get out your calculator if you need it. Spoiler alert! It‚Äôs $2000.
@Kevin Johnson He has not started yet, so what lies? But maybe ask McConnell since the house has already pass the $2000 stimulus which did not get voted in the senate. Biden wants $2000 stimulus but it‚Äôs up to the house and the senate to vote for it. Maybe ask your house representative and your state senator if they will vote for it.
@Kevin Johnson did trump give you 2000?
@joegaud cry baby cry üò≠ aww lol awww üòÜ ü§£ ü§£ awwww üòÇ
@Fuq Utube But I am guessing that was a lie because I see people use that a lot. Republicans like to make people look stupid they'll say the N word and if someone calls them racist say "How am I racist" or "I'm not racist." Clowns.
@Davel‚Äôs Farm wow you havent heard many wow, wow wow
That‚Äôs not wow to me...when you live it.
@Kevin Johnson To quote your president, "Will you just shut up man!"
@DAVID TURCZAK Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
@Swerve Dc Zero white singers? What race are Lady Gaga and Garth Brooks?
@xSinisterKidx Or, they're just Biden voters who thought the poem sucked.
@Denise libtard
Where's Hunter! Wake up Bill Clinton!!
@xSinisterKidx There are public statements, tweets, interviews where he promised the full 2k. Tell that to starving/bankrupt/evicted families, I'm sure they're gonna love the subtle political huckster distinction.
@Tonika Taylor you are so right. üíïüíï
@Kevin Johnson $1400   $600 = $2000. So what are you going on about?
@Denise I concur she was SUPER wonderful!! What‚Äôs understood doesn‚Äôt need to be explained, debated or argued!! Let them have their moment ALONE with NO response!
@xSinisterKidx And even before he was sworn in, he already did a disgusting thing in lowering them to $1,400.
@Kevin Johnson What are you talking about Biden lying about $2000 checks? The man has been president for 3 hours lol
@xSinisterKidx they are so miserable aren‚Äôt they? They can‚Äôt take away the beauty and joy she brought us though. üòåüíï
Amazing that this poem is so poignant, witty and beautiful and Cult 45 decides to show up in the comment section and spread their hate.

That part definitely caught my attention too. She did such an amazing job.
@You Tube hmmm. I don‚Äôt hear 1. Repression 2. Single party 3.state ownership... perhaps everyone should educate themselves about definitions prior to using words and attributing personal beliefs to those words without doing the heavy lifting of educating oneself first.
@Kevin Johnson go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre all here enjoying this beautiful poetry. üíï
@Denise So pardon me if this empty symbolism poetry and president don't ring true for many.
@Denise I'm not miserable, but the millions of families who were counting on $2,000 to pay bills and feed their kids sure are. Turns out they may get only $1,400, if that. Biden is not a superstar, he's a civil servant. He's here to serve the people. He serves us, not the other way around.

@Kevin Johnson we are all enjoying ourselves and this beautiful poetry. What a great day. üíï
@Denise And to anticipate the obvious retort - I'm a committed leftist and loathe Trump.

@Denise No I won't. I'll decry bad poetry if I want, all I want :)

@Denise ....really? With that piece of dead man...?üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Quiet may mean dead people. Finns have found that out the hard way a couple of times.
@Kyril Jordanov No plagerism here... Those are words of a struggle that many of our people share. These are not new words. But this poem is her individual thoughts and shaping of how she sees the world what she wants to see going forward. Many great minds think alike.

The admin purposely chose and ‚Äúused‚Äù African Americans to gain points which makes me want to vomit. Zero white speakers or singers. And don‚Äôt get me wrong. All were great! But I don‚Äôt trust this admin any more than the others It‚Äôs all about how they are perceived and they count on us not noticing that they used all AM‚Äôs for THEIR benefit
@You Tube anything that brings equality into view and draws attention into civil rights is deemed communist by racist bigots. The only America you would be happy with is a white america.
AGREED üëç‚ùó
@John Doe protesting for good causes like police brutality...racism.
@Denise Is dissent tolerated any more? Can people talk about poetry without sycophancy? Have we already all forgotten Biden lied about giving $2,000 cheques?
@Fuq Utube Wow. How very Republican of you. (:
@Dee Shan I have to disagree. So corny! This sort of trite pun belongs with French structuralism, not the vibrant language of Whitman!
reminds of the Rage Against Machine lyric, "silence can be violence"
@Davel‚Äôs Farm You haven't heard much poetry, have you? She plagiarized much of this from speeches of the Obama's.

@Denise BLM is still waiting for a response from the Biden admin for a seat at the table on Civil rights. They sent him a letter and were given the finger. You got played.

Beautiful. Words DO matter!
Amanda Gorman -- you have brought such light into this "time of shade"... I am deeply grateful and inspired by your beautiful, inspiring words. Thank you for shining your light and painting a picture of our bright future for us all.

Isn't this a brilliant powerful poem and poet!
This young human inherently touched me to the point of crying. It was the 1st time in the past year I had a little hope for our youth, this country  humanity. If her words don't move yr soul, there is no hope for expanding or changing the way you think. Edit..LAY DOWN OUR ARMS, SO WE CAN REACH OUT OUR ARMS TO ONE ANOTHER! This phrase should be made into a motto for the next generation.
Watching from Europe. This is the highlight from this Inauguration. Goosebumps all over me. Well done Amanda Gorman.

Hello there, I find it really odd replying to your comments here because I don‚Äôt usually chat with fans but I want to use this medium to thank you for your likes and comments on here . I realized how much you like and follow my channel. Thank you!!
People who click dislike on this should be ashamed of themselves.
From now on I'll just recite my grocery list. Its bread, beer and buttwipes and if you don't like my poem you should be ashamed of yourself.
@(S)-Riley Dunn The first Black author was published less than 250 years ago. Sub Saharans have not been literate for very long. In the United States, Phillis Wheatley was educated and went on to be the first verified and confirmed Black author in history. I'm Hebrew, we have had books for thousands of years, we wrote poems thousands of years before any sub Saharans could learn to read. That's not controversial, Phillis Wheatley was an unusual case, taught to read long before other Sub Saharans were. The majority of African Americans were preliterate until well into the 18th century. That's when evangelicals decided to convert them, that's when we taught them to read English. English is their first written language. They spoke rudimentary languages, such as Yoruba. The reason their languages are rudimentary is precisely because they didn't have any alphabet. All poc trace back to preliterate tribesmen, unless we're talking about the East Asians. Nothing controversial or racist about acknowledging roots.
@(S)-Riley Dunn¬† Just read a bit of this genius "poem" aloud ... "We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one." Um, that is absolutely not a poem, it's typical, run-of-the-mill self-aggrandizing jargon, exactly what you would expect to hear in a political speech.
@(S)-Riley Dunn lol, poc were preliterate until the 18th century, so we're supposed to change the textbook definition of a poem and conflate poetry with speech because most poc can't tell the difference and wouldn't care if they could? I don't think so. Tupac is more of a poet than this girl. Maybe she has other writing that could be considered poetry, but what she got up and read today was clearly a speech, not poetry. Words have meaning, we shouldn't dumb everything down to accommodate poc. Is that what they want and expect ü§î? They want us to lower the standards until they begin to reach them? How about the idea that words have meaning that we all already agreed upon? Don't shoot the messenger.
@dcderrick41 I find it utterly despicable you'd call me racist. I judged her poem, and that's the conclusion you reach? Why? Is any dissent tolerated nowdays? I say that as a proud leftist.
@Kevin Johnson I think you probably would have liked it my friend if you listened to her words and not hear it with racist ears. . .
@cail√≠n √âireann I didn't say a poem absolutely has to rhyme, it would have been too difficult for her to make it rhyme, she's obviously not got the verbal lQ or wit of Cole Porter, but a poem should have cadence and meter. I didn't hear anything that would distinguish this as poetry, as opposed to just a nice speech. Is it a speech or is it poetry? It's not a poem, it's clearly just a speech üôÑ.
@K T the only fraud of late, left the house this morning
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr poems don't need words that rhyme
That was not a good poem. No need to attack people of good faith who disliked it.
@xDarkxArenx it's not an opinion because it lacks intellectual discussion and critical thinking.
@K T lol. Triggered?
People who condone this multinational election fraud should be ashamed.
we are not
@KIN Cryptocurrency Bitcoin  Others what land in the world was built upon with no lives lost and un-stolen land?
@xDarkxArenx No, not for having an opinion. For having *that* opinion. You see, some opinions are good, some are bad, not all equal.
@xDarkxArenx come on my friend. . I know you loved the cruel idiot but don't be a sore loser like him my friend. .. .you were born in America I hope, and you are better than that
I don't dislike it, but I'm confused as to why people are accepting this as poetry. It was a speech, it was definitely not poetry. There was no poem recited. Maybe they are giving thumbs down because a speech is erroneously described as poetry.
What a fragile you are
Oh hey! We both came to re-watch this powerful  beautiful poem at the same time. :) Amanda Gormon stole the show with a message that entire nation needed to hear.
No closed captioning? Shame on you.
SHE IS AMERICA!!!! Beautiful and hopeful!!! Amazing poetry!!!!
She knocked this out of the park...
@Karin Hoffmann , she move her hand around like a clown. Look ridiculous.
@Lisa bbb I'm sorry for you, that it was too much for your level of intellect at once. Go to sleep for a while and try again.
@Lisa bbb Another Karen, LMAO!
Made me hopeful for our future.

Sensational !
What does she mean by 'we rise' and other words like 'new dawn'. It sounded scary, to be honest..
Wow! Words of TRUTH!
What an astonishing composition and performance. Thank you for your existence, Amanda. I am only sorry I did not discover you and your incredamazing words sooner.
As soon as I heard poet, I thought of Maya Angelou on Clinton's inauguration and thought, "Uh-oh," But I'm impressed. This was great!
Wonderful !!!!
This is how I imagine great nation!
BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!! So very well done, so very well said. Thank you!

Amanda Gorman was named the first National Youth Poet Laureate. From this, I certainly understand why - absolutely stirring  beautiful
At the tender age of 16 I believe
THE moment of the day!
Somehow it's like a reincarnation of Maya Angelou.
Agreed. She is remarkably talented, and she is young. Gives me hope for the future of American poetry.
YES THAT IS WHAT I FELT DURING THIS POEM! Maya is smiling from somewhere better today!
I also thought of Maya Angelou.
I thought of Maya also and her great poem "On the Pulse of Morning" at Clinton's inauguration.
‚ÄúOurs is the dawn‚Äù

Absolutely beautiful and full of hope for our future.
Beautiful poem!!!

As a 61 old father to 2 teenage daughters I would like to sent my deep respect! This was the highlight of today¬¥s inauguration! As a German I had not heard about Amanda Gorman so far. My apologies for this ignorance! Luckily, like so many things today, that has now changed. My best wishes to your country and for all your endeavors in the future, Ms. Gorman! Go for it!
@Grieving Stereo go away
@Shiela Nunn LA. She is turning 23 in March according to Wiki!üòÆ

Hope to never hear her again
Most Americans hadn‚Äôt heard of her before either!

@C M don't judge my smartness out of just one sentence and I believe there is something called everyone to their own opinions. u don't like her ur problem. I ain't gonna call a 'duffer' for that so please refrain urself from judging what I am or what I am not just to spite me up
@C M go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòåüíï
You are not smart either.
A stunning speech and performance, such insight,grace and wisdom from one so young is rare indeed! gave me extended goosebumps! What a wonderous and inspiring young lady! Marvelous! The sun shone with her today! ( :
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr No she is a true poet! You just refuse to accept it!
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr you‚Äôre so mad at this woman‚Äôs talent, you‚Äôve commented this under every postüòÇ. Doesn‚Äôt take away how amazing she is
Yes, it was a speech. However, it was not poetry, she was supposed to read a poem, instead, she gave a speech. A for effort, but obviously she's not a poet, she writes speeches, not poetry.
WOW!
How beautiful from a beautiful young woman
Agreed. She so pretty i actually had a hard time listening to her üòÅ
Everyone, speak, Shout a word, because you deserve to be heard! Don't be afraid of the fear that is thrust upon you, cause' you're better than most of all you think is inside you! more power to you‚ù£Ô∏è

lol, this poem was sooo great they had to censor the comments' section!
This was the best speech I‚Äôve ever heard, it‚Äôs literally amazing.
@Nudgarrobot Respectfully disagree Mr. Bot. It used neither meter nor structure. It was prose, ie spoken word. Open mic fodder at best. Periodt. Good luck with your complaining post-Trump.
@Mr. Meerkat "Prose: Written or spoken language in its ordinary form, without metrical structure" -Literal dictionary definition. You're incorrect, this uses meter, it's poetry. Period.
@Nudgarrobot This is prose, which is spoken word. Technically not poetry.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr This is very much poetry; poetry isn't based on rhyme, it's based on meter and structure. This is super well structured, well composed, and emotional.
Fake cheating Dems, It's sickening, fake propaganda. Hairy legs, remember?
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr this was poetry! Listen again...or do you still think poetry needs to rhyme?
@jthomas420 no to brainwashing smoothtalkers
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr who cares man just enjoy the words
Thanks for admitting it was a speech and it was not poetry. It was erroneously sold to us as poetry, but there was no poem, this is just a speech, not a poem.
I can't imagine giving a speech after this amazing articulate lady.
@TraskTalker yeah but that's just 1 story from his wonderful life. You want to get into Epstein or maybe the beauty pageants. We could go on and on.
@Mark Haunert atleast he was paying a full grown adult to do what she did for a living, unlike Joe Biden who can only stand at attention for children ü§∑
@TraskTalker oh that's ironic as hell. Trump is such a wonderful little angel isn't he. According to stormy Daniels he is a " little " something üòâüòä.
@ZeroSum23 doesn't take rocket science to figure out why it's upsetting for some women. Flat out jealousy.
@Mark Haunert Or I'm just trying to point out why this "little compliment" might not be hitting some people quite right. I tried to phrase it in the nicest, least antagonistic way I could. But I guess reading comprehension isn't for everyone.
@ZeroSum23 her passion
@dreams people with a dark üñ§...and iron hand..
@Justin Smith it is a great day.üëç
@ZeroSum23 seems like a lot of people are having trouble with giving a young lady a little compliment. Sad isn't it.
@Lisa bbb I don't think I'll take advice on how to perform poetry from someone who doesn't even know which form of "too" is correct.
She is to flowery. To much hand movements. I was glad she was finish n get off stage.
What a great day for China and the CCP!!
@RafiGish Sadly, there are always haters, racists, etc. But she is a triumph who rises above them.
@dreams yeah I'm pretty sure it's a particular " group ". Very sad not to find joy in this beautiful human being. üëç

@RafiGish I already know what kinds of people downvoted it... (or disliked it just in case someone wants to get technical)
@RafiGishi didn't even notice that until you said that. Must be a jealousy thing. She's absolutely adorable.
I can't imagine that this is currently downvoted by 10% of viewers.
She's beautiful üòç

Nothing is lost to youth. Riveted by her genius!
@Mark Mywords are you seriously trying to draw a false equivalency between this woman and someone who died 50 years before she was born?
@Ginny K You mean unlike disney?
@Mark Mywords you wouldn't know communism if it hit ya in the head.
@Mark Mywords interesting you equate the arts with communism
@Margaret Werncke Communistic indoctrination is great

Everything is lost to the indoctrinated youth
Powerful poetry that meets this moments.
Fake cheating Dems, It's sickening, fake propaganda. Hairy legs, remember?
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr Poetry doesn't have to rhyme.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr it was not a nursery rhyme or a speech if that‚Äôs all you have to say about the powerful poetry that spoke to our country and the world. Well...when Someone shows you who they are believe them the first time.I see you.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr I agree it's a great speech and a great piece of prose but it's not poetry.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr says who? I believe the Library of Congress would disagree, maybe you should reconsider your definition of poetry üòÇ
powerful crap
It was a speech, in no way is that poetry. No cadence, nothing rhymes. To describe this as poetry, now we're describing every speech as poetry. There's nothing to distinguish this as poetry. It was a speech.
She definitely isn't speaking for antifa and BLM
@Black Queen how can black lives matter unless all lives matter? Obviously in your heart you are a racist.
@Black Queen but they attack whites and black that say "all lives matter".
@Black Queen If you're against Racism, you should be against Racism of any kind of race.

This is one of the most moving poems I have ever heard. Amazing, deep, important, and speaking to the soul. Thank you!
@Stephen Saunders I didn't think it was a great poem, parts of it were good, parts of it weren't. I preferred her super bowl poem
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr your post is poetry. It speaks to your state of mind indirectly indicating you have little imagination. Expand your mind, poetry doesn't need to fit into your box to be poetry.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr Revolting. But I'll at least give you this: you aren't pretending to be inclusive, like so many of your belief system do, feigning outrage that someone _innocent_ like them could be so hatefully accused of racism. You just came out and said it. It's refreshing. So you've got that going for ya. It's not much, but it's something.
@Deb Roberts I said it was a good speech. Words have meaning. You don't care if the words speech and poem are conflated, but I care. She wrote a good speech, it's not at all the same thing as writing a good poem. Good poems are definitely harder to write than good speeches, it takes more talent to do what Phillis Wheatley did, than to do what she did. That's a fact.
@dreams Lol, yes, it was a good speech for a poc, since they were preliterate until we taught them English halfway through the 18th century, I think it's important not to compare her to someone like Ira Gershwin. She's held to a lower standard because sub Saharans didn't publish a book until the 18th century, while we've been authoring text for 3000 years. If we held her to the standards of Irving Berlin, then that would be considered racist. I'm saying she's a good writer for poc, they don't typically make great writers. There are no great novels, not even a great film script. Ashkenazi are typically great writers, sub Saharans typically speak and write using ebonics, as soon as one comes along who can write an eloquent speech, that is already something fringe and not mainstream, it's already out of the ordinary. I'm not saying that we are better than them, just that there is an lQ gap and that we've been authoring text for thousands of years before the first Black authors existed.
‚Äã@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr Who cares whether it's "poetry" or "speech"? ¬† There was music and truth in the message. Too bad you missed it. Wish you could see and hear the gorgeousness of Amanda Gorman's exquisite exhortation. You'd be moved, FIRED UP, hopeful, optimistic and connected! It's ok not to get it! Not everyone can. We're all wired differently.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr You are a trump supporter in a nutshell constantly spewing nothing but ignorance and hate. You people just need to come out as racist already "it was a good speech for a poc" - CoolhandLukeSkywalkr 2021
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr uh, do you know what poetry is?
@Randy that's the best a trump supporter can come up with right there. Well done.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr You commenting that under every post won‚Äôt change anything. Go cry somewhere else. We‚Äôre enjoying ourselves over here. üòå
@Denise ¬† I didn't say it was a bad speech, it was a good speech for a poc her age, though she's obviously not got the verbal lQ or wit of a Cole Porter, however, a poem should have cadence and meter. I didn't hear anything that would distinguish this as poetry, as opposed to just a nice speech. Is it a speech or is it poetry? It's not a poem, it's clearly just a speech. Don't shoot the messenger.
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr regardless..it is still powerful..the meaning of it and how it is truly needed..
@CoolhandLukeSkywalkr It was amazing. You commenting this under ever post like it will change that lol.
There's no way this is poetry. It was a speech described to us erroneously as poetry. It's not a poem.
@DukeNukem ...the words, the meaning, it is powerful...
I found it kind of boring but that was just because it took to long
