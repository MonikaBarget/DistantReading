I‚Äôve learnt so much, it‚Äôs felt like a friend in my pocket. 
India, if you‚Äôre reading this, thankyou so much. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I‚Äôve enjoyed this."	5	Brilliant, sad I‚Äôve finished it	Ali Hotpants

2023-04-26 21:42:12	"Such an important and incredible series for all humans, menstruating and not.

I learnt so much about my own body and wish I had access to this information 30 years ago. 

Thank you for having the conversation and making an impact on generational conversations and sharing. 

I would dearly love a series on peri/menopause, another mysterious taboo for many of us."	5	Yes.	Little wonders 1
2022-09-13 09:20:29	Fantastic and informative podcast. Something every young girl should be given the opportunity to listen to.	5	Every woman should listen to this.	Jana Listens
2023-01-23 03:22:28	If you have a uterus or know someone who does, listen to this whole mini series.. now!	5	Listen	Tattoogwendolyn
2023-01-23 01:07:26	For anyone who wants to learn more about the month of a menstruating person! I am a mid-thirties cis woman and I learned so much listening to this series. The BBC has gathered a wonderful, diverse group of experts to speak on all things menstruation. Time to break the shame ceiling on discussing this topic openly!	5	Brilliant!	DStouts
2023-11-19 07:17:09	So good and harrowing at the same time.	5	A must-listen	lillehest
2023-11-03 08:15:04	What a fascinating and insightful podcast. So much I didn‚Äôt know and which I had earlier. This podcast is really helping me to understand why I feel as I do during perimenopause and educate my daughters too especially with the emotional effects each month. Congrats to everyone involved. I have shared many times!	5	Essential listening	Waldeck-Evans
2023-07-04 14:02:43	"Accurate, informative and enjoyable podcast that will help everyone who listens. Yes men allowed too!!
Well done to everyone involved and thank you."	5	Send to every School	Fancydress-girl
2023-09-14 19:54:38	Found this so informative and valuable to listen to in line with my cycle. My only criticism is that the music is at times sinister sounding and plays over quiet speech which I find distracting and an odd choice for the topic.	4	Great informative content (odd music)	piddlypiddleton
2023-05-28 10:28:20	I come back to this podcast regularly, listening to an episode relevant to where I am in my own cycle. I listen to a lot of podcasts across a range of subjects- this is the one I return to and recommend the most. Absolutely brilliant.	5	Completely brilliant	anjdidndnixnwn
2023-02-27 13:48:25	Absolutely everyone needs to listen to this. So insightful and empowering	5	Brilliant	PetrinaPhindy
2023-02-03 13:05:38	Amazing podcast - I‚Äôm nearly 40 and have massive gaps in my knowledge about my cycle and periods - this was fascinating to listen to, the short episodes were bite sized to take in the info (and I made a point synching up the episodes for curiosities sake as well!).	5	Everything I wish I knew as a young teenager!	Another cat42
2023-02-01 16:00:08	Thank you for making this incredible series - India, team & all contributors.  I grieve for the years of shame & pain connected to my menstrual cycle - & for the generations who suffered before us - but am so grateful for these conversations now.  There is power and healing in this work.  The shift will surely benefit menstruators now and in future - that gives me hope : ).  Thank you again.	5	Vital & beautiful	SpicyBrainedC
2023-01-20 05:21:23	Empowering, interesting and incredibly informative. As someone who has been sorely let down by health professionals over the years when asking for help with menstrual issues, much of this was validating, albeit a little heartbreaking. That said, I am very grateful for all the new insight and avenues to explore.	5	Excellent	amy_hiller_
2023-01-08 17:05:30	I am recommending this podcast to all the women I know! I wish I had known half of the things I‚Äôve learned a long time ago.	5	Super interesting	Pixelgirl84
2023-01-19 13:37:12	Great podcast and so empowering for women but spoilt by a complete lack of northern voices (all are southern). Would be some much better if it represented women all around the country.	4	Great but no northern voices?	AmandaK18363728
2022-12-05 19:21:58	I wish I had this when I was a teenager. Absolutely fascinating, a real eye opener. I have a new found respect for my body, and it‚Äôs helped me understand my feelings and emotions on a monthly basis.	5	A must listen	Alioooo
2022-12-02 12:31:23	I am amazed at how ignorant I have been of my own body for 30 plus years.  It‚Äôs criminal.  This podcast is enlightening.  It has completely changed my perspective on periods, I‚Äôve found it both educational and liberating.  I would recommend it to everyone!! I only wish that this sort of information and approach had been available when I was a teenager.  An absolute must of a listen.	5	Amazing! Life Changing!	Sainsbury's Mam
2022-10-18 21:44:51	Every episode is full of amazing information, all clearly supported by factual information. This should be in the national curriculum, can‚Äôt believe how little I know about my own body.	5	Totally fascinating	JessicaL1319
2022-10-01 20:48:48	"really good üëç,
I‚Äôm only 14 but i can say it‚Äôs amazing. Never thought there is SO much to know about  menstruation and bleeding and stuff! 

üëèüëèüëçü©∏"	5	Great	Die Zeitdetektive
2022-09-26 18:20:53	I‚Äôve never felt motivated to rate a podcast before, but this one deserves it. Haven‚Äôt listened to all of it yet, but already love the format of short episodes for each day of the cycle.  Have learned a lot, wish I‚Äôd known these facts a long time ago. All women should listen to this!	5	Interesting & informative	MsMoop
2022-08-02 16:16:10	"My sister recommended the podcast last week and I have listened to all 28 episodes. Very interesting and informative. Based on episode 7, I made a dr appointment and now being referred to specialist.
It‚Äôs a great series and will encourage my daughter to listen too."	5	Informative	Lornylous
2022-07-24 11:12:21	I‚Äôm blown away by the things I learned from this series. Incredibly produced and easy to digest but filled with so many important topics and empowering messages. Thanks to everyone who made this for brining this message to us!	5	An incredibly important podcast for everyone to listen to	KatRose2001
2022-07-24 11:07:03	Everyone should listen to this! So informative and enlightening, at 35 I am learning about things that up until now I had no idea about so THANK YOU	5	AMAZING PODCAST	jussiekg
2022-07-20 22:11:27	"THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING PODCAST!
I am newly in awe of my body. Honesty this podcast just blows the doors off and tells you so many things are frankly incredible. Also means that you can recognise your own cycle more clearly, which is lovely. AND gives you the most astonishing insights into the history around female health, societal views on women‚Äôs bodies and the gap in medical understanding between male and female bodies. Omg please just listen to it."	5	INCREDIBLE!!!	Kate0595
2022-07-14 13:13:08	Thank you so much for making this podcast. I keep recommending it to everyone. It is genuinely life changing. I never knew what I didn‚Äôt know! Magic, beautiful, inspiring, and so important!	5	Life changing	RallyOwly
2022-06-28 21:18:49	I can‚Äôt stop telling everyone about this incredible podcast. Let‚Äôs normalise these conversations! Get listening, you will be amazed at how little you knew about the female body.	5	Life changing	BlakerJo
2022-07-09 14:47:32	Fascinating, informative and thoroughly enjoyable. As a lady in my late 70s, I wish I had known this in my youth, congratulations on excellent work done and still being done for a healthier and happier future for women.	4	What a story!!!	Canoma!!
2022-06-21 10:46:20	Really good informative podcast, I will definitely be sharing it with my 14-year-old daughter. Also, I absolutely loved the accompanying music üëå	5	Informative	123Mermaid123
2022-06-27 12:23:54	Wish the episodes where longer! The music is unnerving in the background‚Ä¶ over all it‚Äôs informative and interesting.	2	Interesting!	Vickyyx
2022-06-19 14:38:48	This podcast is amazing. I love the concept of using 28 episodes to explore the menstrual cycle. I have learned so much through these 28 episodes - far more than in the 30+ years of having had periods. India is fab, the guest experts are great and I loved hearing the diarists‚Äô experiences of their cycles. This is essential listening.	5	This is the podcast you need!!	Betak178
2022-06-08 22:48:35	Oh my god. So many things I didn‚Äôt know and I thought I was well informed!! India is amazing! Well done :)	5	Great	Mixfit_23

Mind blown. Mind forever changed.
Please make more!"	5	Thank you!	kmal5
2022-05-10 09:53:20	I have SO enjoyed this podcast, learning about my menstrual cycle day by day, the details, what it‚Äôs all for and what it all means,  the empowerment‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm 44 years old. Shame (a word I will now not be associating with my periods), that it‚Äôs taken till now to have an actual idea about what‚Äôs going on during my cycle but how lucky to have come across this podcast. Thank you so much to India for her lovely delivery. I shall tell all my friends about it!	5	Better late than never!	FalconerG
2022-05-07 12:08:48	I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one thinking this, but I definitely did not know that much about my body as a female and my cycle. So informative and interesting and also upsetting that we still have a long way to go in society and healthcare taking us more seriously. Thank you for making such a great podcast show.	5	Informative	ggluciah
2022-05-08 15:14:33	This may well be a great podcats but what is the point in the bbc making some episodes show up here and even then not in the right order??? I had to go to my sounds app to locate it and try tow work out where to start! Either put the thing out there or keep it to yourselves you idiots, all you do is wind people up!	1	Wrong order!	Sulamaye
2022-04-20 20:23:32	"This podcast has came at a good time for me and is helping me appreciate and love my miraculous body and other women‚Äôs so much more! So interesting, I‚Äôve not long got my coil out and the episode about contraception really has rung true for me about when it comes out and having the full cycle of hormones fully again. 
I feel very grateful for this podcast and all of the new appreciation I have for my body and the cycle :) thank you India :)
I have recommended it to a few people too :)"	5	Amazing podcast!	jwotsit
2022-05-03 07:07:29	Full of fantastic information. I find the narrator‚Äôs childish voice difficult to listen to, but if you can get past that it‚Äôs fascinating	4	Very informative	Benarchie
2022-04-20 18:36:12	I‚Äôm a doctor and I have learnt so much from this. I love the personal stories, the artistic nature of the production and India is such a fab and encouraging host. It really reflect the magical, incredible and downright normal function of our fantastic bodies! I‚Äôve listened non-stop.	5	Obsessed	wallllsss
2022-04-20 09:39:28	I have just binge-listened to this podcast over 5 days because every episode was so interesting I couldn‚Äôt stop listening! Mind-blowing that so much of this information has not easily been available to women previously. Thank you India for putting this together, I plan on sharing it with all my friends and will be discussing my cycle with my boyfriend too!	5	Utterly fascinating! Every woman should listen to this!	Chelsiedyogi
2022-04-11 13:47:56	I have shared it with everyone I know.	5	Absolutely fascinating!	Elsbej

2022-04-05 19:53:27	I happened upon this podcast and I haven‚Äôt been this hooked on a series in a long time. It is beautifully made and meticulously researched. I have recommended to everyone in my life, those with periods and without!	5	A revelation!	ojct1994
2022-04-05 06:53:32	This podcast has taught me so much, I had no idea what our bodies go through each month. Everyone should listen!	5	Didn‚Äôt want it to end.	KT765
2022-04-04 07:32:37	"Amazing sound design & easily digestible information on a topic that is so vital to those in female bodies and yet still sidelined.

Thank you for bringing this topic to the forefront & helping me fall in love with the fluidity of my cycle. 

Hannah"	5	Couldn‚Äôt recommend more	hkpx
2022-04-01 08:48:36	"I happened upon this pod cast, coincidentally on the day following my ‚Äòlittle girls‚Äô very first period. She was 10 last month :-(  Because of her young age, I grappled with all sorts of emotions as a mother, mainly sympathy and commiseration.
This pod cast has helped me to understand and promote the positive values of our menstruation, all of which I will be drip feeding my daughter over time. 
Thanks"	5	A Coincidental Find	Kazza123456
2022-03-29 16:24:53	This podcast is so informative and everything I wished I‚Äôd been taught about my body and menstrual cycle at school. Essential listening and so easy to digest.	5	This should be on school curriculums!	"raver .*"" =D"
2022-03-26 07:35:14	I‚Äôve been learning so much from 28 Days Ish Later, and I thought I was already pretty clued up. The sound design is üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥üëåüèº but PLEASE next time, if you‚Äôre going to upload in one go, do it the other way around so they play through one after the other. Having to jump back into the app to select the next episode before it starts playing the one you‚Äôve already listened to really disrupts the immersive feel of this podcast!	5	Love - but upload the other way around	tashaok
2022-03-21 20:32:34	An interesting, surprising and soothing listen on a subject I know (knew) embarrassingly little about! 11 episodes in, and looking forward to the rest. Thank you India and team üëç	5	A brilliant new podcast	HRBrockley
2022-09-01 21:24:41	I truly loved listening to this series. The combination of hearing both experts and people like me was wonderful. Very informative and empowering! Thank you so much for making this podcast!	5	Informative and empowering	Perfectlypodcasty
2023-07-10 07:41:53	Menstruation is something that in different ways effects everyone, it's also something people don't talk about. India Rakusen leads us though the 28ish days in ways that are surprising, shocking and magical.	5	A needed listen to everyone	Lillskank

2022-09-11 01:14:33	This is a fascinating podcast.  The music, though, is VERY intrusive. And hearing it over and over for 28 episodes‚Ä¶!	4	The music!	Nitram99
2022-03-23 14:50:06	As a FAM educator, these are topics I cover with my clients and I‚Äôm always amazed at how little we know about our bodies. This is an incredibly well produced series on the cycle!	5	Demystifying our own bodies is so critical!	Jamie M Murphy
