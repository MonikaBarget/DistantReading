 kindness goes a long way then perhaps your hero owen james should start being kind to women
 you misunderstand capitalism
 that is really true
 absolutely the hypocrisy is massive
 your name actually states your a liar hilarious poor poor individual
no
@transwomen are sexist men youre clearly mistaking transexperiences with your experience of watching ru pauls drag race
@transwomen are sexist men all cis men are men all trans women are women and all trans men are men all cis women are women and all non binary people are non binary
 tell owen jones that also dont confuse someone being a realist with being mean
give me money to fight ghosts from the 70s
 you support an establishment riddled with vip nonces mate shut up and go away
 yawn
 what does idealogical mean loads of far right incels bang on about it but its not in any dictionary is it an idea thats logical or did you mean ideological which is a real word
 yawn i rest my case
 thats the problem they construct a world and everything has to fit in to it like spoilt children
@westyend the standard bearers of christian/conservative conformism advocates of short sharp shock borstal policies and facilitators of savile gad hall harris ball and epstein give a toss about safeguarding children deluded little bootlicker
right wing media lol
you *are* the rightwing media
 too right check out the list of underlying/preexisting conditions of those who died of covid19 everything from mental health conditions to broken arms and many other examples between that would not have contributed to a persons death clearly the government have misled the public to believe that the rona is far less serious than it actually is as a result at least 20 thousands more will die before the vaccine is rolled out and noone will ever be held for account for it any inquiry will be yet another hillsborough and grenfell and iraq and libya and yemen and manchester/lifg and windrush et al whitewash and none of the murdered maimed bereaved or aggrieved will see justice
@george bowling understanding big words and being against institutional noncery patriarchal paedophilia and holy hypocrisy is postmodernist theory who knew (fyi hegemony is in reference to gramsci)
sigh i remember my first uni lecture too all the big words and postmodern theorists
support us dont you mean give me your money because no on else will
 an entertaining reply but yet again you let yourself down at the end
@julian morris ooo hark at julian who exhumed the corpse of mary whitehouse and made it boss people like you make me feel really proud of being part of the generation that kicked down the christian/conservative curtain twitcher/pearlclutcher hegemony in which the likes of savile hall harris and ball thrived oh and its youre you sad old fart
 and you responded with an insult just like owen does shows a lack of class
 your entitled to your opinion but resorting to insults just isnt cricket old boy there isnt any need for that sort of behaviour
@julian morris wouldve been abolished in 2015 if it wasnt for the tories voting it down nothing to do with brexit you uneducated numpty
 we should improve society somewhat ah but you are a part of society i am very intelligent
@julian morris so you just see the word feminist and compulsively respond with your irrelevant brain farts then k
oj you are the rightwing media
 simons just a bootlicker for billionaire media barons who dont even know or care he exists be like his ruling class hero prince andrew dont sweat it
 whoevers extracting the surplus value of your labour is the *real* capitalist i say jones should completely ignore simps for nondomiciled/state subsidised billionaires like your capdoffing toffnoshing sycophant self and carry on raising funds to fight the far right tabloid taliban that indoctrinates and radicalises the uneducated ignorant and misinformed
@tony c well said
its all about money of course
 whats made u so mean im literally a stranger on the internet kindness goes a long way
 shame on your brain if you support owen jones
why didnt you just get her canceled
@soulfoodie1 he is not this isnt hateful to women at all
 ur missing the point
 this is lies
deviding
wow here for the comments and not disappointed owen you must have zero selfawareness
owen jones is a terrible human being he deserves no platform the majority of society hate him
dude you are the right
you claim to be against capitalism but here you are asking for money for the service you supply thats capitalism you hypocrite
owen youll be remembered for your hideous war on women in favour of regressive gender roles and dudes in a dress woman is not a costume youre a disgrace
she is not a feminist icon
thank you for platforming judith butler the most misogynistic woman on the planet
when a man can be moved to a womens jail just by saying that he feels he is a woman then there is something wrong in the world
has she ever responded to nussbaums critique of her views
a very engaging discussion whether you agree or disagree with judith butler its difficult to deny her erudition and her ability to articulate ideas in a clear way
great interview
feminist icon gimme a break
sex is not assigned at birth neither is species eye colour number of fingers etc its observed and recorded if a woman is alone and dies in childbirth does the baby have a sex of course no one assigned it
shes never had kids
hows george monbiot ur uncle
every trans person has said i was born in the wrong body this necessarily implies that gender is innate and fixed not constructed if trans people are being honest which they clearly are because they undergo serious surgeries to match their inner feelings
cogent point how would you know you were born in the wrong body anyway its all so full of contradictions dishonesty intellectually bankrupt to boot this is what modernism has allowed such luxurious life in the west that academics sit around talking about this drivel which is broadcast at the click of a mouse courtesy of all the that postenlightenment science technology absurd
camille paglia judith butler
anyone who believes sex is socially constructed does not deserve to be teaching
and i thought sartre was bad
what do you think to the emperors new outfit
postmodernim is a brain virus it infects selfcentered people and generates societal cancer it is an absolute blight and evil it has infected butlers nihilst mind
the whole problem is the subjectivity so how objective is subjective do we have to act objectively because of subjectivity is this right these types of postmodern humanities fields always go in neverending circles yielding nothing this type of psychology is not based on rigorous verifiable experiments one should distrust these consequences of following these ideas will be grave one thing will be the decline of the west
*she* is the actual elitist peddling this puerile casuistry of the highest order wtf is this *really* about
this is garbage philosophy it is one of the biggest intellectual frauds ever perpetrated the fact that people can believe that sex is socially constructed like gender is utter rubbish but those on the trans koolaid lap it up and jones well hes a disgrace erasing female sex as a category is misogynistic
you people are the enemy
judith butler is a highly intelligent human that accepts you for you thanks for this owen i thoroughly enjoyed listening to you judith i wish more people where as understandingopen accepting in this world
i lost it when judith took a sip from that gigantic coffee cup
women simply want to keep safe and to ensure safeguarding is paramount were not against including trans people within our world i would not exclude any minority group im liberal but trans ideology is damaging to women homosexuals and especially children trans people should be accommodated and respected trans ideology doesnt encourage that
how is trans ideology harmful what is trans ideology
she is very eloquent lets just say it is much easier to listen to her than to read her works probably not the same though
total tosh
im a woman and i want to say to the women who feels threatened by transgender get over yourselves it is all social constract do something useful with your life
@daisy bee man woman all this reality is made up and we being tought how to act and think nothing matter just be live and let others live as free souls
being transgender isnt a social construct
owen jones hates women hes a mysogonist
i have no idea if youre a misogynist or not owen what i do notice is your ability to fully listen to trans women but your inability to listen to women you blocked me on twitter i wasnt abusive i stated a point about trans women having access to women only spaces and the adverse consequences from this blocked prove youre willing to listen to us because it feels like were heading backwards and its utterly depressing im gc not because im anti trans and not even because im pro women just give women a chance to explain how we feel please can you do that
@daisy bee trans women are trans women trans
trans women are women
he also blocked me on twitter because i pointed out his unsupportive position towards women i think hes lost an awful lot of support because of his adoption of this branch of what chris hedges calls *boutique activism*
she seems like she is quite quick on her feet and speaks completely normally in interviews so why the complete and utter gibberish in her writing it almost seems like its purposefully obscure to make it harder for people to read why because nothing profound is actually being said if you actually break down her points they quite literally dont say anything are extremely stupid or make the other person she is quoting look better like in the case of mackinnon how did she make her look so based while making the dumbest points its not only embarrassing but also pretentious af
can you interview kathleen stock please owen
@daisy bee as a scandinavian heterosexual male i am starting to feel that i shouldnt really say anything on these sorts of issues
@kalle as a trans person i can only vouch for that
i second this preferrably with butler on the other side
calling jb feminist icon is the same as giving mcdonalds a michelin star
owen thinks buttler is feminist this dude demonstrates he gas not read a book of feminism owen i accuse you of homophobic
im deeply fascinated by judith butler i dont question very much if i totally agree with her but i apreciate the depth of her thoughts and culture and what i love of her is the courage politically in many fields and her total humbleness
if gender is true anf theres no interrelation between sex and personality how comes it judith is nonbinary because of her personality
i feel like butler is so smart that they actually overthought themselves into a rigid ideological corner
only if i could have an intimate one hour chat with butler lol
why do you have troubles falling asleep
@owen jones great interview too bad about some of the comments btl though there are a few that are perceptive it seems unfortunate that the largely ignorant right wing crowd have identified you as a target to get at great work and yes when my finances improve ill put up a patreon stake thank you
incredible interview butler literally got name dropped in my argument with a transphobe an hour before this popped up in my feed
the debate surrounding our support of pornography and the consequences of that are so complex that we cannot easily say its just prudishness or censorship there amidst exploitation misogyny and general poor treatment thats a very real discussion that should be had by the left in the future at the same time how we protect and elevate the presence and existence of other forms of pornography especially for groups whom and people who want it
chris hedges has written lucidly on the subject
her living room looks like the inside of camille paglias brain
i need more content like this in my feed slow deliberate tackling real issues both theoretically and practically with a feminist icon especially interesting to hear how butlers views have changed over the years
omg judith butler is an og im well jel
the first time i heard the interviewer here i was very worried he would continue to be very youtubey in his demeanour (exaggerated delivery constant sort of shouty gestures) but fortunately he isnt as the interview progresses where he displays excellent research and interviewing skills this mostly as a comment to those who might otherwise be discouraged from watching on
great comment great abs
total garbage
@alex turnergoodyear could you go through some specific points id be interested in you fleshing out disagreements if you are trans
hmmm ok after wasting another hour of my life on this i can give it the more thought out critique it deserves absolute garbage yep thought it deserved an entire extra syllable
@lex772 im rewatching the interview now so will post a more nuanced analysis afterwards jordan peterson i certainly found the cathy newman interview fun and am unsure quite what makes so many people rabidly hate him so much he really loses me with the religious stuff though and most of the rest seems like basic common sense without particularly shedding new light on or illuminating new ideas that said common sense seems to allude most academics these days and i have a feeling that will be a main takeaway from my second viewing of this video
@alex turnergoodyear forgive me if im assuming the worst here but wouldnt happen to be a fan of the religious zealot jordan peterson would you
@alex turnergoodyear so you see science as incontrovertible truth rather than an incremental journey towards it
@lex772 i wasnt aware butler stated any facts sort of my main complaint with the whole thing there
@alex turnergoodyear i wasnt aware butler stated any facts didnt she say at the beginning when asked by jones to reiterate her research from the early 90s that shed changed her opinions in some respects thats science
intersectionality and the general conclusions put forward in this interview seem to be based in theory not fact and properly analyzed statistics so i found suggesting the church to me because i didnt like the interview amusing did you want a badge for using the word pithy
@alex turnergoodyear youll have to explain further before meriting a proper reply try be the antithesis of pithy
@lex772 your suggesting i look into a faith based enterprise interesting i would have thought that was more suited to people who thing correlation equals causation
nuanced analysis there delivered truth over sceptical enquiry a closed mind ever thought about joining the church
i definitely think we need to be keeping an eye on whats going on with terfs in the uk i did not realise there was a significant and vocal amount of terfs in the uk with ties to the media and how thats impacting the situation for trans people over there i think we get so much of our media from the us in australia (where i live) but also i follow a lot of openly trans people online i think thats a double edges sword it reassures me and makes me feel safe and seen but it also can obscure the issues trans people are facing in other countries
its always dangerous when a n american comes nd tell you whats wrong in your own country
i would really like to see an interview that includes both judith butler and jordan peterson i myself am a gender nonconforming person (im afraid to use the word woman nowadays because i cant confirm its definition or cis/trans to describe myself because there are people i hate in both groups) when im attacked by some ultraconservative for not being feminine enough as a woman i watch butlers stuff for mental comfort when i get attacked by ultratrans people for dressing masculine but not selfidentifying as a man means youre an ignorant transphobia i watch petersons stuff for mental comfort all in all ive been lonelier since the trans movement started im sure both butler and peterson are very intelligent experts i think both professors have valid points that do not inherently contradictory but i am surrounded by people who are sliding to extremes and it is really hurt i hope that the two professors can reach a reasonable set of consensus that recognizes both the social and biological nature of gender/sex and together oppose irrational social phenomena
 false
wow fascinating take we need to learn how to ignore the unreasonable extremists they are a large part of the problem
conservative gender essentialism and liberal gender essentialism are just two sides of the same coin theres no such thing as cis and you dont have to be trans youre just a female human being and you always will be
as an example i think it would be great if two professors could agree on the definition of some words for example woman is the definition of this word a biological woman (one born with a female reproductive system and skeletal structure) or a person who shows feminine manners it would also help people identify themselves if the word woman is less ambiguous another example trans is it one who selfidentifies as trans is a trans or one who begins to transition through hormones is a trans or one who has completed the process of top and bottom srs is a trans this point has been debated within the trans community if a word means different things in different peoples heads and therefore causes a lot of arguments does it mean that the usage of the word needs an improvement could professors invent some new words to clear the distinction
sources stats facts so fascinating how its men killing and assaulting trans people including trans women yet its feminists who are critical of some parts of transactivism who are once again presented as terrible threats and immediately portrayed as racist islamophobic and so on
how can i be a threat im not even killing you the physical threat posed by transphobic and misogynistic men and the institutional threat posed by transphobic radfems are both real and pressing this is the im a man and i grew up poor with mental health issues guess i forgot to check my privilege whataboutism applied to transgender people by terfs
listening to this great person in quarantine is such a privilege
why doesnt anyone call terfs patriarchs how are they different from priests why do we still think its about men and women and not oppression and democracy

 well this is exactly what im trying to talk about not all men are fathers and not all fatherly figures are men look at margaret thatcher or hillary clinton please dont tell me you cant see a an oppressive splainer in those women weve spent so much time confusing patriarchy with men and feminism with women that weve lost of track that its actually about hierarchy and consolidation of power (patriarchy) and pluralism and democracy (feminism) queen of england is a patriarch by design just because shes a woman doesnt make it feminism right d
terfs are women the men (etymological root of patriarchy is father) are all on your side with the medical executives pornographers and pandering politicians
3
i think i can situated myself as part of its beginning understatement much
what a brilliant interview thanks
assigned sex at birth i absolutely hate this expression
 i think swedish is one of those languages where it is a bit difficult to make the distinction between sex and gender i think kon means basically both slakte is more like family i am not swedish myself i just talk it a bit
@kalle i went to google translate so is translated as kon and is translated as slakte i am not sure that it corresponds to sex and gender in english but means exclusively intercourse not a biological category in serbian
 i dont think there is a matching expression
@kalle and how do you say
 in swedish sex means six
@tom johnson they are countless in the sense that they are not going to stop being born and that their number isnt limited and i know they are rare but actually roughly the same number as gingers but what does that mean exactly what are you suggesting
 by countless youre referring to something that is actually counted very effectively it affects about one in one thousand births roughly ten times rarer than downs syndrome
well they observe they assume they assign i mean countless of intersex people are getting assigned male or female at birth because those who observe dont know what they are doing in fact
ty for spreading intelligence and light
great conversation
jk rowling knows exactly whats at stake for trans people she just doesnt care or want to acknowledge it
rowling was defiending a woman who loses a job insulted by gregor murray polit activist she didt start a campagne against trans*womean fakts are not importend in the gender world as i see
there is no biological basis for transphobia how can we accept someones objections to transgender people based solely on a feeling
lol
ever try to read a judith butler book its like choking down dry overcooked word salad
lololol
gramski was he slavic
if you mean gramsci then no he was italian
im crying and speechless and feel so deeply seen and real thank you so so so much butler 3
there cant be a feminist scholar
@abel abel you simply confirm my words by the lens of women scientific method has developed specifically to avoid and eliminate biases such lenses based on innate characteristics (which we all have but which cant be a foundation of a discipline)
@abel abel you misunderstand my point i dont deny thst feminist scholars exist i theyre just not scholars there cant be science with predefined agenda
furiously annotated my copy of gender trouble as i watch this
 you seem smart
butler is a stupid persons idea of a smart person
ah yes going with the falsity of what the trans women did or did not do at stonewall or how important they were everyone was pissed everyone fought back trans woman were part of it not some special part that needs to be held up above as many now wish to do in some misguided attempt for blah blah blah
judith butler uses she and they pronouns the original she/they lesbian
crackpot narcissist
they seem like such a lovely person
what could be more normal than mutilating your genitalia and speedballing hormones to larp as the opposite sex
the great judith butler is non binary life is awesome
yes it is this is so great
no spoilers (kidding)
for a woman to be told that she cant be a mathematician or engineer or soldier because shes a woman when thats all she ever wanted to be hurts sure its just a feeling but you dont find the likes of jk or germaine greer telling women to stop complaining because its just a feeling and complaining about it is attacking mens freedom to discriminate against women and yet to address a trans person as the gender they were assigned at birth or refuse to use their name is a similar kind of hurt only far more profound and dangerous to mental health
the amount of misgendering in this comment section is pretty bad guys please be careful to use the correct pronouns
really you just gendered everyone with a masculine noun guy is not gender neutral nor inclusive
thanks for this interview i liked that you made space for butler to expound on your prompts a pleasure to hear their mind at work
judith explains exactly how it feels
maybe you should say cisgender instead of cisgendered its not something that happens to you still that was an excellent interview d
this is really great wish i could like it multiple times
years ago my cousin recommended me one of judith butlers books she identified as a gay man then and i was very much in the closet she ended up being a straight woman and i was the gay girl in the family
this is brillant judith butler talked about the existential bind and the desperation that trans people experience she gets it this is the most enlightened understanding i have ever heard coming from a cisgender person i had actually started to believe it was impossible for cis people to develop this level of empathy and understanding looks like it is very possible after all
its fine to live the way you want and we should strive for that but to force others to recognize you so that you feel happy thats just another level of pathetic
i dont think anyone is forcing anything though
i really appreciated this interview judith butler always sounds articulate funny and kind )
w o n d e r f u l really loved this
so judith butler exists but somehow americans keep not electing her president
shame on you algorithm you didnt recommend me this video until today
ive been missing out
i loved hearing butler speak but i still have this doubt what is the difference between gender is performative and gender is a construction
 no gender cant be defined
you perform a ballet you construct a tutu anyway gender is just social norms for whichever sex you are based around female submission (femininity) and male dominance (masculinity) anyone calling herself a feminist should want gender abolished
@sage cugino thank you
i definitely dont have the same level of understanding as judith butler but to my understanding gender as a social construct means that gender is something that takes on its meaning due to the well cemented historical patterns and norms the socially constructed nature of gender doesnt make it arbitrary or not real but rather confers expectations on peoples behaviour based on a largely collective view of what it means to be a man/boy or woman/girl gender as a performance isnt at odds with this it points to the way we take up these cultural expectations namely by performing the role we are expected to the construct of gender defines the roles on a large scale while the performance is the way individual people act out the role and continue to perpetuate (or subvert) the social construct hope this helps but again im not an expert (nor have i actually read any of butlers work yet)
what does a biological man who thinks he is a woman have in common with a biological woman
@lovetoplayguitar hormone therapy is not only able to change the bone structure its able to change the brain structure as well but theres no reported case of a structral change from male to female just because someone identified themselves as a female btw some trans women doesnt necessarily mean that the study has shown data which is significant enough to answer this question
from wiki transgender studies on brain anatomy early postmortem studies of transgender neurological differentiation were focused on the hypothalamic and amygdala regions of the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) some trans women were found to have femaletypical putamina that were larger in size than those of cisgender males[11] some trans women have also shown a femaletypical central part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bstc) and interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus number 3 (inah3) looking at the number of neurons found within each[12]

im happy to learn that butler is my first non binary philosopher ive read its so great having representation of my gender in philosophy
lol
im happy that butler is not the first non binary philosopher ive read its so great having camille paglias representation of my gender in philosophy
in 1998 denis duttons journal philosophy and literature awarded butler first prize in its fourth annual bad writing competition which set out to celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles
she is a woman
the b in butler stands for based
are you sure thats what the b stands for
@sky kid is awesome neither will you troon
@terry bunch you will never find love
@shazy shaze back to tumblr
@terry bunch back 2 /pol/
@terry bunch return to the dark depths from whence you came fiend
you will never pass
judith explains how she hadnt read jk rowlings essay at all
anyone else jealous of the amount of books in the background
robin diangelo had the same amount of books behind her in one interview
my first thought exactly
real intellectuals dont feel the need to do this
deeply but i take comfort in the fact that i see a lot of 2nd editions copies and 1 to s some binders folders and a sense of the space being used for educating rather then a self serving library (looks like a office/university workspace library envy 101
her background looks like the inside of camille paglias brain
@katarina hinsey hoarding means you are excessively collecting things which have no use or value to you i highly doubt butler doesnt make full use of their library no one writes like they do unless they have extensive literary knowledge
im jealous of people who want to and do read so many books
go to a library (when they open again) or spend your spare cash at the book store
jealous that shes a book hoarder no
that many books makes my freaking heart pound
ikr i wish i were also in judith butlers bookshelf
i wish i could like this more than once this is incredible
intellectuals like butler like the trans concept because its complicated simple is boring simple is for stupid working class people working class people can only understand men being men and women being women clever people like butler are able to understand than a man can be a woman and vice versa
trans is not complicated transphobia is
as if there are no working class trans people
@westley montgomery my point was a criticism of academics not of the working class your salary doesnt define your social class butler is upper class whatever salary she makes
you know a lot of (probably most) academics are working class right the average salary for a university lecturer is less than a plumber secondly its really not that complicated it may take time and effort to learn about things that are new to us but to suggest that workingclass people are unwilling or unable to do so is pretty cringe
this is so insightful and positively thoughtprovoking thank you
rather dismissive of the concerns of ordinary women who are being told to share their womenonly spaces with hairyarsed blokes its not the first time an academic immersed in their theories failed to engage with the realworld concerns of ordinary people
sounds like youve never engaged with a trans woman before
we must make policy through data not through feelings so wheres your data
even if trans people only thought they were trans because of feelings that still doesnt excuse denying people a right to live a liveable life basic human rights belong to every human being
exactly even if you disagree with the metaphysics of gender trans liberation is really important trans rights are human rights
the moment butler said sex assigned i stopped taking her seriously
i would love to hang out with judith butler so interesting and inspiring
@nadia bear judith is my go to dream cup of coffee and a chat adorable
yeah jo hart so would i
a very deepening conversation for me there is still so much more to learn and so many old assumptions to drop
@kalle name any three beliefs and ill show you three assumptions
name three
transphobia describes a personal/social aversion or hostility towards people who deviate from the norm in their gender appearance or in their gender identity or people who cannot be clearly classified in the binary thought system man or woman affected people are judged negatively insulted degraded disadvantaged or even physically attacked why is sex and gender mixed up in conversation biology and social role expectations and constructs are different issues every person should live and express themselves as they like if hormones and plastic surgery help adult people with gender dysphoria to live more happy then they can use the advantage of this medical opportunity in which country are forced operations on intersex children prohibited which movement advocates the recognition of a third biological sex intersex concerns are mostly ignored is it because its about sexus and not gender
gender performativity creates stereo types that are instructive to many aspects of trans identity its an interesting internal conflict within the discussion as a non binary person myself i sometimes wonder where the aspects of how my own ideas of femininity are arrived at contrapoints has some great takes on this too
sex based stereotypes is just sexism
woah 2 gender neutral people in one video lmao
two comics utter wastes of space mate
interview jennifer bilek for balance
judith4pm
listening to judith butler made me realise that i actually love camille paglia
i read butler a few years ago it was the worst thing ive ever read i simply dont see how anything she has to say has any value
shes a stupid persons idea of a smart person
i love you judith youve inspired me endlessly
watching the video i realized that i believe that neither he nor she understand very well the critiques of radical abolitionist feminism of the second wave it is not about being transexclusive rather it is about the impossibility of reconciling the struggles of the feminist movement with the vision that gender is only an individual subjective feeling and with the point that there would exist a fundamental human right for the selfdetermination of the gender/sex what these feminists claim is that being a woman or being a man does not depend on gender it depends only on sex people suffering from gender dysphoria should be able to access hormonal treatment or surgery only if their manifested sexual identity is persistent over a long period of time (months or even years) and that the procedure is only performed in these circumstances and so the subsequent registration change of their identity otherwise if any person who wishes it were allowed to express their desire to be a man or a woman at any time and an instantaneous registration change could be made based only on this subjective desire this could adversely affect the rights acquired by women and for their safety in certain intimate spaces or sports competitions i think that judith butler makes very important contributions to feminist theory and to that of the struggle of sexual minorities but i think that the great fault of her theory lies in believing that gender is the same as sex or that gender includes sex and that therefore sex is also a cultural construct instead of being a preexisting objective biological circumstance to which a gender is attached from birth
if she doesnt even understand what sex is and how its leveraged by maledominated capitalism to subordinate and commodify female people her contributions to feminism are nothing but sabotage
just finished a philosophy essay discussing this womans works and i can confidently say she has the worst prosestyle of any philosopher and ive read heidegger
@hkfinn83 thats the standard postmodernists prosestyle foucault derrida lacan they all talk and talk and talk but dont ever reach a singular unifying point post modernism is just one long dry hump
i parsed out two full pages of super dense run on sentences in one of her books and it was tiny print and as far as i could work out it was saying something like things need to be seen in context then it just continues page after page after page of the same thing im convinced half of academia is a swindle some of these books could easily be summed up in a couple of sentences without actually losing much
812 butler says gender is historical formed however history has a beginning she should locate the historical formation of gender and also identify what existed before that
that would mean shed have to stop bullshitting and acknowledge sex no money in that
yes i too am interested in dinosaurs opinions on gender theory
haha owen actually go debate with your opposites dont be a wimp go debate with kellie jay keen minshall or on the mess were in podcast go on
postmodernist semantic sleightofhand woo
@problembeing what specifically are you unhappy with
@charwyrm its not as simple as that there are tenets of postmodernism i think have validity but for a philosophy that is supposed to be nonessentialist and absolutist this doesnt speak to that principle at all its divisive and appeals to absolutism its a confused mess and certainly is no answer to modernity when it is such incoherent and subjective linguistic trickery
i dont like this idea so it must be deceptive
bird or bloke
little baby children can read better than you
little baby children think female people cant have short hair
owen identifies as him if thats what you mean
butler is the author of indecipherable gibberish in saner times she wouldnt work at a university
denouncing gender performativity and jumping on the band wagon of the more eccentric extreme concepts of post modern identity politics cant believe judith butler sold out like that
owen why do you block those (mainly women) who make comments on trans issues that you dont agree with to you on twitter it is coming across as though you do not care about womens points of views on this
thanks so much for this owen and judith truly enlightening interview
i love the video and judith butler is so cool and kind thanks owen for doing this )
i really enjoyed this interview and professor butler was excellent in detailing the roots of what we see / hear going on i am happy to hear that professor butler is nonbinary thank you for this subscribed for more quality videos // 703 terfs disliked this video //
this was incredibly interesting thank you for making this video so many points and arguments i have never thought about before
transwomen did not start the stonewall riots this has been widely debunked by people who were actually there at least try to get your facts right
if a fib is repeated often enough people will accept it as fact
that was brilliant i could listen to judith butler talk for hours on end so much long thought out wisdom there to learn from i appreciate the way in which she delivers her words with a great sense of humility and with an understanding of and comfortability with the fact that these topics are complex and that her own views and those of wider society will and should change over time unfortunately many people are only willing/able to listen to straight forward answers and simple ideas i wonder how can we translate discussions such as this into a form that is palatable to a wider audience
thank u
owen please interview debra soh that would be so interesting shes a leftie who has opposing views on gender to judith butler and you two would make for a great debate that would make my day
@lux l interesting perspective
debra soh would be so lightweight debating judith butler soh does a lot of interviews but have you noticed that in those interviews she never debates an actual scholar or scientist soh is neither a leftie nor an actual scientist she identifies as a liberal which is not the same as a leftie and most her talking points are antileft shes not a scientist shes a columnist with a phd in psychology again these two things are different having a phd in a stem field doesnt automatically make one a scientist she hasnt conducted any scientific research since 2016 the year she got her phd she quit science if you can call a phd student a scientist then yes she is a former scientist during the time she was a phd student but not anymore and yes her actual degree is in psychology not in neuroscience (from the department of psychology at york university canada) even though she did some neuroimaging work (i guess neuroscientist just sounds more legit and sciencey than psychologist) her phd research was on hypersexual disorder (aka sex addiction) in men she has precisely 0 peeredreviewed scientific publications on the topics of transgender gender biological sex or sex differences in the brain but shes praised by the uninitiated mistakenly as an renowned expert on these topics just because she writes antiwoke coed articles a nonpeerreviewed alarmist book and does a lot of interviews claiming to speak for the science get a real scientist/scholar on the neurobiological basis of gender to debate butler not soh i think its sad that lay people think of soh as the first gender neuroscientist that comes to mind instead of any real expert such as the ones she cited in her book (which nobody remembers or bothers to check out their actual papers lol) just because shes notorious and provocative
 i think its worth giving jones some credit hes guested chomsky hitchens and even morgan none of whom can be said to occupy totally rigid and exclusive camps from a political cultural or social perspective obviously you wouldnt expect him to invite someone like meghan murphy or zuby or murray (thats really pushing the envelope) but he does make some effort to debate outside any perceived echo chamber personally id like to see him interview professor stephen hicks but that might be a long shot
@joe saxon you find each as bad as the other i cant say thats been my experience although i have seen far too many people on both sides say that the opposing side doesnt have an answer for xyz when in many instances they actually do
 youre right but its a shame as i think both sides of this debate are such echo chambers and id love for some real frank and openminded discussion
do you really think jones would have the balls to rattle cages like that soh is way too controversial owen jones seems alot more likely to condemn anyone who would give her a platform
two fundamental assumptions are being made neither of which is true first it is not transphobic to believe that womens spaces are important and need protecting that womens sports matter and that young lesbians are less likely to commit suicide if allowed to go through puberty rather than being given puberty blockers and pushed down a medical and surgical path etc second that those who share these beliefs are right wing or hold right wing views the majority of feminists who believe that a woman is an adult human female which is a factual and biological reality hold very left wing views on other subjects
thanks for saying this
youre really shouting into the void there mate pesky facts like that arent welcome in these quarters
sex is observed at birth not assigned
well we do put a name on something that isnt yet (or ever) entirely apprehendable genitals are one of the many factors involved in the biological definition of sex
generally speaking yes sex is observed however gender is most definitely assigned however there are also cases of intersex people having a sex assigned at birth (as well as a gender)
at around 1130 butler talks about how she changed her mind just because a few trans people challenged her does she actually have core beliefs or do they change depending on whether or not some people dont agree with her
better female philosophers have disagreed with her and that hasnt changed her mind
does this mean you never change your mind about anything
it is called personal growth but it is also empirical scientific method you change your understanding based on more data not changing your understanding or excluding data that conflicts with what you already understand is the emotional commitment to ignorance prejudice
i think this shows that she is able to self evaluate and reflect on her work adapting and examining new information and points of view demonstrates how she is continually building on her understanding of gender and painting a more representative picture of what it means in our time if core intellectual believes are clutched too tightly you run the risk of becoming dogmatic
im only a little way through but she seems a little nervous when she talks like shes worried about saying the wrong thing
physical sex is not something assigned at birth its something were conceived with when a sperm cell unites with an egg cell it is this biological reality which adds to the torment of those whose minds dont match up with it assigned at birth is a highly misleading term that fails to get at the heart of the trans dilemma
wow that moment when she chuckles and mentions obama wondering if well need to send in the navy seals to remove trump not knowing that two weeks later well have the national guard literally defending the capitol from trumps supporters
off topic but your channel is super fun btw
sorry it sounds like a load of intellectual word salad which will lead one to confusion and madness one is free to be what one wants as long as one does not hurt anyone and force your ideology on others which may help in this polarized and strange nihilistic times ]
lol for someone complaining about overly intellectual speech you use flowery vocabulary (and wordy sentences) for no reason
what is the deep conflict what is it about for real just after she completely misinterpreted jk rowlings essay and incorrectly aligned the us right wing with uk feminism both oj and judith need to listen more and waffle less i think
its frustrating af being a feminist in the us just because i understand sex is unchangeable material reality and female people have vulnerabilities to male people doesnt mean i like trickle down economics and heartbeat bills
im in love with judith butlers background so many books and so many bookcases what a library
robin diangelo had a similar one behind her in one interview
shes a big mills boone fan
i just wrote a final on her and nietzsche and this interview wouldve helped me so much lol i love her
what was the paper about
@j sauce idk wut u mean
what do you love in particular what resonated most with you that you lover her
now then all you nodding donkeys how about you make sense of this nonsense by the famous lesbian snake oil saleswomen sorry i mean wo man not wishing to reinforce negative connotations by inflicting man gender conformity on her go on have a laugh the reason this great intellectual writes this guff is to tie us all in knots so we cannot question the received wisdom the move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure and marked a shift from a form of althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power butler judith further reflections on the conversations of our time diacritics (1997) drum roll laugh out loud the lunatics have well and truly taken over the asylum
is that the one that got her the worst writing award
@keyboard dancers sure is just taken over from war and peace as a classic
is that really a quote from her work or is it from alan sokals magisterial text from the mid 90s transgressing the boundaries towards a transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity
fascinating and insightful interview thanks x
smart burn she calls transphobic feminists a travesty
well she is correct
mainstream feminism in the uk is only interested in hating penises and forgets about important things like social justice
i disagree with this video jk rowling is not a great writer
owen jones is so deeply and completely confused
that library (w)holds the mandate of heaven d *sniff*
its such a fringe issue
what a vile horrible person pure poison
great talk thanks owen
such a joy to hear such wisdom thanks
that library lookslike heaven can i move in 3
wow im sure there are lots of well reasearched and based polite arguments in this comment section
what could be more normal than mutilating your genitalia and speedballing hormones to larp as the opposite sex
@beejarny 20 silence is golden bean
@gareth griffiths ok gareth
most of it is shallow fawning
oh gosh yes lol
@gareth griffiths flag nonce lol
read my quote from this clown and you will see the utter twaddle she spews out
just went through it rn and its actually rly nice
is it even bad
i love judith with every fibre of my being
@gareth griffiths at least wait until you know why before insulting her
does talking rubbish appeal to you
what makes you love her so much
4500 i love her explanation and defense of postmodernism
@richard stanier nonce sense
utter nonsense
50 years ago this would have been a monty python skit now people are taking this nonsense seriously
@richard ott i am not referring to freud lol
@deomachina i think you grossly misunderstand sigmund freud or did you mean a different author
there was already scientific literature on this subject more than 100 years ago please read a book once in your life
the more i actually hear and understand what judith butler means the more i realize what a genius they are fantastic conversation
im so incredibly happy i found this interview my bachelor thesis will be about feminist theory and gender theory i started reading about judith and her work but seeing her on video and hearing her voice somehow makes her work more approachable to me and having a clearer picture of what an author is like also helps in interpreting her writing
@lost soul the girl probably doesnt even live in your country please stop
@richard ott according to whom could those be actual scams when people feel content or happy
@richard ott if you took a stem of some sort fine but it doesnt make you above anybody who deviated from that you can make money and be successful in any sector especially when you are passionate about it everyone has their own paths you judging university students make nonsense we are in the same boat struggling to make a name for ourselves
@richard ott seems like it does because it looks like you cant read
@phosphenevision thinking and analyzing does not have anything to do with humanities especially not with the feminist pseudoscience
@richard ott user research and service design isnt coding its thinking and analyzing individual and social behaviour and that has a lot to do with with humanities its and incredibly valuable skill applicable to pretty much any project very sought after in huge corporations
@richard ott what would you know about it you uneducated pleb
there is no end to the opportunities humanities affords
@sparagmos the best scams are the ones that leave their victims happy
richard he seems to be perfectly happy with the degree he did and his present situation so he clearly hasnt been scammed
@paul carter you studied humanities but then became a selftaught digital developer hmm i can think of something that you could have studied instead to save you a lot of time youve been scammed so hard that you dont even see the obvious
@paul carter thank you i appreciate this a lot )
these comments the greatest modern scam is the argument that an education in humanities is wasteful klara speaking as someone who did a humanities degree your future is bright if you make it so im now a user researcher service designer and digital developer (self taught) these people will never appreciate what an education will equip you for
@sorcha cartoons well and if you spent 3 or even 4 years regurgitating the tenets of a nonsensical pseudoscience and even went into massive debt just to do that it shows that you are dumber than somebody who never went to university at all
@richard ott somehow the perception of third level education morphed from an institution of higher learning and the pursuit of knowledge into a promised job factory but it isnt a job factory whether or not you can get a job is irrelevant to the value of shared knowledge moreover a lot of skills are transferable across fields if youve spent 4 years training in presenting data analysing information writing reports pitching ideas thinking about problems in a creative and nonlinear way it therefore doesnt matter whether you did a humanities class or a business class you can get a job in any field with the right skills its trendy to criticize university students for struggling to find high paying work or struggling to pay off their student loans when it shouldnt be the students fault the economy theyve inherited is utterly pants
what an absolute waste of time that dissertation will be
thats a lot of preparation and reading just to become a taxi driver
by her own words judith cannot be a lesbian only fancying biological females but she does she is a charlatan
@ac1dp1nk ah i did not know that then she cant be a lesbian
@slade l she says she is often misgendered she sees herself as non binary and uses they as well as she pronouns
@ac1dp1nk she is a biological female
she isnt cis
i dont believe owens assessment of the number of feminists in the uk who are influential and nontrans inclusive look at the example of suzanne moore at the guardian her columns were not transphobic but they were interpreted as such by a wide range of contributors to the guardian (mostly from people who nobody knows) however moores influence power prestige whatever you want to call it counted for nothing what the incident did show was the disproportionate power and influence that some trans activists have butlers repeated use of the term transphobic is inaccurate and unhelpful as was her attempt to link those who question self identification of gender with bigotry prejudice and racism as for her analysis of j k rowling that was diabolical claiming she had fostered hatred and misunderstanding and found ways to persecute others as a revenge fantasy is a disgusting comment then in the next breath butler claims she doesnt want her to face abuse i would argue that butlers summary of j k rowlings opinions does nothing other than encourage gross stupidity
excellent comment thank you
disappointed with owens simplistic questions here not much meat on the bone and stop referring to us as people of colour thanks its very patronising
@orlando098 nonwhite is a horrible term ideologically it places whiteness at the centre and pushes blackness to the edges it also attaches a negative to those without this attribute (or nonattribute as whiteness is the absence of colour) positioning whiteness as desireable which under conditions of racism/ white psychological terrorism it is people of colour waves the flag of defeat accepting inferiorisation as a status it is the modern coloured (how are the terms different) and shows just what a mess contemporary intersectional/ blacklivesmatter movements are in severed from history i mean its so bloody basic im hardly blooming einstein for saying it am i i am black to ones white isnt that easy hot and cold light and dark they balance i am otherwise happy to accept global majority person as a term as melanated people outnumber nonblack people in an internetconnected globalised world who is a minority
it is kind of weird how coloured is deemed very dated and offensive whereas person of colour is considered progressive it is supposed to be inclusive of all those of races deemed to have been oppressed by white people in some way but i dont find perpetuating these divisions to be helpful in moving on whats wrong with just saying black or asian or brown etc if its vital to refer to people who arent white how about nonwhite
@mr nzeribe i think ive always been okay with the term because its inclusive of different races which are minorities in the west and feels like a respectful general term for racialized minorities in the west to me however i also see your frustration and view of the term and it makes sense
@mr nzeribe that makes sense as a brown person i wasnt sure what the issue was with saying person of color personally i kind of like the term but i understand what youre saying now thanks
@news junkie yeah i am really sick of it they try to make us pawns in their powergames and yes exactly as you say try to define our reality f^^k that
@k h it centres whiteness pushing the coloureds to the periphery quite apart from being functionally indistiguishable from that outdated racist term we are not a bag of skittles i may be referred to as a global majority person which is statistically accurate or racially as black which occupies an equally weighted pole to his white
whats wrong with saying people of colour
its not a discussion rather the interviewer wanting jb to confirm his priors and jb making assertions that are not challenged in any meaningful way
pomoism and critical thinking are like oil and water
its an interview with judith butler on her views where do you see it labeled otherwise
sometimes people have conversations why did you think it was a debate
as a cisgendered man yes we know youre cis from saying cisgendered its really out datet maybe use cisgender man or cis man
@pickle lars only female people can be trans men female is a sex sex is material biological reality which gender theists continually claim theyre not trying to deny so stop denying it
@pickle lars cool now i get it
@lw paradis yes totally agree but when discussing trans issues trans people usually have another framework because of their expirience as a trans person in that instance the guy in the interview wanted to highlight that he is cis which was to set the the perspective and my point was simply that saying cisgendered or transgendered is really not the right way to say it day to day i agree just saying im a man will do it
@pickle lars who cares whether a person who identifies as male is cis or trans ab initio if it matters to specify then you do does it always matter and no i dont think trans women are men i dont think anyone who identifies as a woman is really a man why would she be i had to stop and think what you meant
@lw paradis because a male person can also be a trans man even uf you believe trans men are female it doesnt make sense because followed by that logic a trans woman would be male so male person could refer to either if those he wants to make clear that he is cis there is only this word cisgendererd ist outdated and gramatically wrong cisgender is an adjektive and therefore doesnt need to be changed usually people use cis man as the short form though a male person might also be a male alligned non binary person that is therefore again not cis so no matter how you spin it the term male person isnt enough to describe a cis man
@pickle lars whats wrong with person being pivotal male the modifier i like it
 ugh no are u trolling i honestly cant tell
male person
wonderful interview well done owen for getting this though i think we could tell you were a bit nervous (no wonder who wouldnt) some more banter and introductions would have been great so we could have seem more of who judith butler really is it felt very scripted unlike some of your other episodes i would have loved to hear about some of the ways her mind has changed from earlier works next time maby 3 x
why is my algorithm giving me foundation adverts in the middle of this
hahahah same
owen it seems the first minutes of the interview is not longer there this is the part where she talks about janice raymond or sheila jeffries and transphobic feminism could you check and yes thank you for a very interesting interview
the amount of contradiction throughout judiths answers is staggering i understand these are complex matters but she seems totally unable to discuss matters of gender sex race and trans with any level of consistency
examples
you should also get wendy brown on the show her books on neoliberalism are amazing
thank you judith thank you owen a fantastic relevant interview by 2 intelligent people
bulters horrible ideas on gender as performance gave birth to the currentterf hatemovements in which jk rowling is ensnared it couldnt have happened without her and it is vicious
you dont have to agree w the ideas but thats definitely not the root cause of the hate movements lmao its just one of the things that hate groups found effective to spread misinfo about
love you great interview
shut it ya silly fart
fantastic discussion judoth butler is one of the greatest minds on earth
ooooh post modernism and facts was kelly ann conway (trumps handmaiden) a post modernist when she said there are alternative facts
basically yes
@gozerthegozarian xd
no she was just lying
what an absolute load of waffle
i think the terfiness of the uk is at least partly explained by the radical feminist movement in the uk people like sheila jeffreys and julie bindel seem to have been influential in the history uk feminist politics the uk is a more cohesive/collective consciousnessy society compared to the us which is more dispersed and individualistic so that may have amplified the voices of people like jeffreys and bindel
i replaced bindel in a shared house many years ago i remember someone saying she really wanted to be famous she sounded like a really annoying woman
they are blinkered their intersectional thought is very limited to non existent
leninist social construction of power goes brrr
a fantastic interview
this womans reasoning is so infantile its an offense to even the most fundamental logic
to the most fundamentalist logic nuance
male and female brains great now were dealing with neurosexism
if male brains mean a male gender identity then transmen (biological females) are not men they cannot have male brains as not of the male biological sex
thank you for this discussion judith is a vision of grace intelligence and wisdom wouldnt it be great for jk to sit down with judith for a respectful and calm debate now that would be interesting
suicide rates dont change after transitions
@tarmac benson are you gonna explain why
@laurie that doesnt work here
and correlation is not the same as causation
theres one study that says that the important thing about that study is that it says that transition is not the cause of that transition theres a big difference between causation and correlation
this was a great discussion id love to see more academics on the channel especially at a time when antiintellectualism/antiexpert thinking is rife
butler is so not the intellectual thats going to convince people of the validity and value of experts and intellectuals
love you judith butler
great interview judith is so articulate and intelligent and such interesting and important topics
no one has a right to be seen in the same way they see themselves even 10 seconds thought would realize how absurd that is
@jon s it was a joke bud
im sure the person who has read historic feminist literature and whos written thousands of pages of modern theory has never thought about this thanks for bringing it to light
that is certainly an example but you have a right to consider yourself gay or straight but that doesnt mean everyone else has to see you that way
i see myself as the messiah see me as it
owen jones is a millionaire who doesnt care about the cou try or the working class
@zig owl i agree he is a millionaire capatalist and has the right
we live in a capitalist country which encourages being productive and being rewarded for your work as long as he pays his taxes he is free to earn money and spend it as he likes whether he cares for the country would depend on what you expect that to mean criticising the short comings of your nation does not mean you dont care about it quite the opposite you care enough to speak the painful truth and find ways to fix it instead of pretending it just fine
so she argues that gender is not necessarily internal to us at birth and is constructed through performance makes sense but then argues that the condition of being trans is so hard that makes people suicidal and therefore they must be gender affirmed does this not make sense
 or at least that is the proposition made by some theorists such as butler
@soft anon gender leads to the construction of sex is precisely backwards
@soft anon concise and clear thank you
@p perhaps this will help explain money is a construct too the value of money is not natural or material but knowing that are you no longer rich or poor
@p the misunderstanding is the artifical part that is something you are suggesting not something inherently put forward by the likes of butler gender is real and tangible just not innate and static
@soft anon i think i understand society shapes the way we act (perform) our performance shapes how we perceive ourselves thus gender and gender identity is artificial with no material or natural basis its just how we have become accustomed to acting due to society how does this not mean that trans people arent real
@p i think you misunderstand perform in this context it means to do rather than to perform like an actor so its not a feeling or a performance but more like a means in which you express some aspect of yourself and this theory of performatism suggests that its shaped by the repetition of gendered actions within society in other words that the gendered expression we have access to is dictated by the gendered world around us so in short gender is not a feeling even by this theory rather the social performance of gender shapes the perception we have of ourselves and so dictated the sort of gendered actions we might want to engage in
@soft anon but did she not argue that being trans is not just a feeling its not just the gender you want to perform
i dont see a contradiction there the issue is that there is a disconnect between the gender you wish to perform and the gender you are expected to perform butler also argues that gender leads to the construction of sex that the performance of gender around us leads us to classify our bodies in gendered terms so its completely coherent that someone with such a view would understand why a trans person might seek medical transition as well as social
what a great discussion thank you
butler is not a feminist icon butler no es un icono feminista
yes she is and iconic for her massive academic contribution to it that i must defend and she really doesnt accuse the famous author with a huge audience of what you sayif she accuses anything {its a strong word she was asked a specific question about the famous comments and its effects } its that the author may be expressing some displaced anger with sad harmful results and its embarrassing i think shes right
tremendously confused woman
@soft anon you could be right
@andy buchan im not going to call you lazy but i now suspect youre simply not actually familiar with her work and have made a sweeping generalisation based on some culturewar induced preconception
@soft anon no call me lazy but im simply not sufficiently interested in the likes of butler to care i disagree with her whole genre woke is a bland overused term but i disagree with the entire temperament of woke
@andy buchan do you have a specific critique of butler what do you specifically disagree with
@soft anon postmodernism began with some nuanced points to make but slowly then quickly subverted itself into a mire of complication obfuscation butler is not foucault tho shed like to be thought of as such germaine greer is a true feminist is my thought
how so
never heard of her definitely is not most famous feminist scholar on earth nope she begins with the nonsense assigned
 false
@deomachina assigned makes no sense wrt sex unless it refers to people born with ambiguous genitalia whove been subjected to surgeries or david reimer
thats actually a real word i just looked it up and its in the dictionary and everything
she went easy on jk
well done owen
really great shes absolutely charming thank u
thanks shes encouraging the mindset of not finding a better cure for gd
shes the perfect example of how intellect can become divorced from reality and the ruin that can bring in its wake if she wasnt in the academy shed be in a loony bin
stop moaning
hey owen loved the interview was an incredibly interesting discussion im interested in including some of the points raised in an essay would it be possible to get a transcript
dont know if this helps but in lieu of an actual transcript youtube provides a transcript made from its automatically generated subtitles under the three dot menu underneath the video
beautiful victim blaming
angry little boy
can we please have more of butler please
 are you one of those sad sad terf extremists lol
 i feel sorry for your thought process
dudes love this broad
who is this man
he has a brain injury thats why he doesnt make any sense hes to be pitied
gender is a construct of male domination (patriarchy) capitalism indeed it is a social reality but as a feminist (and butler is everything but a feminist as a feminist you are meant to abolish gender not support and perpetuate it
@syd male and female human beings
@jodie roy i cant imagine how abolishing gender would actually work what would we be left with
@syd yeah i am not talking about labels but about about oppression of women
@jodie roy i dont disagree that women have been held back for generations by gender as others have been held back by race classreligion culture etc etc abolishing labels is not going to change bigotry or suspicion we all have to be respected as humans with all our faults and treated equal
@syd hi yes you see im talking about gender not the sex sex is pure biological reality gender a construct of patriarchal social system designed to reinforce the oppression of women because it is that the ultimate goal would be to completely abolish gender transgenderism however reinforces gender doesnt abolish it
trans people dont reinforce gender any more than cis people in fact they possibly do more to undermine it by going against biological essentialism why hold trans people to different standards
abolish gender does this apply to humans only or does it include all life forms
in which world is this person a feminist this one of the pubic figures who made the most damage to womens liberation last i checked we are not living in lala land where fantasy becomes reality on this planet men will not become women regardless of how many surgeries they desicde to undergo how many dresses they wanna wear or how much make up they wanna put on themselves this person causes harm to the very existence of women womens freedom and rights and to the existence of lesbians
no true scotsman or appeal to purity is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample no true scotsman would do such a thing ie those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group for instance in which world is this person a feminist
hi owen i hear you want to get me
i bet youre shaking in your boots lol
thank you for asking this crucial question
 they are they are more wellfunded
better question would be why are ngos and universities pushing pharmafunded gender theism when there are real problems they could be solving
 what question you mean why is the government daring to criticise woke dogma when they are making a balls of managing covid
the question noone asked
terrible interview with shocking assertions from oj and jb we need more intelligent debate than this
so women who have ever been abused by men (its quite common most have at some point) are imagining their instinctive caution around men i honestly cant believe the brazenness of this insinuation owen jones is the worst of mens rights activists he wants to take all womens safeguards based on sex and he has spoken about how he wants kids one day so he also wants to commodify womens bodies for that too will he use a trans woman no of course he wont appalling
@samcad2013 yes it does in that peoples bodies are gendered from birth (theyre ascribed the label girl or boy on the basis of on one facet of sex namely genitalia and historically had their genitalia mutilated where they dont neatly fit into either of the two categories in question) and gender identity describes a psychological relationship to that
 either way it has nothing to do with sex
 gender identity =/= gender expression
 defining women by a performance of a feminine gender identity is just sexism female human beings exist and matter and have their own needs
@samcad2013 so biological determinism wow how progressive and feminist im sure thats going to help a lot of people why do you think we should define gender that way
 we are women because we exist in a female body nothing else
@samcad2013 our ability to define ourselves in ways that are indistinguishable from how patriarchy has defined women for millenia
@samcad2013 brilliant response
@samcad2013 again no thats what youre doing
@c or saying if a lesbian wont accept a man in a dress shes transphobic is homophobic denying biology then wanting to use womens biology to grow a baby for you is misogynistic you take our ability to define ourselves away then expect us to serve you thats biological tyranny owen
you misunderstood my statement but thats not surprising you dont understand basic biology
he wants to take all womens safeguards based on sex um no thats what the terfs are doing the terfs are the ones attacking womens rights they hate trans women so much theyll hurt cis women to get what they want look at what happened to caster semenya for example
if he got with a trans man and had a kid i doubt youd be happy with that but casting all gay men who want families as misogynistic just admit youre homophobic
i was interested to listen to this but felt you could have touched on some of the specific controversies around trans issues such as rates of detransitions relaxing of regulations around puberty blockers etc i dont think talking about these or any of the topics that jk rowling raises in her essay equates to transphobia
@sia janjua i see so you think that any opinion that doesnt chime with your worldview is by definition hateful really and if owen doesnt want diversity of opinion on his platform then he should not invite comments smh
derek spitz owen deleting transphobic comments from his own platform (which is his own digital space) is very different from a government burning books or banning publications you can say what you like it doesnt mean that owen has to allow you to say those things on his platform youre using the word censorship as a synonym for deletion off of a media platform because it attracts hatred
er rates of detransition in the uk are around 05% or something (less than 1 anyway) and the uk just toughened severely the law on access to puberty blockers saying it has to be ordered by a court
@deomachina how so
 weeehhh im being censored and the fact everybody canread what im writing proves it actually it proves the opposite derek
@deomachina owen is censoring comments or yt is either way it proves my point i expect this will get censored too
 doesnt the fact that transphobes are constantly being amplified by both state and corporate media prove that there is no actual censorship happening
@sia janjua please do go on
 poor understanding of what censorship is
@c or the specific controversies youve listed are the ones talked most about by transphobes and there it is censoring what can and cannot be freely discussed basically any subject or opinion that doesnt align with woke dogma is either suppressed or aggressively attacked and the people doing that questioning are treated as heretics and punished for their transgression by the neopuritan mob
the specific controversies youve listed are the ones talked most about by transphobes the main controversies within trans circles are that most of us have a 3 to 4 year waiting time for nhs treatment being able to have parent on birth certificates when having kids and the hope that one day we might not have to choose between having our gender scrutinised by a panel of strangers or being gendered incorrectly at our weddings
amazed to hear her say just like jordan peterson that it requires in part a negotiation with the world that would a conversation id like to see her and jbp
what a useless interview
not a feminist though maybe identifies as a feminist but that identity has no basis in reality
spend some time in the middle east with your profound views
@owen arnold female people in saudi arabia would be very interested in hearing how heterosexual male people who claim to be lesbians are more oppressed than they are
shed be welcomed in feminist circles in the middle east case in point israel also dont underestimate the rise of feminism in countries like saudi arabia
an expert solving problems of her own creation
yay im valid i love this women
judith butler perpetuates the current outdated method of gd treatment
i hope you are joking as you shouldnt need validation from an academic that you presumably have never met
@evan they seem to prefer the postmodernist neoliberal shill though
your oppression is meaningless your validity is confirmed by reality not some whack postmodernist neoliberal shill
wow what a brilliant and hugely important interview thank you so much owen and judith
none butlers critique of rowling has anything to do with what rowling actually said wrote or believes
and the queen of hanmaidens is having fun entertaining her masters what a loser
bye eu bye bbc
lol
its definitely not a feeling in terms of trans people gender beautiful interview
@p an identity crisis
@paul carter i agree that if someone feels that an aspect of their identity is threatened it could be described as a feeling of existential threat however this is true of any aspect of someones perceived identity and it is still just a feeling of insecurity
@p you dont accept someone can feel an existential threat over their identity i dont criticise you in saying this its what i understand your position to be
@paul carter i do not think it is how hyperbolic to say that gender is an existential problem
@p man stop trolling you asked on what level is an existential problem its at an existential level thats all you need
@phyla kupferschmidt what does an existential problem mean in this context on what level is this problem
@kaiissad right from the first of the video not a feeling but a deep existential problem that can end you if not faced either your life your relationships your physical safety or all of these together
what is it then is there a biological or physiological basis
why isnt butler critiquing domination in a culture which shapes gender behaviour why isnt she pointing out that domination shapes submissive and dominating behaviours which we describe as feminine and masculine including clothing which fetishises domination her focus on internalised gender identity without the cause is not useful to feminism it is useful to genderists and capitalism
@v drake and she basically says people can perform their way out of those power imbalances which is ignorant privileged nonsense
@news junkie who is ignoring that the original commentator argues butler ignores common gendered power imbalances butler has covered multiple times in her career that spans over 2 decades all my point was that butler has already talked about these issues before
@news junkie power imbalances along the lines of race gender class etc are fact anyone can google social inequalities of health wealth etc and the information is widely available echo chamber or not these facts are there and widely replicated in all of contemporary social science again i have little idea what you are trying to say here as you keep repeating ad homonym attacks to butler
butler has wrote about these things before perhaps you should actually read some of their books the reality of power structures and imbalances in patriarchal societies is something butler has been critiquing their entire career
@news junkie i would think other issues are more pronounced and visible sexualisation and commodification of women and male violence
because shes explaining the situation to people who are just finding this information out
exactly what i was thinking
butler is a phoney
feminist icon
and he is serious it isnt satire lol
butler is not a feminist iconr u kidding thoughtful women know better butler baffles with bs
5110 yeah its true im white () and as a white person one struggles with whiteness and has to come to call into question some of the presuppositions that one makes as a white person
 whiteness is not the color of a skin its a concept ^^ intended to give a meaning to the level of melatonine produced by your body
@make it perfect murder and bloodshed flows from male culture you should struggle with being male (or maybe lets not play with collective guilt just a thought)
@aurora s we speak for yourself
dont get me wrong i agree that we make wrong presuppositions its just the struggling with whiteness for me no white supremacists here thank you
@no logo rubbish wh*te people should struggle with the murder and bloodshed that flows from their culture its a marker of your amoral dead heart that this is no issue for you dead inside
@make it perfect ok ^wh*te is evil^ now off you go
 wh*te is evil who likes being an awful thing
every single time
@fooling roggie i know what a stupid statement this level of self loathing of self flagellation is utterly risible
my goodness this is a tour de force of free thinking and deep insights on these aspects of identity in our human journey and how we move in this world
trans rights activist feminine icon oxymoron
owen is kind of out of his depth
@dean palmer he always is
judith beats owen hands down in the look how many books i have competition i bet owen went straight onto the ikea and waterstones sites after this i am trying to see if she has any harry potter there
meanwhile back out in the real world pandemic mass unemployment poverty
@wayne gray its a distraction from real issues
what is not real world about this discussion
owen jones im a brexiteer come get me and we will see how much you have to day wxxxxxx
thought youd died my mistake it was your relevance and career that has died sorry my bad
pro trans feminists are ( like the people they support ) confused whilst the anti trans feminists are merely anti men
this was awful what nonsense
happy brexit gammon
what a bigoted thing to say so much for discourses and debate
love
as a womani never met another woman who would have a problem with trans women in our bathrooms this is something men say who have never seen a womens bathroom (we have stalls we cant see anybodys body parts we meet at the mirror and give each other makeup tips) on the contrary trans women in mens bathrooms are risking actual bodily harm and we all know that because we also dont feel safe in mens bathrooms our bathrooms are open come on in its rather friendly in there
 i think youre clutching at straws here i wouldnt insult womens intelligence by suggesting they cant work out the implications of a polling question the way you just have
@p b thats when the polling questions are worded in a misleading way like do you support trans gender womens right to use public restrooms rather than do you support the right of a male person to enter womens changing rooms if he says he identifies as a woman
@mark sanchez you are correct
@bronwen jones im a woman an actual female one places like public restrooms changing rooms prisons homeless shelters and sports leagues are separated by sex because female people are physically vulnerable to male people also i imagine most male people prefer privacy from female strangers
youre thinking of trans women as very effeminate male people on years of hormones and emasculating surgeries basically extra gay the selfdeclared gender identity policies people like oj advocate for means any male person can say i identify as a woman and go any place he wants the world is chock full of male people whod like to get into places where women remove their clothes
meet at the mirror and share make up tips where do you go to the loo barbie dreamworld no one is giving me makeup tips in the womens loo
what you mean no one checks peoples birth certificates or genitals or performs lab tests on chromosomes at the door im shocked
@kavafy the question is absurd it answers the question whether males can be trusted in womens spaces
@shaun dudley that doesnt answer the question of whether trans women are women so it gets us nowhere
@ignacia thanks fpr leting us know we can talk about your personal subjective position on this topic if you want
i have a problem with it and i know a lot of women who feel that too
@shaun dudley morally ofcourse they do every human has a hypothetical right to be left alone and statistics clearly show the need for women only spaces but there is no law which explicitly says men arent allowed in womens toilets and changing rooms
@p b so no women dont have a right to own spaces mmmm
@shaun dudley theres no law restricting men from accessing womens spaces so legally that right doesnt exist its left up to the owners of that space to police gendered spaces in the case of refuges the womens and equalities committee spoke with operators who unanimously agreed that the safeguarding processes which have been adequately safe up to that point allow for trans women to use refuges safely they said the same procedures that keep cis women safe from each other are adequate to keep trans women safe from cis women and cis women safe from trans women
the question is do women have the right to own spaces if yes it does not matter that many dont mind its a right for those who do (and those who dont) and as a right should be inviolable
@p b same and my personal experience tells methe same like do you know women who care this is such a silly argument
@mark sanchez ive seen polls that show the majority of women dont mind sharing a bathroom with trans women and support self id
@mark sanchez you cant guarantee that the people answering the survey think trans women are secretly men the way you do
@allison steenson no most women respond to surveys stating they prefer singlesex restrooms transwomen are male the same way as men
@mark sanchez using a bathroom with transwomen* n ur a bloke telling a woman what women say
@mark sanchez again really because if you ask most women they have no problems with trans women we like separate bathrooms because its safer than being in a confined space with several drunk guys but thats all ther eis to it its not like we have to share a urinal or anything i never encountered this always though it was a bit of a strawman argument
a lot of woman dont want to use a bathroom with males
very depressing and disappointing expecting a little bit more insight and psychological analysis from somebody like judith butler also very easy to call people transphobic
great interview
great interview they are amazing thoughtful and articulate this is exactly why academic and sociopolitical spaces need to be present together rather than separated and divided as requested by neoliberal authorities
whilst the left is seen to be obsessed with subjects that are of very little relevance to ordinary people it will always be seen as out of touch and dismissive of should be its core vote i mean dawn buttler and her lot trying to stop the deportation of convicted criminals back to jamaica ffs how do you think that looks to former labour voters in the red wall
@david morris thanks to progress/peoples vote losing scotland in 2015 and the red wall in 2019 boundary changes the bbc as well as the tabloids acting as the campaigning arm of the tory party labour cannot win a general election under any circumstances and theyre certainly not going to win back the voters they lost with the remoaner lefty human rights lawyer behind labours brexit betrayal/sir bossy cop in charge the next ge is in 2024 and starmers patently useless as a political strategist so we may as well use the interim to mobilise the likes of peoples assembly xr blm dpac cnd stw et al and seek trade union backing in creating a new party that is of and for the working class in all of its diversity besides which the asset rich pensioners who voted tory last time might not be about next time not least thanks to the tories catastrophic handling of a deadly pandemic that disproportionately affects the demographic most likely to vote tory
trans people are overwhelmingly working class and in poverty so fighting for the working class naturally covers fighting for trans people
@gina ritchie gina my narrow point is that it plays badly with the those the labour party need to win back not the specifics of trans rights but the fact that the left is now seen as a middleclass universityeducated liberal elite who do not understand the concerns of the majority of the poulation owen joness new podcast has dedicated to at least two entire discussions to the subject i wish you well
pardon me david but the obsession with trans people is that of right wing trolls like piers morgan and conservative feminists like megan murphy setting two groups seeking equality against each other is the old divide and rule and morgan and all the other right wing trolls have been weaponising trans identity to polarise working people against the left and everyone against trans people trans women in particular apparently in your case david it worked incidentally i am an ordinary person and i am also trans so typical of a white cisgender male to think they are the only kind of person on earth and complain when they are not the centre of the universe
as someone born and bred in one socalled red wall constituency and who has lived worked and/or studied in four others as an adult i say labour should leave the racist pensioners to suffer the consequences of their actions and concentrate on the vastly more intelligent informed and innovative gens x y and z aka the *actual* working class who are already overwhelmingly antitory
this was fascinating and really educational thank you
judith is outstanding thank you for this interview owen everyone needs to see this
gender norms are constraining yes judith thats why we should abolish differential gender socialization not the material reality of biological sex
lets stop treating people different based on sex while continuing to treat people differently based on sex
a man wearing a dress is not a woman hes just a man in a dress
@mark sanchez nah anyway do you concede the point that gender identity isnt defined by gender stereotypes which is what you seemed to be asserting
@tweevle transwomen are male lol thats why theyre trans
@mark sanchez sure and trans women are female people that happen to be trans
@tweevle women are just female people idk what youre getting at
@mark sanchez i know theyre social constructs thats my point as such no one is saying trans men are men because theyre masculine or trans women are women because theyre feminine it has nothing to do with gender stereotypes as you previously asserted meanwhile trans women still face misogynistic sexism for being women
@tweevle no theyre not and it has nothing to do with how masculine or feminine they are both of those things are social constructs
@c or i think that makes most of the global population nonbinary lol of course it doesnt change sexism
@mark sanchez if you personally have no internal sense of gender and think the only reason youd be a man is biology maybe youre a bit nonbinary
@mark sanchez it isnt though trans people are following what they personally want their bodies to be like and how theyd feel comfortable being referred to and interacted with narratives like oh i always liked pink half the time are just pandering in order to gain acceptance there are plenty of nonconforming trans people and many trans people have nuanced ideas about gender
why is butler not critiquing domination which our culture is based on which results in performative behaviours including submissive clothing for women
@mark sanchez no its not as again there are trans men who arent stereotypically masculine and trans women who arent stereotypically feminine trans people are no more likely to conform to stereotypes than anyone else your argument is purely based on conjecture and conflicts with actual reality
@c or the idea that males can be women because woman is actually some internal sense of being is rooted in stereotypes
@mark sanchez when you dont interact with trans people and you just try to imagine what trans people are like you probably will get some misconceptions trans people arent trying to support stereotypes a lot of trans people dress stereotypically in early transition in an effort to be respected but thats a phase for a lot of people you also cant punish people for liking stereotypical things
@mark sanchez gender identity is a different thing to gender stereotypes there are trans women who arent particularly feminine and trans men who arent particularly masculine and theyre still women and men respectively
@gina ritchie gender just refers to the stereotypes imposed on people because of their sex woman is the word in english that refers to adult female humans jack is correct a males will never be women no matter what clothing they wear or how feminine they are because femininity is a social construct to oppress female people
a trans woman wearing a dress or not wearing a dress is still a woman women do not owe you femininity and you dont know the difference between femininity and womanhood if you think wearing a dress is all there is to being a woman you are also confusing biological sex and gender because you dont know better you should focus on improving yourself this year instead of tearing others down to compensate for your own failure as a man happy new year
this lady has no idea what shes talking about sex is assigned hahahahahahaha
 gender is the social construct of roles and personalities acceptable based on your sex female people didnt identity as loving makeup and not being able to earn income
im not getting mad im amused
@mark sanchez sex gender are different
 so if trans people were assigned the sex they wanted they wouldnt need hormone therapy and surgery
yes dont get mad because you dont understand biology
i listened to this as a challenge to myself to remain objective the part that concerns me most are the omissions in the arguments
progressives are famously incapable of intellectual honesty and logical consistency in the purveyance of their various theories of the world they exist to justify and rationalize a type of will to power held by certain subsection of society and little else
sex assignment sex (male/female man/woman) is an immutable biological fact like the colour of ones hair eyes or skin yes change your hair colour wear coloured contacts darken or lighten you skin tone (if you dare) but doing these things does not change the biological reality now before i get mauled by the neopuritan woke mob im fine with people dressing how they want without fear choosing how they prefer to be addressed by others (but not have others legally compelled to) and having whatever medical procedures (not children) that they wish to have to feel more whole and authentic but the notion that one can become another sex merely by identifying as such is childish fantasy the idea of one sex being able to appropriate another (ironic really when woke fundamentalists get very upset with cultural appropriation) by just saying so and then expecting everyone else to indulge that fantasy is simply too much to ask biological sex is not performative
@gina ritchie cisgender asserts that female people can have genderbased privilege over male people its a lie
@gina ritchie people who say bisexuals are untrustworthy promiscuous and cant make decisions what like you your veiled insults are risible i certainly have do not identify as anything bisexual is merely a convenient term of reference now did you want to make a point
 you may not have chosen bisexuality but you did choose to identify as bisexual there are gay people in this world who have been conditioned by religious fundamentalism to hate homosexuality and they do not identify as gay even though their attractions are same sex people who are one thing and do not accept that part of themselves are the reason we have homophobes transphobes and people who say bisexuals are untrustworthy promiscuous and cant make decisions

 many
@mark sanchez cisgender is not offensive unless transgender is also offensive also i was talking about cisgender male identity you are a cisgender male i guess from the masculine name you have chosen to use
@c or i am bisexual i dont identify as bisexual i am bisexual its not something that i have chosen and it certainly does not define who i am not sure what your point is or what sexuality has to do with biological sex would you like to explain
@c or i dont want anyone to be unsafe i guess it comes down to what your definition of safe is mine is equality of opportunity and freedom of expression i do not consider having ones opinions challenged or to be disagreed with or to be offended to be unsafe it is however unsafe for people to challenge crt in many workplaces and on social media and where exactly did i say that people should not have the right and freedom to be who that want to be without fear please quote me
those ideas dont fit together very well you want trans people to be safe to do what they want and to be able to ask to be referred to how they want but also for nobody to have to respect that if people have personal freedom to discriminate trans folk arent going to be safe
@mark sanchez actually everyone has the opportunity to be trans and plenty of identity words come with oppression thats not rare at all eg calling myself gay implies that i accept that society doesnt see me as straight and that i only got marriage rights in the last decade yet still identify as gay which is true
@gina ritchie female humans have never been given the opportunity to identify as a gender theyre been subject to sexism because of their you guessed it biological sex cisgender is profoundly offensive because it implies those same people identify with their subjugation
derek all of the characteristics you mention hair eyes and skin change naturally over a lifetime and even with the seasons also change over the generations white people are brown people who lost the melanin in their skin when they moved away from the equator and white people can have brown babies you are not a biologist nor a geneticist you dont have the education to make your concrete assertions about biological reality you are right how you choose to dress is your decision and if you want to identify as cisgender i accept that for me it would be a childish fantasy to live like you but if this is a feeling you have if you need to live and identify as a cisgender male to feel whole and authentic i respect that if you want to believe that is a biological fact to confirm your gender identity i support you but if you seek to force this ideology on me then you are breaking the golden rule and you already know what you say is wrong because you anticipated being corrected you are on a left wing channel shaming others for empathy education and enlightenment what is it about personal growth in others that you find so intimidating noone has ever said biological sex is merely a construct is merely performative or merely choice demanding that sex and gender are identical is not supported by biological fact you cannot demonstrate that identity is found in the reproductive function of a human being any more than you can show love residing in the heart or instincts being in the guts etc your biological reality is just superstition happy new year
gender is system judith and gender bending swapping non conforming still does not deal with sex based rights of women related to reproduction menstruation birthing motherhood etc
@tweevle reproductive rights are sex based sex separated intimate spaces and sports are sex based rights
@joanna pinkiewicz i agree i didnt mean to suggest that butler conflates the two that would be difficult seeing that she is advocating that gender is a performative but i do find that in the general conversation there is a tendency to use the words interchangeably
@tweevle sex entered anti discrimination acts as a protected category in recognition that women that women had no equal participation in public cultural and political life also to prevent sexual discrimination (it did get used by men occasionally as anything that women have not clearly defined as pertaining the female sex) when gender identity entered the legislation it created conflict of rights for women in regards to protections based on their sex and gender identity which is internal personal and shifting hence the term sex based rights is a term clearly differentiating rights of female sex based on biological sex not gender
@honeychurchgipsy6 i dont think butler conflates sex and gender thats not the issue here she fails to critique roots of gender behaviours in a culture based on domination her answer seems to be in choice as in we all have a choice to adopt gender expression we want as i dont have a problem with that per se it is not a solution for women if they seek liberation from male domination economic spiritual political sexual reproductive
@honeychurchgipsy6 yeah my point was that if sexbased rights are a thing (as the term only ever came into use very recently as a dogwhistle to trans exclusion) thats bad and they should be extended to everyone not be protected as sexbased similarly everyone should have the right to bodily autonomy and free accessible and safe healthcare that addresses their needs regardless of their sex do you not agree
@tweevle i notice that you declare that there is no such thing as sex based rights and then go on to mention one the right to vote or not based upon a persons biological sex it might surprise you to learn that there are still vast swathes of this earth in which a persons rights are very much dependant upon their biological sex oh and right now in the us a lot of religious nut jobs are attempting to remove a womans rights to safe abortion and contraception note i say safe abortion because we all know that changing the law will not prevent women trying to end an unwanted pregnancy it will only make the process illegal and dangerous note also that none of these rights is connected to gender identity as such a person might identify as female but unless they have a womb and ovaries they are not ever going to have to deal with an unwanted pregnancy or a lack of sanitary products during a period reversing the argument a woman might identify as male but unless they have a prostrate they will not be at risk of getting prostrate cancer my intention is not to dismiss a persons right to identify as they wish but to make a distinction between biological sex and gender and to explain that rights and health matters differ whether you are biologically male or female
theres no such thing as sexbased rights we all have rights because were people not because were one sex or another i guess you could argue that the right to vote was a sexbased right for men but i dont think we want to go back to that
@joanna pinkiewicz i once read a book that made the same point i used it for an undergrad essay in english lit (where i have also come across judith butler) wish i could remember the title perhaps the issue is with the incorrect usage of gender and sex to mean the same thing when i grew up there were transsexual people but we did not hear the term transgender
so gender labeling can be traumatic and using the word white as a negative label is fine explain
gender dysphoria
jk rowling author of adrian mole and the worst witch academy is a great writer i read the first of the potter series in the late 1990s and cringed throughout there wasnt an original idea in it it was like a recap of every childrens novel id read up to that point i think shes little more than a plucky plagiarist who was exceptionally lucky to even be noticed in the publishing world but each to their own probably using her time in woke jail to write her autobiography which will doubtlessly be entitled my struggle (with muggles) in all seriousness though i think her real motivation in attacking transfolk is attentionseeking to sell books (as robert galbraith most recently oh the irony) its nothing more than a marketing strategy but given her habit of retroactively reassigning her characters sexuality and ethnicity in line with whatevers trendy i wont be the least surprised when she (eventually) reveals that the boy who lived under the stairs was a trans anne frank all along
 youre clearly triggered by any criticism of jk rowling specifically her harry potter books evidenced by the fact youre still attacking me 48 hours after i posted my original comment not sure where you get the idea that ive never been published as ive not mentioned it but youre wrong on that score too best get back to your fantasising and leave the sociopolitical issues to to the grown ups dumblebore
 my favourite author white knight stalking what are you jibberjabbering on about why are you so obsessed with rowling anyway you write like an angsty sixth formerno surprise that youve never been published grow up you silly little girl
 confused it is not me who does not understand intertextual and intersubjective influences within the creative process nor is it my fault that your favourite author lacks the skill and dexterity to disguise these influences to anyone who has ever read *anything else* before angry your relentless white knight stalking of a person who dared criticise your fantasyland facilitator is testament to your perpetually vexed and apoplectic demeanour not mine i know that its so common a personality trait with harry potter stans and other types of bedroom dwelling incel theres little point disguising it but you really shouldnt project and dissemble to compensate
 incidentally what are *your* literary credentials and what do you say to the substance of my original comment
@blutgeist indra yes indeed clearly a very angry and confused person cheers
 someone who calls themselves liar is a waste of time talking to
 i refer you to my previous comment
 ^^^ triggered potter stan
 so you dont have a literature degree and you have no real experience of being published or the publishing industry i rest my case
 not that its any of your business but i have a ba in professional writing a bit of a mickey mouse degree although the course content was satisfactory and it covered the publishing industry obviously and im an author of fiction for children and young adults my youtube name is an anagram of eric blair aka george orwell and stan is a portmanteau of stalker and fan would you like me to spoon feed any more information into your tabloid indoctrinated cranium or are you done being publicly humiliated
 whats a harry potter stan doesnt know anything about literature or the publishing industry ok where did you get your literature degree and where did you get your vast publishing experience you dont need to be specific or you could just troll off you sad sack i suppose your name is purposefully apt
 not entirely sure how my commentary qualifies me as a troll but id say its glaringly obvious that youre a triggered harry potter stan who doesnt know anything about literature or the publishing industry
thanks for the book report liar
 i see now you are a troll and not a very skilled one either
i have no idea why butler is introduced as the most famous feminist perhaps thats according to owen not to women concerned with liberation of women
@joanna pinkiewicz shes pretty well known in the literary criticism field but that is i agree very different from the women who fought publicly for womens rights such as betty freidan or gloria steinem
distrust the government avoid mass media fight the lies
who on earth is owen jones
the part where they talk about some people not being bothered by gender and just going along with it really resonates with me it also initially lead me to be a little bit transphobic in a transmedicalist way before eventually realising i was wrong and also realising im non binary myself im nb in a way where gender doesnt matter to me and a lot of it doesnt fit with the way i view myself
@honeychurchgipsy6 thats a really nice vision for the future tbh i hope we can get there its complicated to look at your own feelings of gender its possible of course to be a man or a woman and have any interests appearance etc but its also very natural for how well we fit or dont fit into stereotypes to impact how we feel about gender and ourselves a few things to think about if you had never been told you were a woman would you have been drawn to that identity is your experience of gender one of habit or intention if you think of your best self the person you want to be is it more affirming to see yourself as a particular gender or not does seeing yourself as a particular gender feel like an extra step putting something on top of who you are naturally for myself i feel freer and more empowered when i dont identify with gender (but most people in my life see me as a gay man and im comfortable with that)
@c or thanks for that ive been thinking a lot about how i think of myself lately and how i know whether i am a woman or a man ( i can know that i am biologically female of course by self examination lol) of course when i grew up in the 60s and 70s men and women lead very separated/demarcated lives my dad worked away my mum was at home looking after us i automatically identified with my mum ie as a woman but since i only had what society told me about being a girl i had to go with that i never had much in the way of maternal feelings (despite my mum being the opposite and loving babies) i love animals but babies yuk whereas my sister longed for a baby and helped with any babies that came to stay if this means that i am not typically feminine (i also hate nail varnish high heels and spending time gossiping about fashion and hair styles) then what does that mean all of those things (apart perhaps from the maternal thing) are created by society so i have come full circle with not knowing why we need to have a label for not fitting with what is only a superficial/created thing i see a future where no one gives a flying f what gender we are (in fact gender wont be a thing because it will be as normal for a biological male to wear make up as it is for a biological female to hate it) and no one will care who you love we will drop gender pronouns all together and simply answer the question who are you with the words im gillian/tom/alex/ etc
@honeychurchgipsy6 nonbinary means a person doesnt identify as completely a man or a woman whatever my personal opinions on gender i cant accept a stance that undermines other peoples experiences but for me personally i am much happier when i do not try to slot myself into the binary so nonbinary is a personal thing but the idea youre referring to is something ive seen before maybe called gender abolition
@mikey moonshine o_o i wonder if you have misunderstood pacufkas comment i didnt see it as an attempt to invalidate you but i might be wrong of course i really have trouble with the non binary thing i dont really understand it and i really want to if it means simply not buying in to what society thinks we should be and do if we are a woman or a man then i am non binary if it means that we dont see everyone as belonging to a discreet group that is either 100% male or 100% female then again thats me so is it simply a stance a position that says i disagree that we all identify with what society sees as male or female if so then hopefully it will not be required in the future (i am an optimist lol) what i suspect/hope is that in the future we will all just identify by our name we wont feel the need to say i am a woman or i am a trans woman people can get to know us if they want that information this would mean that the concept of non binary and trans gender would die out of course we would still have trans sexual people but thats totally different
@pacufka did the majority of people grow up with body dysphoria i didnt think that worth mentioning but seeing as you came here to invalidate me i also have that am i trans enough for you now do i meet your standards for my own identity and view of myself
the majority of people isnt bothered by gender believe it or not we usually see ourselves as people
we stan
to be fair to judith butler shes not calling for people to be cancelled who dont agree with her ie when she was referring to jk rowlings views on trans issues
@ignacia the truth
@gozerthegozarian could you explain to me which part of what i said is false jkr has not harassed nor denied the rights of anyone didnt exploit the fears of a minority and didnt lie whats so hateful about a woman stating the truth
@ignacia that is not what jkr did stop it with the disingenuousness it isnt cute
@jeremy dobson she/he doesnt know me i just happen to think rowling/galbraith is an opportunistic selfaggrandising bully and coward as well as an unoriginal writer
 lower than vermin are you serious she merely disagrees with you
@sdrawkcabuk worries that a strawmans gonna pretend to be a strawwoman so he can piss standing up in the strawwomens toilets is hardly an issue the fact she/he doesnt need the money or fame makes her exploitation of the issue worse
 i think shes sold all the books she needs ever considered that she chose to comment because she cares about the issue
 knowingly exploited the fears of a tiny minority of vulnerable women are not a minority or are we talking about another minority that is not even mentioned in the book which is based on real life nothing wrong with writing about that if some people who are not women feel victimized by it maybe they should reconsider their thought process because theyre not the victim here
@ignacia never said that was the reason though did i rowling is lower than vermin because she knowingly exploited the fears of a tiny minority of vulnerable people in order to sell more books maybe learn to read a comment before replying
 i didnt know that stating the material reality of half of the population was being lower than vermin
 all she did was say that being female is related to being a woman youre the one who gets irrationally angry when women say things you dont agree with
 youre confusing fiction with reality thats what psychopaths do be careful
rich people dont get cancelled they get book deals tv interviews radio host slots green room season tickets to review tabloid news et al consequences for ones actions is for little people aka the working class whereas rowling knowingly exploited the fears of a tiny minority of vulnerable people in order to sell more books including those she writes under a male pseudonym shes lower than vermin
may i request more interviews with philosophers like this so many amazing contemporary philosophers working on pressing issues which ought to be discussed
 its lovely that when i see comments like these they are rarely ever backed up with substantive criticisms or counterarguments
lol she talks clap trap
i suggest third wave feminist gayle rubin if only to answer the conundrum about whether when she calls josephine butler a religious hysteric for bringing age of consent laws in to curb child prostitution markets (as she does in thinking sex alongside wt stead for his series detailing the horror of such markets) we should count it as either progress or regress
 have you read those
 frames of war and precarious life are absolutely brilliant and lucidly written books with deep meditations on ethics and its relation to politics i havent been interested in the books butler wrote that are always mentioned in connection with her
 thankfully plenty on the left do see butlers waffle for the nonsense it is id be mortified if this was the best the left had on offer thankfully its not
from a right wing perspective its brilliant and encouraging to see how shallow incoherent and dishonest great progressive minds on the left truly are
blaire white says she agrees with jk rowling
so shes a rightwinger who a lot of trans people dislike
blaire white spends her time bullying other trans people and lying
blaire white also agrees with donald trump
i love judith butler
of course you do bradley her brand of feminism asks nothing of you
3
judith butler reading right out of the mra playbook and calling it feminism is bewildering
thank you for sharing this owen as a trans woman i was interested to listen to this interview judith butler is a very intelligent and thoughtful person and i like the way you allow her to speak in a detailed way lots of interesting topics covered and ideas shared
@ fafo but just to be clear you do associate being a man or woman with stereotypes
just sending a little support because the trolls seem to have singled you out
@mark sanchez thats the conundrum we find ourselves in of course they are but if we move away from essentialism these categories will lose their power and can finally become obsolete ps ive talked to u before i hope u begin to seek out answers for urself because sometimes the just asking questions stance can be misinterpreted as ignorance
@ fafoarent gender roles oppressive though
@mark sanchez subjective realisation of fitting into perceived slot in the spektrum of gender and gender expression followed by intrasubjective recognition as fitting the role for that slot
@grace stiletto heels
@mark sanchez lipstick eyeshadow and long hair no
@mark sanchez vagine
thats because the weasel was terrified of her and saying the wrong thing funnily enough jb seemed cool enough about people not using correct descriptions of her on the other hand poor owen wouldnt be as magnanamous he was super cringe here
what makes someone a woman
feminist icon
glad to see im not the only one suffering this tripe in an attempt to understand the other side
surprised this comment has lasted 12 hours
he said it with a straight face too
to judge adults by how they want to relate to other adults is ridiculous
@asher t tenuous that same basis can be seen in straight people with no desire to transition but also primarily in gay people the neuroscientist gina rippon has discussed how she often gets transpeople looking for scans to try and demonstrate they have a trans brain and shes said they cant give these people what theyre after
@news junkie you keep mentioning scandinavia are you referencing the socalled gender equity paradox which is the phenomenon where countries with the highest gender equity scores as measured by the un have lower ratios of femaletomale stem graduates than those with lower gender equity scores if you are and you are attributing this to biologically rooted differences in preferences then explain why when considering rates of *enrolment* there is no paradox (gender ratios of those enrolling onto stem courses in different countries correlate positively to those countries gender equity scores as wed expect)
@news junkie women are vastly under represented in both the most dangerous jobs and the manual trades because man tend to be interested in things and women people i submit to you that this is far far more because of socially constructed notions of masculinity and femininity than with biology nowhere is the most expressed than in the most gender equal counties such as those in scandinavia i believe youre referencing the socalled gender equity paradox correct the problem with this talking point is that as i mentioned there is no paradox when considering rates of *enrolment* onto stem courses only when considering *graduation*
@news junkie theres a reason why men in stem and its largely due to biology whats your basis for this the socalled gender equity paradox talking point which overlooks that actually there is no inverse correlation between the gender ratio of those *enrolling* onto stem courses in a given country and that countrys gender equity score and that theres only such a correlation when one looks at stem *graduates*
@news junkie no it doesnt matter at all science make only descriptive claims science cannot tell how humans act and recognize themselves in the world
@news junkie we dont base human relations in science
@news junkie if scientism didnt need social enforcement you wouldnt pretend to be afraid of losing the pseudoscientific worldview you hold in the first place 3
@news junkie its interesting how you see scientific fact as the direct opposite of a socially enforced reality
@asher t nope no such thing as lady brains
@news junkie look up brain sex and its relation to trans people theres a biological basis
@news junkie agree with this i wasnt completely sold on some of judiths arguments gender norms may be a social construction and change over time but gender isnt gender is a scientific/biological fact
this is a feminist another term has its meaning eviscerated
 trans women dont pose a statistically significant threat to cis women also why not argue for racial segregation on the basis of protecting white womens right to privacy which is otherwise compromised by allowing black women into their spaces it makes about as much sense
 allowing male people to selfdeclare their way into womens spaces removes female peoples right to privacy and safety from male people
@mark sanchez being inclusive of trans women =/= prioritising transgender males its not a zerosum game
@gina ritchie if your version of feminism centers male bodies its not actually feminism prioritizing transgender males is doing just that
all successful political movements are broad churches and complex alliances militants like you who do not accept any other version of the truth and need to use violent images to express that are the problem
regarding trans rights the issue isnt what someone like jk rowling has or hasnt said she may be right or wrong ive read the opinions of respected biologists (eg jerry coyne) who says shes factually correct and others who say shes mistaken the issue is in how one responds to such arguments there is an authoritarian glee with which some people put down those they accuse of being discriminatory gone is any nuanced argument instead in the case of rowling its ban her books etcthis isnt a sensible or intelligent way for adults to behave
@kavafy calling her a terf repeating trans women are women and telling her to sick girl ducks doesnt amount to having factual mistakes pointed out to her thats all tras ever do
i dont think thats the problem with rowling though shes being doing this for years and had her factual mistakes pointed out to her a million times after a certain point it goes beyond just making arguments and it becomes using a privileged position as a celebrity to endorse oppression jerry coyne isnt an expert on trans or gender issues in general so i dont think that using him works either
we are in a time where we cant disagree or give opinions that dont match what a certain group believes especially when those opinions come from a womans mouth
has this woman had children those of us who have been pregnant and have ultrasounds to check on the foetus know that sex isn t assigned at birth ultrasounds can tell the sex of a foetus before it is born and the only complexity that biologists talk about is the consequent ion variability resulting from disorders of foetal sexual development know as intersex to the lay person and evolution by natural selection didnt just act on every part of our body but exclude our brains while there is significant overlap in traits expressed as function of brains there are also traits that are more common in one sex than another and while conservatives have throughout history sought to stamp everyone from either sex with those traits feminism fought to release women and men from that presupposition to free everyone to express their own psychological make up that feminists embraced the blank slate idea was a mistake politically and because it isnt factually true that feminism used the word gender to describe the norms conservatives were trying to impose on us all that we wished to free ourselves from if we didnt fit the norm was also a mistake because its morphed into being some kind of category now by trans activists who seek to emulate this norm i dont care if people have a kink where they want to emulate someone of the opposite sex it still doesnt make hem a member if that sex i feel sad for people who look down at their bodies and think that their body is wrong and suffer dysphoria because of it but i dont think the solution to body dysmorphia is to cut parts of it off just like i dont think people who believe they shouldnt have a limb should be accommodated by surgeons removing said healthy limb even if i end up in the minority and our societies do pass laws to allow people to amputate body parts to satisfy their psychological needs i will certainly never stop fighting to prevent or reverse any laws that allow children to do it to themselves thats my line in the sand and if you disagree bite me
if you havent heard of her i bet youd like marry harrington
@kavafy gender is the social meaning given to biological sex differences leaves are not roots but show me a flourishing tree cut off from its roots
biological sex is not the same thing as gender though
not biting agreeing
excellent
it also doesnt matter whether you personally agree with trans people medically transitioning because its overwhelmingly the correct course of action and results in trans people leading happier lives thats scientifically agreed on across the world
sex assigned at birth refers more to the birth certificate etc we obviously know their body exists prior to birth
beware of terfs in the comments sadly but not unexpected given the one name in the title thanks for the interview
@klou32 thank you
what a fun game you sound like a riot
heres a game try and figure out which ones are the terfs and which are the fascists its harder than you think
haha transexclusionary radical feminists ) like there is a feminism that isnt radical like there is a woman that can be excluded from feminism d
thank you for posting this did rowling argue that all men are rapists i read rowlings essay but dont remember that bit
 is jk rowling the manifestation in female form of the toxic male white priviledged heirarchy standing over the proleteriat intent on deepening oppression and furthering undeserved profiteering through the application of ink onto paper to peddle society undermining evil by suggesting that female human beings menstruate
@mrwevans the way you reason is more worrying still sounds like (imagine a pull on the earlobe)
@blutgeist indra an anagram of eric blair
 your name says everything we need to know about anything you say
@holographic sentience publishers need to sell as many titles as possible rowling was relatively unknown/unpopular as robert galbraith and needed a profile boost and on an egotistical level she/he is clearly desperate to stay relevant motives are not a mystery in capitalist/consumer society its always about the bottom line and/or selfgratification
 she doesnt need help to sell books
@mrwevans if butler was actually supportive of incels youd have a point jk posted a link to an online shop full of terf merch complimenting it
no she didnt i read the essay and i would surely remember that
rowling was/is attentiontrolling to sell her books most recently the cuckoos calling written under the male pseudonym robert galbraith an effective if unnecessary marketing strategy its just unfortunate that her writings just as banal when she identifies as a male
@c or indeed butler avoids guilt by association with incels because it is a nuanced point is rowling entitled to nuance as well
@c or straw man argument
@mrwevans an equally big part of the far right would say boys will be boys and men cant help having urges
@mrwevans lmao no theres a big difference between not accepting biological determinism and failing to acknowledge the violence men enact
@c or if butler argues the not all men point instead then does that mean butler agrees with right wingers or incels who say similar things thats a worrying thought
the ideas of the people she agrees with sort of assume that a specific biology makes someone dangerous in that way
credit where credit is due a masterclass in intellectual dishonesty i was going to comment on what butler is saying but there are so many holes in her argument if it can even be called that that it would take all morning so i will just carry on eating my leftover christmas pudding in awed wonder at how come this woman is a feminist icon
 what covid
@aurora s been one of the best years of my life mate been great watching racist pensioners reap what theyve sown
@paula boddington with xmas pudding not surprised i too feel the need to throw something that goes splat
 i hope your life keeps being as depleted and sad as it seems rn
 why so aggressive smh typical woke puritan response burn the heretic for merely having an opinion that doesnt align with the dogma
 yes oh master i read and i obey since you obvs have superior intellect
@paula boddington get back to your domestic chores and stop commenting on things you dont understand
@dh sumana because i am in the middle of decorating my bedroom
@paula boddington exactly no way is this person a feminist icon except in the minds of a very few men
hi why not start with one or two of your thoughts and criticisms open up the dialogue why not
its almost funny to read the pleased comments of overindulged dottards who are actually taken in by these two ridiculous misoginistic charletans butler and jones gross psuedointellectualism abounds but no feminism in sight
shes the ruin of feminism and women not a feminist icon
how so
im post op transgender female in other words a woman this is the most refreshing thing i have seen in a long time
how can you justify calling judith butler a feminist icon when all she talks about and concerns herself with is males with a trans identity
because she is
storms delaverie instigated the stonewall riots storm was a proud butch lesbian
yes just one of the many history lies in this interview
@gina ritchie marsha selfidentified as a gay man and a drag qeen not trans marsha also said in interviews that they (the drag queens) were not there at the start of the riot and turned up a couple of hours later this history is all on record stop rewriting history butch lesbians started the stonewall riots
@gina ritchie why are you so angry with white men daddy issues
that is true and marsha p johnson a trans woman of color was right behind her cisgender white gay men will tell you they began it all
thankyou for publicising jkr because the more people read her words the more they realise she said nothing hateful or transphobic quite the contrary she stands for all people including women
lol
exactly
well said
lmao thats all i can say
i prefer what j k rowling has to say on the subject
yes me too
 there is no such thing as a female brain brains are plastic and change in response to the environment believing that gendered behavior is innate is sexist and regressive i never said anything about female anything being lesser you need to improve your comprehension skills
 keep believing in pink and blue brains
@mark sanchez i like how not a single word you just said was remotely correct
 the fact you associate a female brain as lesser than a males says more about your values than it does mine kid
 neurosexism yay soooo progressive not
 see the thing is theres no actual evidence for male and female brains but lets pretend youre right for the hypothetical wouldnt that mean that the standard for actually being trans is to get a cat scan or mri and then have the results certified by a doctor how many trans people have actually gotten brain scans done to prove they have female brains and how many claim they have female brains because they id as transwomen
 theres no biological truth that supports said stance as theres no sexed brains id suggest the books by cordelia fine and gina rippon if youre interested in knowing more
@holographic sentience you can literally just google that
 theres a female brain do tell
@mark sanchez because their brains are literally wired as female
 her argument was that if you pretend transgender males are literally women you cant defend the rights of actual women and lesbians
 how can transwomen be women if theyre the wrong sex
so you prefer outright lies to the biological truth that trans women are women trans men are men
whats her argument please remember that i author of adrian mole and the order of antisemitic tropes still exist and buy this book about cuckoos by me robert galbraith
he doesnt even know he is the ffff problem
my brother is gay not a problem he never asked my bout my sex life
no transgender has been in stonewall these are lies marsha was not transgender stop lying
 i am supposed to believe your personal narratives and not the words of public figures who are you btw marsha said on camera he is a gay man
@notyourcis you mean the veterans whom ive met all of whom either knew trans people in the movement or *were* trans try again hypocrite
 veterans from stonewall are still alive wait until they die before you rewrite history
literally not a word you said was remotely true in any way
found the interviewer and interviewee to be very racist eliding the voices of women of colour british feminists a majority of current legal actions in the uk are being undertaken by women of colour gc feminists allison bailey keira bell maya forstater raquel rosariosanchez are the women leading the legal fight for womens rights in the uk these wofc are major leaders of the gc feminist movement owen and judith should educate themselves about the views of british wofc rather than lie and smear british women neither are qualified to speak about this issue and owen if you choose to edit this you show yourself up as a racist
 no worries if youre a man youll be fine
womens rights arent under threat from trans rights
so us women of colour get a free pass at transphobia because were women of colour
@holographic sentience sadly the term racist has lost much of its currency due to its dramatically increased scattergun usage an unfortunate victim of what you call oppression bingo itself a competition within the wider scope of woke olympics
lol congratulations you have won oppression bingo
theracist attack i think doesnt help your case dear mob
butler is not a feminist let alone a feminist icon here she accuses jkr of capitalising on the physical and sexual violence committed by men
welcome to a free independent country owen
 i refer you to my previous comment
 you replied to me trigger
 yet you are happy to troll me on this channel with non feminist issues listen love toxic neofems like you give proper grownup feminists a bad name
@pal whats brexit got to do with anything this is a feminist interview about feminist issues sir
didnt realise owen jones had left the uk wheres he living nowadays
@r ranger as compared to what
feminist icon stop
pft feminist iconpuhleeeese
judith butler is not a feminist icon
kindness collectivity and care is what we need
thank you both for this
thank you for doing this interview owen
@thinking clearly _
@thinking clearly im striving to keep a trace of arguing the litteral opposite now you want to play logics explain how it is possible for me * to presume youre an homophobe * to argue against your assumed homophia * be an homophobe myself now let me mention that homosexuality conceived as exclusively genetic is the most obtuse and neoliberal way to conceve anything its called eugenism stating you have a specific sexual orientation you cant change does not necessarily means that sexual orientation is determined by your genome more likely genetics tends to show the expression of a genome relies upon genetic heritage and environment intertwined there is no historical construction whats is the language youre writing in exclusively a historical construction (and take five to check the definition/use of the word you in any dictionary theres an entry that says anyone everyone people in general _ ) i did not say there was a contradiction in what you wrote i said there was no contradiction where you thought you found one in somebody elses comment what you do is paralogics
@sansa carioca 1 you didnt argue my position you assumed in the rhetoric of your question that i believed there was something bad about certain types of sexuality i corrected you on that assumption there was no contradiction in what i wrote at least none you have demonstrated 2 that is fundamentally wrong regardless of societal norms discources representations laws and repressions you cannot change who you are fundamentally attracted to at best you can oppress people acting openly on their feelings our sexual drives are innate to us by all the evidence available show me a single person who was able to choose or control who they were sexually attracted to and ill show you someone who is lying in their claim 3 there is no historical construction human beings are not blank slates that experience is written upon you really need to get beyond primitve behaviourism which is widely discredited as an idea we have a certain genetic endowment that plays out as a result of millions (in some respects billions) of years of evolution its clear throughout nature that sexuality is a hardwire issue it is part of our genetic program which is why you find all kinds of sexuality amongst nonhuman animals as well as humans you are essentially arguing the position of lgbt conversion therapy of religious bigots who think it is all a choice and so therefore can be saved from their sin
2/ it can be a human construct because sexuality is a norm or a set of norms you dont choose your sexuality the society in which you live did choose its norms in the form of the discourses representations laws and repressions it was funded upon
@thinking clearly ill try this way 1/ i didnt assume your position i argued the contradiction you made because to me it is not a contradiction
@thinking clearly it never happened to me before /
@sansa carioca youtube doing their usual random deletions it is annoying
@thinking clearly i tried to answer you twice on that matter and the comment wont appear
@sansa carioca you can answer to me but your implication about my views are wrong why not challenge the person i was challenging who had the contradictory position it would be more logical
@thinking clearly why cant i answer to you o _ o
@sansa carioca and you are making an ignorant assumption that i would think any kind of sexuality is bad which i do not im pointing out the contradiction in the other posters position can you understand that
@thinking clearly by the negative when you or someone or a church or an institution pops up with a story to say its bad youre wrong whatever it is
 well then it cant be a human construct can it
@thinking clearly no im saying the exact opposite obviously
 hang on sexuality is a human construct so you are saying people voluntarily choose who they are sexually attracted to
 because i (mis)interpreted your comment to mean isaac was wrong on biology but now i see that you were replying to matty kelly and realise were in agreement my sincerest apologies
 so then why are you arguing this point
 more than two human constructs aye i know
 sorry to burst your little bubble but theres more than 2
 thats how human constructs like gender and sexuality work though
@matty kelly thats not how biology works kid
@matty kelly aw thats too bad im still non binary
@isaac nah your male or female only 2 genders
@bellamyblue im non binary
all the men here thanking owen its very clear who butlerstyle feminism benefits and its not women
this is the best crossover since the avengers
fantastic who on earth dislikes an interview with judith butler weirdos
judith butler did a lot of harm her bad ideas gave rise to a hate movement she may have moved on but jk rowling and rest of the haters havent
judith erasing women wot trans women are women
in my view not an icon and not a feminist
@richard fraser i know all i need to thanks all the same
couldnt agree more
definitely not a feminist
get an education
i think some ppl think this is the daily mail comments section jokes aside thanks owen for this free masterclass from judith as a gender and sexuality graduate student whos read judiths work this is realllly valuable
@samuel guest lol ur cute
haha so youve just dropped 40 grand down the drain on the most made up unintelligent useless jargon out there
bhahahahaha
its amazing to see how much selfreflection and humility someone like butler is able to exercise despite her critical acclaim even the fact that she was willing to accept and evaluate her own earlier works on gender performativity based on criticism from the transgender community is also the sort of humility i think more academics and public figures need and the fact that she speaks with such grace and poise shes honestly such an inspiration thanks so much for doing this owen
*they
best performing videos are with peter hitchens hmmm whats happened there then
like i clicked this video mainly because i think butler is an intelligent person and wanted to listen to what they had to say theres a large amount of people who are fascinated with peter hitchens especially on the internet
yanis varoufkis actually had higher views than hitchens
peter hitchens has quite a following on youtube so a lot of those views are probably from hitchens fans rather than regular watchers of this channel
edits comments = echo chamber
@c or because it makes you reject the alternate truths
@ c im not sure how thinking there are some things that are true makes me a stalinist
@george bowling and arent people who are on the side allowed to coordinate discuss and set out their ideas isnt that a fully rational activity and a necessary thing to do alongside debates with opposition
@c or you are all just preaching to the converted talking to yourselves wheres the scrutiny wake up owen jones represents the minority idealised view the grown ups understand this is a delusion
@c or says a lazy stalinist
doing a both sides approach to everything would be exhausting sometimes one side is correct
nature its self is against you cant you see that
@gina ritchie well you show me two people of the same sex have a child without a suragate impossible
@gina ritchie yeah stem is so sexist and transphobic all the studies are funded by cis white men who want to oppress everyone but themselves
there were people like you who claimed the sun travelled around the earth the church even executed people who studied science in order to maintain the idea that what they believed was nature because it maintained the control of the church over peoples lives what they think is true and consequently how they feel and how they identify i feel sorry for you and your emotional commitment to ignorance nature is not on your side nor is history begone
the human race wont exist with you people fighting nature do you not see this
no because that is a ridiculously nonsense assertion in every way
the human race has been fighting nature for as long as its existed why do you think we have computers
did you tweet a call to violence
judith butler is a marvelous and highly necessary intellectual but owen does her an absolute disservice by calling her a feminist icon this is such an horrifically crass and frankly disrespectful way to refer to dr butler
what do you consider disrespectful about it
@thomas obrien i am a woman trapped in a mans body with size 12 feet
what ya smoking
lol i think she is mss tress of woke nonsense
disgusting comments about jk rowling
i know the truth about her is disgusting
by jk rowling fify
found her book horrendous to read but she is great
butler is not a feminist icon
lol butler is not and has never been a feminist icon just sayin
wonderful discussion thank you for this video
@thomas obrien nah

im with her on the idea of not minding the gender youre given in interactions with others what this tells us about how gender is constructed or rather what it points towards is fascinating and to experience that day to day is (i think) a gift
*their
@holographic sentience antagonising a community with as youve referenced a high suicide rate seems sort of evil to me to be honest
@gareth griffiths its a pretty comically low point in discourse to click on videos to give counter arguments to comments without watching the videos theyre comenting on
@lostinthedrone i never thought we would be seeing the rise of a false political elite whose warped ideas would be mere sandcastles on the beach that fail to be washed away because the tide of opinion will not perform its duty
@lostinthedrone i have read just about everything orwell wrote his political writings are still the best the notion hear we are expected to swallow is that by some existential reasoning we are expected to affirm the misguided whims of the mentally unstable
@holographic sentience i thought the suicide rate was a lie now its not ok
@gareth griffiths you do know that the point of newsspeak was to limit the ways that individuals could express their individuality so that they could eventually no longer conceive of themselves as anything but part of the state you have read orwell right
 eh
@holographic sentience you may be on to something there george orwels 1984 demonstrates a mass cultivation of a loss of will to live when external forces conflict with and compell against an internal sense of self and inate immutable desire eventually a person will prefer death to the loss of sovereignty eventually a person has a responsibility in addition to the right to fight for selfactualization liberty or death trying to maintain it comes to mind
humans are sexually dimorphic gender is oppression
@c or howzabout basic reality a man cannot transition to being a woman no amount of makeup clothes hormones or surgery can change that fact perhaps deep down that fact is known by trans people hence the suicide rate amongst that community
aye thatll win the next election
@lostinthedrone why am i not suprised
@gareth griffiths some things are social phenomena thats how people manage to interact at all if everyone started calling you a name you didnt like youd feel weird about it wouldnt you but should everyone ignore basic courtesy to your feelings is that the society youd like to live in
@gareth griffiths you didnt fight any wars and they werent for freedom but merely the power class exchanging blows in order to accrue more wealth and power yes virginia that includes ww2
@gareth griffiths i dont even know what youre on about mate
@c or relate is the word utterly meaningless to think we fought wars for freedom to come to this comical low point in discourse orwell would be laughing his socks off comical nonsense i feel this therefore i am get a grip of reality
@gareth griffiths ah since you dont personally relate it must be imaginary
@lostinthedrone do you believe this guff
@gareth griffiths what are you on about
@lostinthedrone congratulations you have bought into the politics of the emperors new clothes you can now be re assigned your own illogical logic
@gareth griffiths what
wow the politics of nothing well done
all those books you two must be so well read yet we still dont hear the answers to transphobic thinking with advances in technology and social research how come we cant figure this out the polar thinking remains unresolved and needs to be understood thank you for presenting where we are with this x
i love judith butler what an amazing interview thanks for this owen
another nutjob
incredible really highlights how fundamentally lacking in human insight and acknowledgement and how greatly narcissistic and superficial jk rowling is its a form of situational sociopathy she and her fellow terfs suffer from
since when is talking about womens material reality sociopathy although is not something new to hear people have been talking like that about feminists since the dawn of time
its totally okay to be an effeminate male so lets embrace expanding on that beautiful ideal stop reinforcing sexrole stereotypes with gender woowoo stop gaslighting young lesbians please be really openminded and stop thinking that men cant be feminine
means so much to me (as a young trans person) to see judith interviewed properly whenever they get profiled by anyone else the questions primarily consist of isnt it bad that billionaires get criticised on twitter thank you owen and keep it going
gender activism is a cult
i hope someone sends her this video
this womans style of writing is one of the worst ive ever encountered although im sure thats the point
@michael grundy ha ha no i think the colon is fine because you were attempting to create a strong break between the two parts of the sentence to check ask yourself could this be written as two separate sentences if the answer is yes then a colon will be fine i think you could definitely have written your comment as two sentences making your use of a colon acceptable
@honeychurchgipsy6 thank you on reflection i do regret the colon but im hardly going to go back and edit it to appease someone called @angrydonutface
@angrydonutface although you could argue that a semicolon is more correct in that the second phrase provides more information rather than a contrasting piece of information i have no issue with the use of the colon by grundy
shes changed her writing style since this trope about her first came into existence 20 years ago and is incredibly articulate in interviews evidenced in this video michael i beg you to get another hobby
@angrydonutface and what business would you have with my large intestine
says the guy who doesnt understand how colons work
she doesnt end waffling on its almost unbearable
this is fast becoming the best politics show online

residential comedian
gender trouble still being taught in my masters classes and here judith butler has long since moved on so wonderful to hear their updated thoughts and reflections
@andres alegre thank you for explaining academia to me i have to apologize i mistakenly assumed it was clear from my interest and surprise at what is being discussed by judith butler in this video that my issue is not with learning what has come before but with the fact that my syllabi have always stopped at gender trouble and made it seem like this 30 year old work was the most current and up to date material
well you know philosophy is a long dialogue so if you want to jump in or understand what is being discussed you have to know what have been said before
@ c what courses would that be all courses that use butlers work because neither of these commenters mentioned the type of course i discovered butlers work as masters student on an english literature course i came via the idea of language as performative which was the work of jl austen
@jay amin what a waste of time and money these courses are
it is still taught on the alevel course i teach the auther says its 30 years out of date ha
a hugely insightful watch thanks owen
gender is performed i love it since it is performed who is the audience and are there critics of these performances
so you didnt hear her basically say these ideas are bad you didnt pay attention to what is pretty much a repudiation of her former views no
no audience no gender is identity defined by the audience gender is different from sex biological sex is not dependent on audience it is a fact we are animals it serves reproduction
@tweevle the world is a stage you are indeed right
@blog of the w3st i know you think youre making some amazing point but you just sound like a moderately stupid 14 year old performative is not performance which is why theyre spelled differently
@blog of the w3st yeah im using it differently to your examples but im using it in the same way as the claim gender is performed performing an update in no way suggests there is an audience it doesnt relate to how effectively it was done so its not the same as the performance of your car either
@tttttttttttttt youre using perform in a different way the way an actress performs is not the same at all as the way a chainsaw performs
@blog of the w3st perform an update perform surgery who is the intended audience here it can be synonymous with carry out in certain contexts youre ignoring the other meanings of the verb perform when collocated with other nouns
the audience is everyone you interact with who are themselves performing in a feedback loop as for critics well anyone who has been gender nonconforming can speak to their existence all the worlds a stage amirite
@p b but in the context of a vehicle doesnt performance relate more to something like exemplary function a proof of this might be the fact that you would know i was being humorous if you and i took a ferrari that we had just rented out on a race track and then you said this ferrari performed quite well but then i replied yes and how about an encore
@blog of the w3st i dont think performances require an audience in the strict sense for example the phrase high performance vehicle or discussing how an athlete performs relates to authenticity revealed in the present moment like a race or a match this is unlike authenticity revealed in destiny or genesis or heritage or legacy
@kraige trueman but dont performances have intended audiences
@blog of the w3st you dont have to read the book just listen to the interview where gender performativity (and its misunderstandings that you are projecting) is talked about in some depth answering your nonsense question
@jackdw31 what did you like about what she had to say in this book about the audience and critics of gender performances
read judiths book gender trouble its a fantastic introduction
fantastic interview fantastic guest its such a privilege to have access to such engaging educational content for free so thank you owen
one of many pseuds worshipped by wannabes the utter state of it
great minds 21stcentury thinking
you will never find perfect so it comes down to miles behind and miles to go owen you must feel very frustrated at times dont look back just keep going forward you are our voice in the wilderness of greed and dog eat dog world
@kraige trueman you misogynists like to lie yeah whats a woman whats a man
@ben lewis waddington no she doesnt you are lying as many transphobes like to do
@kraige trueman judith supports sex stereotyping thats hate mongering in the real world
@soulfoodie1 glinners more your style get back to him and you claim judith butler is divisive youre a hatemonger
i dont like the smears judith butler talks of suzanne moore as moved by hatred and sees jk rowling as seeking to persecute you cannot have dialogue with people whose views you think are rooted in hate judith butler is not interested in dialogue with her opponents a deeply divisive figure
@dan kragger moores motivated by food lots of it
@kraige trueman i am not in agreement with sm and jkr i just think it is wrong to assume they are moved by hatred it makes dialogue impossible
surely suzanne moore and jk rowling are at the very least just as divisive neither are anywhere near as cogent in articulating a fully rounded position as butler you just find their views more to your understanding
judith butler is the antithesis of feminism couldnt be further from an icon
100%
truly baffled that people in the comments would disagree that butler is a feminist icon gender trouble was so seminal in changing how we interact with discussions of sex and gender and butler has promoted feminism more than most public figures in most of our lifetimes excellent conversation and a mustlisten
people who want her to remove the label of being a feminist are always those who hate trans people the same people call themselves feminists yet wouldnt want to be stripped of that label whilst simultaneously stripping judith of the label supporting trans people doesnt mean youre no longer a feminist these ppl couple trans female violence and cis male violence despite the stats of prisons not supporting that view they just hate trans women full stop
theyre transphobes who think that being trans and supporting the trans community is antifeminist
surviving sexual violence does not make you transphobic stop using such baloney as cover for hatred
loved this thank you for your work
top interview owen thx
i think that judith is being really unfair to suzanne moore moore wasnt being transphobic but asking important questions that allow us to think about how the trans movement affects women suzanne has an interview on youtube which i think is really enlightening and categorically shows that shes not transphobic but is just willing to ask the sorts of questions that need to be asked
@deepak mawar id be inclined to agree with you in instances of isolated debates about contemporary gender issues that has a baseline understanding of respect and dignity to trans lives unfortunately we do not live in a social world like this so to debate many things about trans lives experiences and realities in the public realm is simply to reproduce violence against the trans community in most cases these debates are never politically neutral as to give platform to transphobia is to reinforce its power discursively i assume this is why butler takes the position she does because her entire career has been about interrogating the discursive power of language and its reproduction of power structures surely you could empathize or at the very least understand why we do not debate many experiences facts and realities of lesbian or gay people anymore that we once did because it is a fundamental part of their nature and our natural world trans people are more or less the same but many cisgender people (including yourself) would rather die on the hill of debate than keep on the morally just side of history this is not about censorship it is about respect and understanding of diversity the issues rowling has commented on have been interrogated by those much more intelligent and careful than her in the realms of social science knowledges that are rarely called upon or stated in most media surrounding trans people because we are sensationalized and misunderstood rowling is just one more cisgender woman who is well intentioned at best violently ignorant at worse
@v drake but in my opinion everything should be up for debate by doing that we can better understand why moore was incorrect or correct in her concerns for example this allows for a more thorough conversation and we can evaluate how to better understand these things as long as these conversations take place on a reasonable platform i believe to have these discussions are for the better i understand the danger of it coming across discriminatory oppressive or offensive but to not have a conversation at all can also be a danger
@deepak mawar why should trans lives and people be up for debate this is butlers entire position and point and has been for over a decade now butler has been writing about whose lives are seen as worthy and whose are not and whose lives are seen as something to debate and whose are not since 2005 or even before that cant you see how when your humanity and fundamental parts of being in your life are reduced to talking points or debate issues it comes across as discriminatory oppressive and offensive regardless of how much cisgender people are ignorant to trans lives and realities to constantly parrot this type of discourse in mainstream media creates these types of biases and recreates unfair power structures this is the basis of all of butlers entire philosophical work
@kavafy perhaps if youre in that circle of conversation but i think in the mainstream it isnt the case the trans movement is personally a new debate that im still learning about so i need to hear these conversations that may have taken place plenty of occasions before it really tapped into the mainstream also i think the big issue with the whole moore incident is that the opportunity to have an open discussion isnt there its all too black and white its either youre against the trans movement or youre for it when there should be opportunities for debate happy to hear your thoughts on it though
the thing is that these questions have been asked and answered a million times it gets to a point where its not just asking questions any more its concern trolling and campaigning
you cant ask questions anymore
lockdown tv unherdbrilliant interviewer and interviewee
if you had read marx you would know that he would spit on your misogynistic trans movement
loved this piece really helped shape my thinking and helped me to better position frame my responses on transphobia well done
lmao riiigght
at 4200 owne jones begins a discussion of the tory government criticizing postmodernism and its pernicious effect on the academies its about time this criticism began the government is right maybe members of the tory party have read lyotard dont deny that out of hand judy
@pomodrum no i simply am asking what your concerns with it are (i also asked for a definition because i would bet my life no conservative on the planet has a clue) try reading what i say properly next time
@d j this is very disingenuous judith butlers work is unequivocally postmodern and butlers work has had a massive impact on contemporary educational research and practice along with social constructivism to say that this is a mere conservative slur is high order gaslighting is wikipedia wrong to classify butler as a postmodernist
@ldn stan isnt postmodernism just a boogey man to blame the bad things on at this point
@leemo seems we agree then
@d j postmodernist thinking is rife at my university you are more likely to find a marxist professor than a conservative you may agree with this ideology but dont pretend it isnt there
@d j you have never set foot in any serious academic institution lmfao lol
@dan p i am aware that it is indeed a philosophical movement but the way it is used by right wingers has absolutely nothing to do with the actual meaning it is simply a another scary phrase that is entirely interchangeable with radical marxism critical race theory gender studies etc education is terrifying to conservatives as anything that challenges the status quo nationalistic sentiment or the historical whitewashing of the past is a grave threat
unironically using conservative buzzwords like postmodernism to talk about the state of modernday education simply shows that you have never set foot in any serious academic institution lmfao
judith who is nonbinary and uses they pronouns is a feminist icon you must be dreaming mate
 yes in the same way that gender is a social construct so doesnt exist right
 you said the patriarchy is a social construct so doesnt exist
 the patriarchy is not a simple social construct is the way our society both west and east is organized the oppressed subject are women and the oppressors are men us women are oppressed because of our material reality (sex) and the instrument used for said oppression is gender i dont know which part you dont understand as the word patriarchy is pretty self explanatory
 social constructs do exist where did i say that they didnt
 social constructs do exist money is a social construct the law is a social construct anything culturely shared and made by society is a social construct ie its not natural
 no gender is not constructed it is performative (as butler points out in the video) so its not a question of abolishing gender performativity its about changing attitudes towards gender performativitywhat it means to be feminine or masculine or more realistically a complex assemblage of varying degrees of both to make a whole and authentic person and female emancipation as you so melodramatically put it has in the west already been achieved
 gender is the socially constructed sexist stereotypes we are socialised into performing you know like boys dont cry and girls should focus of looking pretty if you want female emancipation you have to abolish those stereotypes and say girls can do anything boys can do and boys can do anything girls can do
@ignacia smh the patriarchy is a social construct so doesnt exist whos we and whos oppressing youplease be specific
 we dont seek equality we want the dismantling of the patriarchal system and womens liberation of it feminism doesnt aligns with postmodernism nor identity politics as we reject gender ideology and subjectivism because it blurs the lines between oppressed and oppresor
@sofi berezaga feminism is partly about abolishing gender no no it is not well maybe it was in the gender studies module of the media degree in real life feminism is about equality of opportunity and parity with men in all aspects of life anything else is just confused postmodernist navelgazing id politics jibberjabber
@sofi berezaga and the redefinition of feminism continues
@leo t feminism is partly about abolishing gender and it does not consider it an identity we consider gender (femininity and masculinity) an oppression and a way to keep the patriarchal system working judiths theory is the opposite of this because she sees gender as an identity
what what has that got do with anything her work has left a huge mark on gender studies what has her own pronouns got do with anything
another great interview owen thanks
of course she is not going to see the side of feminists who think the abolition of defined sexual biology has its risks she makes a mint from people who think the opposite
calling butler a feminist is like calling a well a man a woman really neither is true also jk rowling made a statement about womens rights but then neither you or butler believe women should have rights as you have made abundantly clear in your support of fetishists
@ignacia no we need to study the deep psychological disturbances and antisocial behavior of your cohort i havent heard many terfs talk about that aspect also the sheer intolerability of your personalities how can we reintegrate you into society without driving everyone you converse with to want to smash their heads into a wall these are important questions that demand serious study
@thenonomousperson because women who talk about material reality will always upset others and dont worry we dont need anybody studying about us everything we talk about has pretty solid theorical backgrounds in case someone wants to know about it
why are terfs are some of the most obnoxious bigots most bigots make me mad sad etc but terfs are just always way more irritating than the others someone should study this academically
this is an extremely hateful and ignorant comment
were just people we arent fetishists we just want to live peaceful lives
this is incredible thank you so much for the interview there is so much crossover here for my doctorate on minorities punching down via trauma

butler isnt a feminist she bows before the patriachy
@ricky fallon there is no patriarchy its a social construct and is performative
you could call her a gender theorist she does not fight for womens rights or liberation though
a properly rigorous historically informed argument thanks
the use of language in this debate is fascinating
thats how it is sometimes with nonsensical language
@rdhs100 more or less so (until the machines swallow babel)
im coming to believe that its *all* about language
@laura martin thank you i wasnt the only one who had misheard it as such before that is in online dictionaries
@the only channel on youtube do you mean internecine
i had to google the word internessing it wasnt even in an online dictionary a quizlet told me it means very destructive to both sides in a conflict i also found it used elsewhere to mean that
i dont think judith butler is accurately described as a feminist icon
loving these videos owen would be great if you could get jack derrida on although might be quite busy thanks xx
@dan kragger i watched his videos on youtube just the other night so no
i expect he has quite a bit of time now he has graduated from this life a passed on to the next
this is a conversation that is really worth having as a white working class man i feel enlightened thanks ) x
 i think hes being deeply ironic
 sound great anything in mind
the libertarian principle is that that an individuals rights should not extend beyond the point at which they infringe upon anothers i see jk rowling as being involved in a libertarian negotiation between potentially competing rights and should not be condemned as transphobic or hateful but recognised as part of an important conversation to find a balance between different viewpoints after all the left and right in politics do not have to accept each other ideas to be sufficiently tolerant of each other to live as neighbours
@c or what a load of tosh can you prove that the bladder issues are specifically because of this issue there are cases in the uk of girls at schools now not using toilets specifically because they are now unisex because of harrassment and abuse so looks like that unisex idea was detrimental for both women girls and possibly trans again as i stated rushing through stupid policies that dont help women and girls for the sake of a minority is ridiculous in fact its misogynist
the thing is a lot of this is actually about infringing on trans peoples personal freedoms trans folk have disproportionately high levels of bladder infections etc because it is difficult to safely use public toilets by protecting other women from trans women who are not statistically a risk youre actually making it difficult for trans people to safely go about our lives
@robert harwood the refuges interviewed by the women and equalities committee during their review into gender recognition act reform unanimously agreed that the safeguarding model which they have been working with to that point was safe they told the committee that the same process which protects refuge users from abusive cis females who access their service has been and will be sufficient when applied to trans women this means trans women may continue accessing their services with safety being maintained by continuing what the rufuges have already been doing
@p b the principle followed needs to be that no one persons rights should infringe upon anothers and the balance between those rights needs to be negotiated what you have written does not deal with these basics
@p b which refugees and what are these people refugees of im speaking about women and children in western countries who are being discriminated against within their own countries with these new gender identity ideology laws
@r b anti discrimination laws havent been shown to do that and when refuges have a chance to speak for themselves they contradict what you have suggested
@p b yes gender identity ideology when implemented has already been shown to adversely impact women and children why is implementing laws which are in theory supposed to stop discrimination against a minority of gender non conforming individuals considered ok when they have been shown to increase the discrimination and abuse of a vulnerable majority its insane its blatant misogyny
libertarians base their argument that rights are inherent to people in a state of nature and institutions only limit those rights this is evidently false in the question of the age of consent without institutions to establish and police this there would be no protection for children consequently rights understood from a civic perspective ought to aim to solve specific problems if the problem we are solving is gender based violence it is absurd to suppose an abuser will stop abusing when he or she finds out their victim is trans conversely the problem of cis females gaining access to womens spaces and abusing there can be applied with the same effect to trans women who might do the same this was the unanimous opinion expressed by the representatives of refuges in the interviews conducted by the womens and equalities committee on gender recognition act reform
awesome interview shes such a lovely listen thank you owen
not a feminist icon not a single word written by butler is nearly close to feminist theory
butler is not a feminist icon
i dont see the need for such controversy what did jk rowling actually do
@c or nope youre wrong they maintain they same offending rates as men if you have evidence otherwise show me but you cant coz it doesnt exist
@orlando098 only in trans world is it impossible to know the sex of someone without looking at genitals
@ben lewis waddington so all womens bathrooms and changing rooms etc should have someone on hand to inspect peoples genitals then
@c or indeed and they can also access spaces like a womens bathroom without having their passport checked this whole debate is dumb
@orlando098 anti trans merchandise like what
@c or anti trans people have also forgotten somehow that no one has to present their birth certificate to go into a bathroom/changing room etc or other womens space
too many different things to list shes obsessed with trans people over this last year and not in a friendly way for example she recently posted on social media that she loves a product from a certain online feminist shop and it turned out to have a huge section devoted to anti trans merchandise
@c or youre gay so what im bi how dare you presume to speak for all lgbq people you think were all the same with the same ideas and pov really
 trans women have the same offending rates as other women im begging you read any study that you didnt get sent on an anti trans forum
@nick sharman thats sad for you trans people are really cool and youre probably missing out on great friendships by being a bigot
 weird how you cut off the half of the sentence where i made it clear i was talking about a group of people i actually belong to and may know things about
@c or refuge separates male children over the age of 13 from their mothersnot girlsill just let that sink in
@c or statistically the pattern of offending behavior remains the same for males whether they transition or not tws and men have equal rates of offending there is no difference check out the longitudinal swedish study for the most comprehensive research on this
@heather67 no she advocates for trans women to be excluded from womens spaces
@c or so women who have ever been abused by men (its quite common most have at some point) are imagining their instinctive caution around men i honestly cant believe the brazenness of this insinuation owen jones is the worst of mens rights activist he wants to take all womens safeguards based on sex and he has spoken about how he wants kids one day so he also wants to exploit their bodies for that too hes the worst kind of misogynist
@heather67male aggression to women is soaring you could spend the rest of your life ignoring half of the worlds population you might be happy
@m m minority of anyone are always bad apples
how can you talk about womens spaces then
@robert kelly not all but there seem to be lots who are misogynistic
@c or most gay people are pro trans really smh your childish essentialism is risible
@danaura transwoman why are homophobic sexists pretending they are a human rights campaign theyre not youre not protecting anyone just trying to compel your dogma on people
@gill r youre talking to the wrong person
@gill r agreed i want no males with penile inversion in our spaces either
@m m no all transactivists are like that are they
@ben lewis waddington 85% probably more of transwomen do not have the op and even if they do the vast majority are still easily identifiable as male you are showing complete disregard for the autonomy safety peace of mind of traumatised women
@olive green bold of you to talk about colonialism when so many societies had respected and accepted people who wed now consider trans only to have that acceptance destroyed by empire eg british authorities heavily observing / pushing down hijra who were previously respected transphobia is the colonial project not the peaceful existence of trans people
@olive green so you are against transgender people
@olive green men want be men transgender doesnt want to be man anymore then he aint man anymore he a woman
@ben lewis waddington believe what you like im sorry youve been taken in by a bunch of misleading nonsense funded by hate groups it seems genuinely unpleasant for you to be so worried about imaginary problems
@ms tee i wont take your word for it because youre completely incorrect )
@c or tw commit sexual offences at approx the same rates as men dont take my word for it look it up
@c or just seen your mention of a poll that poll that shows women dont want transwomen in their spaces without the full surgery sure that says what you want to believe not
@ben lewis waddington no you just cant believe that trans people are actually in these spaces because you know the terrifying stories youve been warned would happen if they were arent actually playing out but thats because trans people arent a danger grc only covers a new birth certificate its useful for marriage deaths but trans people can have passports and id in their acquired gender without it and access spaces
@c or trans inclusive stonewall have frequently misrepresented the equality act you have to have a grc only about 600 of those have been given out in all these years you are still recognised as your birth sex without one but can still be exempt from womens spaces because of exemption clauses set out lobby groups trying to force your dogma on people doesnt make anything trans inclusive its just an attempt at social engineering one thats failing
@ben lewis waddington its not we arent asking for anything to change in womens lives
@ben lewis waddington im not dismantling anything the uk has been trans inclusive for years people are trying to reverse that even though theres no actual problem
@c or i missed the part when it became womens problem
@ben lewis waddington you sincerely think youd be safe walking around with a diff appearance and name and id that outed you to everyone i wish
@ben lewis waddington im a gay man and most gay people are pro trans
@c or antitrans you want me to go to homophobic and sexist forums that validate your views step away from the misogyny and homophobia youll see the evidence
@ben lewis waddington i want trans people to have respect and access to spaces because i know they are normal human beings and not scary caricatures invented by the same american groups that were campaigning against gay marriage a few years back
@c or i didnt realise i had to look a certain way when i had my id photo done i didnt i could have been non conforming in it and still be a man
@ben lewis waddington look up actual information thats not from anti trans forums youll see the evidence
@ben lewis waddington im aware of that but if a trans person is presenting as their birth sex theyre hardly going to have a problem with their id matching it its the mismatch that causes people to be denied jobs housing etc
@c or i dont youre trying to dismantle womens sex based protections you clown
@ben lewis waddington its easy to label those you disagree with as the outgroup but i havent seen evidence that refuges expressed concern that their safeguarding procedures had been insufficient to that point youre arguing that making no changes to their safely functioning safeguarding model would mean that model stops being safe they all said the same procedures that protect refuge users from abusive cis women are adequate to be applied to potentially abusive trans women
@ben lewis waddington you dont understand a thing about actual safeguarding protocol
@c or evidence
@c or how they present oh men and women arent sex stereotypes
@ben lewis waddington men do pose a higher risk trans women dont
@c or you want females to have males in their spaces who cares what you think
@ben lewis waddington you want other human beings to be obligated to have invasive surgery in order to have documents that match how they present
@ben lewis waddington if you look at statistics most of the uk public support trans people women moreso than men look it up
@c or sorry you framed it as antitrans that females have spaces away from the male sex youre an mra oh like men dont pose any special risk but we have singlesex spaces regardless because its called safeguarding you think we should bin that for your ideological dogma to be affirmed just say you dont think females deserve spaces away from males itll be the truest thing youve probably said on the matter
@ben lewis waddington name one country with a statistically significant problem caused by trans people look at the countries where trans people can change gender easily have they had any increase in issues
@ben lewis waddington does your arm hurt from reaching that hard if any of the lies were true id be happy to discuss safety protocol but given that trans people are ordinary human beings and dont pose a special risk no
@c or the british public disagree including women who dont think a transwomen who hasnt had the surgery should be allowed to use womens spaces
@c or antitrans rhetoric so womens rights are antitrans so youre men rights activists you dont think the female sex deserves spaces away from the male sex
@p b you mean listen to the trans activists invited first not the second group i already did
@ben lewis waddington womens aid an umbrella organisation for ~300 refuges is trans inclusive the majority of anti trans rhetoric comes from online radicalisation
@ben lewis waddington read the interviews conducted by the women and equalities committee on gender recognition act reform the shelters unanimously say that the safeguarding procedures they have to protect survivors from cis abusers would be sufficient to protect survivors from trans abusers
@c or weird how you have baseless anecdotes for that claim not actual data
@heather67 weird how people running actual womens refuges are mostly protrans whereas random people who spend time online arent
lol is this a joke butler is not a feminist icon
@matthew lowery whether you like it or not its the movement that seeks an actual change and the real abolition of the patriarchal system we live in
@di mcgee many think your sect is a disgrace as well
@emilner357 second wave and many of us think butler is an absolute disgrace
depends on your brand of feminism i guess
is the alphabet community still mad a woman defended her rights awww get over yourselves
@e blair fair point i guess the ts feel equally at home attacking you guys too
please do not drag the lgb into this mess
great guest again owen

you labour supporting globalists are so conformist its almost cute
@ryan 354 alleging someone agrees with indoctrination seems a provocative statement to leave unelaborated your language gives me the impression that youre either trolling or are perhaps finding it hard to express yourself without recourse to vague and emotive terms like globalists or indoctrination very curious to hear back x
@p b im not surprised that you cant comprehend that statement
@ryan 354 huh
@p b oh so you just happen to agree with the state/corporate sponsored gender indoctrination lol
you agree with people therefore you must be wrong a genius on the internet
its not an older woman thing all the young women i know are radical feminists and we do not think that people can change sex
@matthew lowery my daughter her husband my son are in their early 30s they all believe in biological sex and know that the transideology is delusionary most of their friends also know that there are two sexes and that it is impossible to change sex
@matthew lowery same old tricks gaslight a person by saying its only you that thinks this it wont work with alix we are aware of your tactics
@matthew lowery im 33 and i know gender identity is a lie designed to hurt women and girls
@matthew lowery thats because all the younger than 50s have been caught in the headlights of a new religion it doesnt say anything about their critical thinking skills
@matthew lowery you run in some strange circles no one really believes men are literally women
@matthew lowery theres an entire movement of gender nonconformers in my group young lesbians make up 50% if not more of my group
@gendermapper because youve successfully alienated any gendernonconforming people from your group butler has already spent years writing about the idea that theres some entirely apolitical biological and objective account of sex you may want to try catching up to her rather than just relying on gut feeling and an unwillingness to engage with feminist theory
i dont know anyone younger than 50 who doesnt believe in trans identity its only really boomers whove failed to understand this
this atomization in niche category of humans is exactly whats going to impede any possible progress on the economic front and keep us in the neoliberal framework
 thats a great question it must work both ways right
is labour class a subset of lgbtq or poc etc or the poc lgbtq are a subset of the labour class
 i disagree my impression is that the conversations about trans rights are about working class trans people caitlynn jenner can afford to use capital to protect herself against the risks poor trans folk face but those who need the protection of access to womens shelters skew massively towards poorer women of colour in precarious employment similarly exceptional cases like idris elba might be able to protect himself against much racial discrimination but working class poc need legislation and enforcement of those laws
@p b well i dont disagree with that proposal but my assessment is that labour class discussion are almost inexistent within the left currently
 thats true with exceptions i think a productive conversation can be had about the diversity of experiences within the working class and the emergent needs of those constituencies it would suck to repeat the mistakes of previous labour governments for instance by not having those conversations
@p b whats at the forefront of their political speech is mostly a subset of that classlgbtq and minorities tend to be part of working class not elites
@kate williamson only class
because progress relies on a material analysis of things like class
how will it do that
feminist iconis it a joke hahaha
even better she isnt a feminist icon she is a santander icon she is patriarchy icon
butler is not feministshe even believe patriarchy nowadays
do you think the bulk of the confusion around this subject comes from the use of the word gender to mean multiple things simultaneously i would say gender is innate and therefore biological and i make a distinction between gender and sex what judith describes as gender seems to me to be best described as gender norms which are of course culturally and temporally contingent that isnt what the vast majority of people outside of a tiny minority think when they hear the word gender though if you want to repurpose a word to mean something new the burden lies with you to be clear in what you are saying
@c or i didnt say anything remotely like that
@marc adams its pretty naive to think that the way hate groups choose to attack us is somehow our fault and avoidable by careful wording
@c or i think it is a big deal because it gives ammunition to people who genuinely want to decrease the rights of transgender people if the people who say they speak for the trans community sound like they are talking utter nonsense it makes it easier to discredit a genuine phenomenon such as transgenderism when the ideology surrounding it is internally inconsistent
@marc adams so i guess im saying no the bulk of the confusion doesnt come from issues with the definition of gender it comes from rhetoric being spread by the same american hate groups that campaigned against gay marriage
@marc adams im just saying speak for yourself like its great youre thinking about it but confusion over definitions isnt a big deal in the grand scheme of things given there are hate groups spreading lies about trans people
@c or let me guess i dont know what im talking about do you want to share any insights other than that
i think theres probably a difference between what personally confuses you and what the general state of the discourse is
@tweevle its understandable why people are absolutely bewildered by concepts like gender is performative when it is clear that what is meant by that isnt gender in the colloquial sense then on top of that people who havent engrossed themselves in progressive academic gender studies are called bigots for saying something like gender is a binary when that is a perfectly reasonable thing to say i honestly think people wouldnt care too much if they werent being asked to believe in things that sound like nonsense thats why this stuff annoys people because at its core its obvious and mundane then it gets dressed up in fancy language to make it sound cutting edge and intelligent
i actually agree with this gender is taken to mean gender identity gender roles and gender expression which are all very different things and causes a lot of the confusion julia serano suggested the term subconscioussex to refer to gender identity in her book whipping girl which i think makes the distinction clear and its a shame it never caught on
@matthew lowery the argument that youve assumed im making is a fairly ludicrous strawman
@matthew lowery i didnt say she was wrong i was simply saying that the word gender is very ill defined and i think that causes confusion and conflict i wasnt making an argument
shes written dozens of books about this and is widely considered one of the most influential living feminist theorists id say shes already taken on the burden of making the argument you havent made an argument at all youve simply said what most people generally think is x and must therefore be correct theres no reflexivity or critical awareness in what youve written here
not a feminist icon
it would be interesting if you interviewed more critical theorists (i think that is the right term) fascinating content
how is this anything other than an echo chamber how about abigail shrier debra soh alice dreger james lindsay helen pluckrose for instance
@owen jones a moderated debate between two disagreeing experts on the topic would be interesting wouldnt it
@owen jones interview jbpeterson or mikhaila
@guest informant its cute how bigots think murray is some kind of scary intellectual heavyweight
@p b yes she does ive read her book and ive read gender trouble i would like to hear those two people with opposing viewpoints have a debate or just talk it through
@marc adams fair point im sure she has a platform which is accesible for you to enjoy her work then
@p b there isnt a comparison between a flat earther and dr deborah soh who did her phd in sex studies and is a credible scientist and author who writes about gender she isnt discredited just because you disagree with her
flat earthers and david icke havent been invited on either im drawing a comparison
@owen jones i would like to hear debrah soh and judith discuss gender though they have precisely opposing viewpoints and both are credible people
@guest informant sometimes taking things seriously means not entertaining people who repeatedly lie about trans issues
@owen jones with regard to this particular topic it is repeatedly asserted not debated that transphobia is so rampant in the uk abigail shrier debra soh alice dreger james lindsay helen pluckrose and others (douglas murray i dare you )) may (or may not) disagree add their context an alternative perspective and open up debate if you think its a serious issue then take it seriously
i dont really think deborah soh deserves the time of day
i dont think peter hitchens or piers morgan qualify as an echo chamber
there was a time when butler was kinda incorrectly explaining transgender her ignorance as a cisfemale lesbian was quite palpable and dangerously almost in line with terf but then she grew and revised her opinion on trans
nothing wrong with getting things wrong if you are willing to listen paitence and empathy are key to making the world a safer more open place for everyone (n she said she didnt identify as a cis)
judith butler is not cis
or to put it another way she just didnt want to be cancelled
i dont agree that judith butler is a feminist icon for some forms of feminism she might be but not for the roots of feminism she had her own ideas which oldtime feminists disagree with
didnt simone de beauvoir say that one is not born a woman a woman is made over time seems that compared to terfs butler is a traditionalist
oh no old feminists dont agree with new feminists how novel
fabulous interviews coming from this channel id love to see angela davis or michelle alexander on here as well
@ c julie bindel would be great or kathleen stock but yeah probably too scary for owen bell hooks might be less scary for him
@ c or anything isnt an echo chamber
@owen jones julie bindel would be more challenging and much more interesting are you afraid of her
love the angela davis suggestion will get on this
jbs work is pretty tough on the old brain cells thanks for sharing
if you cant explain something in simple terms then you dont understand it not sure if that was einstein or feynman but nails the general problem with these vaunted scholars who have an entire ecosystem of language and ideology you need to learn in order to even pretend to grasp what theyre saying all so they can feel smug over the lower class plebs who just dont get it
battle of the aesthetic bookshelves great conversation though enjoying these talks with prominent progressive thinkers we need to get the british left as rhetorically proficient as possible
yes aesthetic perfect adjective
rhetorically proficient
@declan murray owens not a politician hes not elected by anyone
great point and on the bookshelves im glad its not just me noticing that one of the benefits of covid is getting a window into scholars and politicians book shelves the academics and real thinkers always have dishevelled the most dishevelled bookshelves
if everything is constructed then female and male is a construction ok then why do we see predictable differences in competitive sports why do we have separate male and female competitions to protect women i am all for trans rights but if you cant understand this nuanced point and the need for exceptions then you are discriminating biological women
i am not going to respond to this comment because it is incoherent
@klou32 i got this opinion listening to feminist and scientist women if youre banning transgender men from womens sports and transgender women from womens sports for opposite excuses youre just banning trans people for arbitrary excuses which is blatant bigotry the history and the science is pretty clear that trans women dont have any major advantages no one has demonstrated why biological advantages that come with being transgender if there are any are any more unfair than all sorts of biological differences humans have all you have is bigotry and a sexist notion contrary to actual evidence that cisgender women cannot compete with transgender women its naked bigotry indistinguishable from all the concerns about having racially integrated sports
@johnhenry beck no transmen couldnt compete either in womens categories because the higher testosterone levels would be considered doping in womens sport i just couldnt disagree with you more and i think you are a misogynist who has never considered or felt at all concerned with a womans perspective you have your view and are a man based off your name so to be honest i am not at all surprised
@klou32 also you keep forgetting that this sort of ignorant discrimination ends up causing worse problems the other way it will mean trans *men* competing with cis women where they actually do have large testosteronebased advantages
@klou32 bodies arent designed the differences in men are a collection of bimodal distributions there is no hard or clear line between genders there are some things that people who are men on average at are better at and things that people who are women are better at again though your stuff about decades of exposure to testosterone is ignorance and bigotry hrt undoes that in a couple of years and you end up with different musculature than was previously running your skeleton and that actually is a disadvantage of course if we actually allow trans people to get proper health care then it renders those concerns moot anyway because theyll mostly have puberty blocked and get appropriate hormones instead these concerns of yours are imaginary cooked up by ignorant bigoted science denialists who are clearly just imagining a cis male athlete in a skirt rather than reality
@johnhenry beck you cannot deny that womens and mens bodies perform different functions though womens physiology is designed for childbirth and with that comes different muscle to weight ratios the idea that you say there are very little advantage of that in sport is ludicrous fine redesign sport but as yet that has not happened and so we need to consider the role of development and decades of exposure to testosterone and the effect this can have upon physiology and the advantage it poses in sport in some sports it will be more so than others such as boxing i am sorry but if you cannot see that i think you are dangerous to women
@klou32 no no agreeing to disagree with harmful sciencedenialist bigotry women compete separately from men because of christian ideas of it being improper for women to be very athletic at all crumbling while it was still considered very improper for men and women to be seen together some male ego stuff about not being beaten by women too and sports being designed by and for men i think we should redesign how things are done regarding sports in serious ways but as things stand now we have gender segregation im just against discriminating against subsets of women (its not only trans women who are disciminated against with these ignorant bigoted gender tests) the science shows that theres little in the way of advantages trans women have over cis women and then theres the whole business of having to define what is unfair biological advantages why ban a trans woman from competing because shes taller but has much less muscle mass to move the larger frame while someone with multiple advantages over others like michael phelps is just praised for massive advantages this idea that trans women are going to dominate sports is just ignorant based on bigoted fear mongering we have decades of clear evidence that its false
@nick sharman yeh they had to shut her down because she was making too much sense its the identity ideology cancel culture mob who havent even done the least bit of research but claim everything is transphobic they just follow the latest doctrine like sheep
@c or what youre saying is there should be no womens sport then
@klou32 i agree these people have no idea what the ramifications of these new laws are if they do and still dont care they are just straight out misogynists and dont care about females at all
we will have to agree to disagree i think there are physical differences and women fought for their right to compete in sport and had a separate category so that they could have a fair chance of getting on the podium as we know if there were no male and female categories then it would be very unlikely that women would ever win you clearly are for that
@klou32 yes it is fear mongering its also ignorance and science denialism those differences often pale in comparison to other biological advantages like height and so many others it is absolutely not about safety in sport because its based in ignorant bigotry not actual knowledge of sport safety you would have a much stronger case for banning anyone over say 53 from basketball for safety concerns there are far better ways to manage sports than based on genitalia at birth which is what it basically all boils down to if youre worried about those developmental differences with lifelong effects then support better health care for trans kids so they dont get inflicted with the wrong hormones and such
@johnhenry beck it has nothing to do with changing specifically to win its about fairness for women already in college track and field in usa transwomen are breaking records that women have never been able to make why is that its because they have male physiology and its a fact that male physiology at the elite level outcompetes female physiology add to that transwomen can have up to 35 times more testosterone in their system than the average female when competing ( and that is extra testosterone interacting with male physiology ) transmen are not allowed into womens sport with increased testosterone so its a hypocritical stance
it is not fearmongering to dispute the idea that there are minimal physical differences once someone has started taking hormones yes there is individual variation amongst all people but we must accept that development matters and has a lifelong effect that needs to be considered in athletic competition this is about safety in sport so dont start with the transphobia nonsense
@klou32 nobody is saying there arent differences its just that the proscience protransgender people arent hung up on genitalia trying to use cisgender men as a comparison in place of transgender women is just showing a lot of biological ignorance (or outright bigotry) youll find lots of women really offended at the idea they cant compete with transgender women and pointing out that there are plenty of other physical differences that make a far greater difference than averages that go along with the genitalia the idea that very athletic men will just claim to be women to sign up for a competition is a nonsensical fabrication by transphobes sports organizations do have requirements such as being on hormones for months or years and often more which usually ends up placing trans women at a disadvantage biologically weve had trans women competing in the olympics since the 1970s and they havent been taking over sports there arent enough trans women athletes to do so anyway but also our society does not provide any significant benefit to cis men to even briefly claim to be women just to win some athletic competitions its just such a ridiculous fear on its face and as obviously bigoted as the (white supremacist) people so very worried about black athletes
@klou32 but were not talking about men vs women were talking about cis vs trans as defined by those institutions and there is no data from those institutions to support that trans athletes are outperforming cis athletes on an unrepresentative scale
i havent checked that but what i will say is that there is no athletic race distance in which the fastest woman has ever beaten the fastest man maybe thats a fluke i dont know but it appears to suggest a physical strength difference
athletic institutions have data for race times set by trans athletes and as far as im aware there isnt any evidence of a trans take over
@lucy colecloughwell someone is going to have to give here because if it is the case that you can gender identify and then automatically compete in that sport then it has major repercussions on women and womens sport sport may be a distraction to you but in the interests of causing the least harm possible it matters there was a reason that women needed a separate category in sport and they fought for it a lot of the modern discussions appear to forget that
@klou32 i do not personally see that it is as harmful as being scared for your life however i do see how it would be harmful and that is why i think a compromise is needed again though this focus on sports distracts from problems such as gra reform and the recent ruling regarding under 16s hormone blockers
@lucy coleclough can you also see how a sports space becomes mentally and physically harmful for women when biological developmental differences are not recognised
@harry t dyer comparing phelps to the differences between men and women is conflating two different things phelps is still closer to men than he is to women and women still as a group share characteristics that they do not share with men i think this is a poor point
@matthew lowery thats an appeal to authority that is irrelevant the point still stands
@harry t dyer its not about doing gender right it is about causing the least harm possible a woman fighting a man 9 times out of ten will result in a male victory all that needs to happen is for this to be acknowledged and for cases to be considered individually to ensure that there is not any unfair disadvantage in sport
imagine thinking youre making a nuanced point or that the most influential living feminist theorist hasnt thought of it lmao
@isla kennedy thank you the left in general are comfortable with rethinking some fundamental institutions and social relations including revolutionary transformations of economic relations education the relationship between the individual and community etc its extraordinary that sport is so often presented as something that cant be changed as if this is somewhere the revolutionary imagination cannot go
i think its telling that this is the biological distinction we choose to be bound up in policing and not others take for example phelpss biology he has an unfair advantage in a wider wingspan longer legs double jointed ankles all of which give him an unfair advantage over others we celebrate and marvel at his biological advantage and award it yet as butler wrote those who fail to do gender right are regularly punished
from a cis lay perspective my thoughts on sport are sports are a construct historically defined and designed within the patriarchy to showcase the qualities that the patriarchy most valued ie strength rather than flexibility speed rather than dexterity women were a historical addendum for most sports and continue to struggle to be seen as equally important we keep women separate in part because sports were not created to showcase skillsets that would place women above men the sporting capability of men and women (based on how theyve been categorised in the past) are arranged on a distribution and while the averages of each group may be different this is mostly relevant on a population level rather than at the level of individuals successful sportspeople are distinct and unusual for their assigned sex category thats why theyre at the top of their distribution sex is how we have divided our population for sport but given the wide distributions this division includes why not instead divide by a more specific measure that affects success in a particular sport eg height/weight/arm length/muscle mass i feel like the conversation around sport rarely explores what changing preconceptions would look like why not expand our understanding of sport as a more complete measurement of what is possible across all human groups
i mean if we split the world into people shorter than 55 and people taller than 55 wed see a sports difference there too but it wouldnt make it a sensible way to run a society
in regards to sports there is work that needs to be done i think many trans people are willing to compromise in terms of regulation some approach that takes into account physical biases (naturally advantaged cis people included) without putting people in a catagory that doesnt align with their gender competitive sports are a small issue and affects a very small portion of the population talk about sports is often accompanied with speech about protecting womens spaces and this is what worries me there is a huge jump there from a low stakes discussion about sport to a conversation about whether trans people should be allowed in their bathrooms of choice in the correct prison or in safe spaces i like it when progress is made in the conversation about sports but it scares me when this is accompanied by talk about barring me and my peers from places where we feel safe and forcing us to use spaces that are mentally harmful and which pose a threat of violence
do what thou wilt
come as you are
